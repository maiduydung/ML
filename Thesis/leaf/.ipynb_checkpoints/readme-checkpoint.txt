Summary
-------
Leaf shape among Passiflora species is spectacularly diverse. Underlying this diversity in leaf shape are profound changes in the patterning of the primary vasculature and laminar outgrowth. Each of these aspects of leaf morphology—vasculature and blade—provides different insights into leaf patterning.
Here, we morphometrically analyze >3,300 leaves from 40 different Passiflora species collected sequentially across the vine. Each leaf is measured in two different ways: using 1) 15 homologous Procrustes-adjusted landmarks of the vasculature, sinuses, and lobes and 2) Elliptical Fourier Descriptors (EFDs), which quantify the outline of the leaf.

Files
-----
The 555 high-resolution scans in this dataset contain shape information for >3,300 leaves of 40 different Passiflora species. The order of leaves from the vine has been recorded as well. Each scan is a .tif file slightly over 100MB in size. 

all_scans.tar.gz - is the compressed archive of all individual scans held in this dataset, provided for ease of download. MD5sum = 58801a079c6ce84910ba6532d521d5c8

The name of each file contains the relevant identification information for the species of Passiflora scanned and the order of the leaves from the vine. The information in the file names includes 1) species/plant and 2) leaf order from the vine. 

For example:

Pact1_1_17.tif

1) “Pact” refers to Passiflora actinia. Please see species abbreviations below for the 40 species used in this study. The “1” following “Pact” refers to “plant 1”. In this dataset there are also “Pact2”, “Pact3”, “Pact4”, and “Pact5” files because 5 different plants of P. actinia were scanned.

2) “1_17” refers to the fact that this scan includes leaves 1-17 from the vine. The leaf closest to the tip is designated “1” in the scan and higher numbers sequentially refer to leaves as they get closer to the base of the vine. There are variable numbers of leaves for vines as they grow at variable rates, but numbering always starts at “1” at the shoot tip. Sometimes multiple scans were used to scan all the leaves from a vine. In this case, multiple files will have the same species/plant identifier (see point 1 above) as the leaves come from the same plant. The numbers identifying the order of leaves are handwritten in the scans, next to their respective leaves, enclosed with a circle.

Plant materials and methods used to produce the scans:

The plants were germinated from seed, planted between late October 2015 and early March 2016, in Viçosa, at the Federal University of Viçosa, MG, Brazil. The populations were raised and maintained under polycarbonate-covered greenhouse conditions, equipped with automatic environmental control using exhaust fans and evaporative cooling panels (with expanded clay wettable pads). Seeds for each Passiflora species were sown in 128 cell propagation plastic trays (GPlan Comércio de Produtos Agrícola s EIRELI – ME, São Paulo, SP, Brazil) filled with horticultural organic Tropstrato HT Hortaliças substrate (Vida Verde Indústria e Comércio de Insumos Orgânicos Ltda, Mogi Mirim, SP, Brazil). After germination (30-40 days), plantlets were individually transplanted to 5 L capacity plastic pots (EME-A-EME  Ind. Com. Ltda., Petrópolis, RJ, Brazil) filled with horticultural substrate. Each pot received 5 g of Osmocote® Plus NPK 15-09-12 3-4 month controlled release fertilizer (Scotts, USA). Plants were irrigated on a daily-basis with tap water, and no phytosanitary control was applied.For scanning, a multifunction printer (Canon PIXMA MX340 Wireless Office All-in-One Printer, model 4204B019, USA) was used. A 20 cm metallic ruler was positioned at the bottom of each scanned sheet as a size marker. Leaves were carefully detached, from the base to the tip of the shoot, and affixed to an A4 paper sheet, adaxial face down, using 12 mm-double sided tape (Scotch Model 9400, 3M do Brasil, SP, Brazil). The numbers written near each leaf indicate position in the shoot, in a tip-to-base direction, starting with the youngest leaf at the tip of the shoot.
