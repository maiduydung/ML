"Metal substance tainted Moderna jabs, dealing setback to rollout",['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"August 27, 2021 at 17:55 JST"," The foreign substance found in Moderna's COVID-19 vaccines is a metallic substance, the health ministry announced on Aug. 26. “It is metal and reacts to a magnet, and it likely fell into (the vaccines) in the manufacturing process,” a senior ministry official said. The ministry said the contaminant was found in a total of 390 doses, which were scheduled to be used at eight vaccination centers in Tokyo and Saitama, Aichi, Ibaraki and Gifu prefectures. Staff detected tainted vials and removed them from the lineup for use, the ministry said. The health ministry said there have not been any reports that a tainted jab was administered to someone or any reports of safety concerns as of Aug. 26. But the ministry said there are about 1.6 million doses of Moderna vaccines that may have also been tainted because they were manufactured on the same production line. These vaccines have been distributed at 863 vaccination sites around the country and some have already been administered to people. The ministry said it does not know how many people have received doses from these 1.6 million. But at least 946 people, including 94 lawmakers, have received a possibly tainted Moderna jab. They were used at a workplace inoculation program operated by the Diet, which started on Aug. 16. The Defense Ministry announced that 70,000 doses of possibly tainted Moderna jabs were administered at the Osaka International Convention Center, which is a makeshift large-scale vaccination center run by the Self-Defense Forces in Osaka’s Kita Ward, during the period from Aug. 6 to 20. Chief Cabinet Secretary Katsunobu Kato urged members of the public who have received the vaccine to be on the watch for possible health problems. “If you have felt that something is wrong, please consult your primary physician,” he said at a news conference. The Asahi Shimbun One way to know if an individual has indeed received a Moderna dose that was possibly tainted is to check their COVID-19 vaccination certificate, which typically comes in the form of a sticker received after each vaccination. The certificate shows the lot number the administered vaccine came from, along with the name of the manufacturer. The ministry said the tainted 390 doses share the lot number 3004667. About 570,000 doses with that lot number were imported to Japan. The ministry also released two lot numbers that may have possibly also produced tainted vaccines: 3004734, which contained about 520,000 doses, and 3004956, which had about 540,000 doses. The health ministry has ordered affected vaccination centers to stop administering vaccines from the stock of these 1.6 million doses. Takeda Pharmaceutical Co., which imports and sells Moderna vaccines, is urging personnel involved in vaccinations to check each vial carefully, regardless of its lot number. Even if a vial is not on the ministry’s “do not use” list, staffers should “visually check before use for any abnormality, such as a mixed-in foreign substance,” the company said. CANCELLATIONS AND FRUSTRATIONS Moderna’s COVID-19 vaccines have mostly been used at mass inoculation programs operated by large companies, universities and local governments, among other organizations. The latest revelation has thrown operators of such sites around the country into a mad scramble to deal with the sudden halt of scheduled inoculation programs. For some, it was not the first time they had to cope with a sudden change of schedule, as the supply of Moderna vaccines has often been insufficient and has at times fluctuated. A chamber of commerce and industry in Yamaguchi Prefecture was ready to finally launch an organization-wide vaccination program on Aug. 26. But after the health ministry announced the stoppage earlier that day, the chamber canceled it. Inoculation of its members was initially scheduled to start a month ago, but it was pushed back. The latest announcement forced the chamber to brace for yet another delay of the plan. The Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry has urged the central government to provide information about vaccine safety and the steadiness of supply, and has also requested that replacement vaccines be sent to affected local chambers. The Okinawa Prefectural government scrapped a scheduled inoculation of 500 or so people at the Okinawa Convention Center in Ginowan and stopped taking new appointments. The prefectural government is planning to resume the operation as of Aug. 27 by providing replacement vaccines, but officials said the unforeseeable circumstances have made the situation unclear. Okinawa officials also revealed that possibly tainted vaccines were administered to 1,480 people at the convention center during the period from Aug. 20 to 25. But there have been no reports of any health concerns arising from it. The Iwate prefectural government also announced that 2,477 doses of possibly tainted vaccine were administered at mass vaccination centers run by municipal governments and workplace-related vaccination programs. News of the recall due to the tainted doses has thrown a wrench into the plans of many other organizations as well. All Nippon Airways Co. canceled its company-wide vaccination program scheduled at Haneda Airport in Tokyo on Aug. 26 and 27. The company said about 4,700 doses of possibly tainted vaccines had already been administered. But an ANA representative added, “We have nurses who check each (vial), and no intermixture has been detected.” The University of Tokyo has temporarily stopped accepting new appointments for its own vaccination program, while continuing vaccinations as of Aug. 26 as planned. Scheduled vaccinations at the International University of Health and Welfare’s Akasaka campus, Tokai University’s Shonan campus and Okayama University have also been frozen. SUGA: ‘NO MAJOR IMPACT’ Despite all the confusion and frustration, the central government insists this latest mishap will not cause delays in the nation’s already lagging vaccination rollout. “I have been told that it will not have a major impact on inoculations,” Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga told reporters on Aug. 26. The health ministry said replacements for the 1.6 million doses in question will be sent to affected sites to prevent further delays. But a senior official from the prime minister’s office admitted that it will deal a blow to progress in its vaccine rollout efforts. “Vaccination at (these) sites has been halted for now. So, it will likely have an impact.” ROVI, a pharmaceutical company in Spain that manufactures the Moderna vaccine that has been imported to and used in Japan, said in a statement dated Aug. 26 that it is currently investigating the matter. “The detection of this particulate matter refers to certain vials of one product lot distributed exclusively to Japan,” the company said. The origin of the incident “may be in one of its manufacturing lines,” it said, but “as a precaution, this lot and two adjacent lots have been put on hold.” The company said it, Moderna and Takeda are all working closely with Japanese health authorities “to clarify and solve, if applicable, this incident.”",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14427323
Demand among youths outstrips supply at vaccine site in Shibuya,['By KEITA YAMAGUCHI/ Staff Writer'],"August 27, 2021 at 17:45 JST"," Young people standing in a long line is a common sight in Tokyo's Shibuya Ward, but this time they weren't waiting to buy concert tickets or a trendy new beverage. Instead, they were waiting at a special COVID-19 vaccination center set up for young people by the Tokyo metropolitan government on Aug. 27. No reservation was required for a vaccination at Shibuya Ward’s labor welfare hall . However, as a long line formed from the early morning, even though the center would not open until noon, staff were forced to hand tickets out for admittance. The metropolitan government announced on the Twitter at 7:30 a.m. that it stopped taking vaccination requests at the Shibuya center for the day. The announcement said that all slots were filled and that they apologized to people who were planning to come there. But even after that, a string of young people continued to visit the center, and the Tokyo officials were forced to explain to them that they had finished accepting requests for the day. According to the metropolitan government, it initially anticipated that about 200 people would receive shots of the Pfizer vaccine per day. But on that day, more young people came to the venue than expected. A 28-year-old man, who lives in Kashiwa, Chiba Prefecture, and commutes to Tokyo’s Chiyoda Ward for his job, took the earliest train and arrived at the vaccination venue a little after 7 a.m. At first, he was worried because of the long line but he was able to obtain a ticket. “I realized that many people in the same generation want to get jabs to feel safe,” he said. “I feel sorry for people who lined up behind me and were turned away. The vaccination center should provide more slots.” The metropolitan government plans to adopt a lottery system for the next vaccination day at the center on Aug. 28 and later dates. The vaccinations will be offered at the labor welfare hall every day by Oct. 8, excluding Mondays, Sept. 12 and Oct. 3. People aged from 16 to 39 who live in Tokyo or come to the capital for their job or schooling are eligible for the jabs. They need to bring their vaccination vouchers and identification cards.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14427453
High numbers of undetected virus cases feared as testing falls short,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"August 27, 2021 at 16:50 JST"," There could be “ numerous (unreported) COVID-19 patients” out in public because of the lack of available tests, as foot traffic increased in the capital, experts warned on Aug. 26. The Tokyo metropolitan government’s expert panel on response to the COVID-19 health crisis reported that foot traffic in entertainment and shopping areas in the capital, currently under a state of emergency, increased sharply after the Bon summer holidays. Pedestrian traffic as of the middle of August decreased 29.1 percent from the week prior to the fourth state of emergency, declared on July 12, while the same volume for the week through Aug. 25 dropped only 16.5 percent. The Tokyo metropolitan government has set a 50 percent goal in reduction of foot traffic, but the level is returning to the one seen prior to the state of emergency without the number of new COVID-19 patients dropping sufficiently. The expert panel reported that the daily average of new novel coronavirus cases for the week through Aug. 25 was 4,388, 95 percent of the figure for the preceding week. The positivity rate, however, remained high at 20.7 percent. Experts pointed out the possibility of numerous infections among the population that have not been detected due to the lack of available testing. Foot traffic was recorded for visitors in seven entertainment and shopping areas, including Shinjuku’s Kabukicho and Shibuya. During the daytime between noon and 6 p.m. foot traffic in the areas decreased only 13.3 percent compared to the week prior to the emergency declaration. During late night between 10 p.m. and midnight, considered to be a high-risk period for infections, it also dropped only 14.7 percent. In comparison, foot traffic for the week through Aug. 14 fell 24.7 percent during the daytime while it fell 36.4 percent during the late-night hours. The panel also reported that older adults between 40 and 64 accounted for a higher percentage of the foot traffic than those between ages 15 and 39 during all time frames. Atsushi Nishida, director of the Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Medical Science, who researched foot traffic patterns in the capital, urged those middle-aged and senior citizens to avoid nonessential outings. “The high-risk actions of the middle-aged and senior citizens could threaten their lives and also trigger infections among their families and workplaces,” he said.

The targeted eight prefectures are Hokkaido, Miyagi, Gifu, Aichi, Mie, Shiga, Okayama and Hiroshima. Pre-emergency measures will be additionally placed on Kochi, Saga, Nagasaki and Miyazaki prefectures. The expansion of the state of emergency and pre-emergency measures will be applied from Aug. 27 to Sept. 12. A total of 21 of Japan's 47 prefectures will be covered under the state of emergency once the change takes effect, and 12 will be covered under pre-emergency measures. “(I) have begun to clearly see light (at the end of the tunnel),"" Suga said during a news conference. ""I will decide whether to extend the declaration ending on Sept. 12 by analyzing the COVID-19 vaccination progress, the number of patients with serious conditions, the bed occupancy rate and other factors.” Suga also raised the prospect of vaccine passports as part of Japan's path back to normalcy. “We will consider regaining our daily lives and social-economic activities, such as going to eating and drinking establishments, and events, and taking trips, by using vaccine passports actively,” he said. Shigeru Omi, chief of the government’s expert panel on the response to the COVID-19 health crisis, also attended the news conference. Commenting on the timing for lifting the state of emergency, he said, “The most important thing is how much the strain in the medical care system will be alleviated.” Suga declared that he will decide to use a reserve fund of 1.4 trillion yen ($12.73 billion) for countermeasures against the new coronavirus within this week. “We will respond to urgent tasks, such as the vaccination efforts and procurement of neutralizing antibody drugs.” Suga also spoke about measures to prevent children from getting infected. “The central government won’t ask all schools in Japan to close down at the same time,” he said. But he also said that he will present guidelines swiftly to allow schools and municipal governments to properly decide on whether to suspend schools when infections occurred there. Omi, at the Lower House’s Committee on Health, Labor and Welfare on Aug. 25, said, “Each municipal government should decide whether to postpone to some extent the date when schools will start after the summer break.” The expert panel on the same day recommended that related authorities hand out simplified antigen test kits to kindergartens, elementary and junior high schools from early September. It also urged them to ask municipal governments to give special consideration to teachers who want to get inoculated to accelerate their vaccinations.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14426484

1.6 million jabs halted after tainted Moderna doses discovered,['By KAI ICHINO/ Staff Writer'],"August 26, 2021 at 15:20 JST"," About 1.6 million scheduled jabs of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine have been canceled after contaminants were discovered in some of the vials. The health ministry announced on Aug. 26 that contaminated doses were detected and reported at multiple vaccination sites. It confirmed at least 390 doses of the Moderna vaccine had become contaminated with a foreign substance. The tainted vaccines were initially scheduled for use at eight large-scale vaccination sites in Tokyo and four prefectures: Saitama, Aichi, Ibaraki and Gifu. But officials have halted their use. There have not been any reported safety concerns as of now, the ministry added. The ministry has halted the use of 1.6 million doses of Moderna vaccines manufactured through the same processes as the vaccines that were confirmed tainted. It is unknown how many people have received a dose out of these 1.6 million, distributed to 863 sites nationwide, according to the ministry. The vaccines in question were manufactured in Spain, and Moderna is investigating the makeup of the contaminants. A piece of rubber was reportedly found in other manufacturers’ vaccines, the ministry said. In the process of attaching a rubber stopper to the vial, a piece of rubber can sometimes get through and end up in the vial, it added. Starting from mid-August, inoculators at multiple vaccination sites noticed contamination of Moderna vaccines. They reported the matter to Takeda Pharmaceutical Co., which imports and sells Moderna vaccines. The ministry learned about the problem on Aug. 25. All the Moderna vaccines used in Japan are manufactured by the same company based in Spain, the ministry said. The company conducted large-scale maintenance work and changed its manufacturing process, the ministry said. If the foreign substance turns out to be bits of rubber, the risk of the rubber clogging a person’s blood vessels is low because the vaccine is injected into muscle, the ministry said. But if people who got the vaccine develop concerning symptoms, they should call a health care organization immediately, the ministry said.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14426321

Osaka city starts inoculating residents with AstraZeneca jabs,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"August 23, 2021 at 18:10 JST"," OSAKA--Osaka city has begun mass inoculations using AstraZeneca’s COVID-19 vaccine to speed up the pace of its rollout amid a shortage of Pfizer doses. Health care workers began administering the AstraZeneca vaccine to people on Aug. 23 at Shiromi Hall inside Osaka-jo Hall in the city’s Chuo Ward. The campaign is targeting city residents aged 40 or older. But those aged between 18 and 39 are also eligible under certain conditions, according to city officials. Those include if the person is unable to receive doses of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines because of allergies, or if they have already been given their first shot of the AstraZeneca vaccine abroad. Every Monday, the city’s website and call centers will accept AstraZeneca vaccination reservations for the following week. The central government has supplied the AstraZeneca vaccine to Tokyo as well as Saitama, Chiba, Kanagawa, Osaka and Okinawa prefectures, which have been under a state of emergency, ahead of other regions. It had shipped all the doses for the six prefectures as of Aug. 16, according to the health ministry. The government was initially planning to authorize AstraZeneca only for people aged 60 or older. But it did an about-face after the National Governors’ Association, the ruling Liberal Democratic Party and government officials called for it to be used more widely because of a shortage of Pfizer and Moderna shipments. The government had secured millions of AstraZeneca doses, but they had not been used in Japan due to concerns over rare blood clots reported in people who have received the shots.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14424014
COVID-19 testing failing to catch up to speed of coronavirus,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"August 23, 2021 at 18:02 JST"," The positivity rate for COVID-19 tests has risen in many parts of the country, raising concerns that testing is falling behind the pace at which the coronavirus is spreading. A central government panel has defined the most serious infection situation, stage four, as when the positivity rate reaches 10 percent or more, and stage three at 5 percent or more. As of Aug. 19, the Cabinet Secretariat’s official figure for Tokyo’s positivity rate over the latest week was high: 23.3 percent. It was 34.8 percent in Kanagawa Prefecture, while the national average was 16.4 percent. During an Aug. 20 meeting, Tokyo metropolitan government officials pointed to a failure of conducting tests quickly enough on those who need to be tested. But Tokyo has yet to reach the limit of its capacity for administering tests. What the government refers to as “administrative testing” is available at public expense for those with COVID-19 symptoms or who have been exposed to the virus. As of Aug. 20, 14,000 people on average received an administrative test in Tokyo per day in the last seven days. But according to the metropolitan government, more than 40,000 administrative tests a day can be conducted at about 3,800 health care organizations in the capital. A metropolitan government official denied that Tokyo has scaled back its testing efforts. The low number reflects “the number of patients who go to a health care organization that conducts administrative testing,” the official said. One of the major reasons why the number of administrative tests has grown at such a sluggish pace is because a massive epidemiological study being carried out at public health centers is running behind. The research aims to identify infected people as soon as possible to prevent the virus from spreading quickly. In the study, public health center representatives interview infected people about their recent history, identify people who have been in close contact with them and then test those close contacts. Many of those in close contact with infected individuals are not infected themselves. When the study is being conducted widely, it contributes to an increase in testing and a lower positivity rate. But when the number of infected people increases to a certain point, the study has less of an impact on the numbers. Another reason is that public health centers are preoccupied with many important tasks other than testing, such as finding hospitals to transport patients and monitoring patients’ health conditions. On top of all that, not everyone exhibiting COVID-19 symptoms wants to get tested. The Asahi Shimbun “Last year, there were many people who wanted to take a test even though they had minor symptoms. But not now,” said Fujiki Ishihara, director of the Kitashinagawa Fuji Clinic in Tokyo’s Shinagawa Ward. At the same time, private companies that conduct “self-pay testing” have stepped up their presence. This kind of testing targets people who do not have symptoms and are less likely to have contracted the virus. A subsidiary of the Tokyo-based Kinoshita Group has conducted self-financed tests at 15 locations, including three airports. It can run about 15,000 tests per day. Appointments for tests have been fully booked every day at least as far back as the four-day holiday weekend in July. The positivity rate until early July was about 1.3 percent. But it rose to around 3 percent at the end of the month. The health ministry in July started releasing the number of self-pay tests provided by certain private-testing companies. According to data released on Aug. 22, there were about 1.71 million private tests conducted in the span of about a month up until Aug. 14. During the same period, about 2.55 million administrative tests were conducted. But the positivity rate released by the health ministry and other administrative agencies does not include self-pay tests. In areas where many private tests are conducted, the positivity rates may have become higher than they are in actuality.

18 at-home COVID-19 deaths in Tokyo area since July,[],"August 22, 2021 at 17:01 JST"," At least 18 COVID-19 patients have died at home in the Tokyo metropolitan area since July due to a lack of available hospital beds, an Asahi Shimbun study found. The deaths serve as a fresh reminder of the urgency of securing ways to promptly provide care to patients at home whose condition suddenly deteriorates. In Tokyo and its neighboring prefectures of Kanagawa, Saitama and Chiba, there were three such incidences in July, according to the study. The number jumped to 15 in August. Half of the 18 fatalities were patients in their 50s or younger, the study showed. As Japan grapples with its fifth and largest wave of novel coronavirus infections, 96,857 patients nationwide were recuperating at home as of Aug. 18 without access to hospital care. This is because public health centers initially assessed that their symptoms were not sufficiently serious to warrant hospitalization. On July 7, the figure stood at 4,001. Since then, it has jumped 24-fold. It is not uncommon among patients with COVID-19 for their health condition to abruptly deteriorate to the point they need emergency treatment at a medical center. Public health centers are in charge of determining which patients should be hospitalized and finding hospital beds for them. But a surge in caseloads has made it increasingly difficult for medical centers to admit patients who potentially may develop grave health issues. For the study, the Asahi contacted authorities in Tokyo and the three prefectures, as well as Osaka and Okinawa prefectures, to ascertain the number of patients who died while staying home while fighting the disease. All the prefectures are under a state of emergency. Patients found dead at home or who died after being rushed to a hospital following a rapid worsening of their condition were counted in the study. In Tokyo, there were nine such deaths, one in July and eight in August. Of those, six patients were in their 50s or younger, including a man in his 30s with no underlying health problems. In Kanagawa Prefecture, a man in his 60s and another in his 40s died in July. This month, a woman in her 60s died. In Saitama Prefecture, three men--one in his 40s, one in his 50s and another in his 70s--died while recuperating at home in August. The infection of the man in his 50s was confirmed on Aug. 10. He had a pre-existing health condition. But he was recuperating at home as his symptoms were assessed as mild. He was found dead on the morning of Aug. 15. Three patients, two men in their 60s and a woman in her 80s, died in Chiba Prefecture this month. The woman contracted the virus in late July and stayed home because she reportedly showed no symptoms. Prefectural officials began searching for a hospital bed for her after her blood oxygen saturation level plunged to below 90 percent on the evening of Aug. 10. The normal level is 96 percent or more. Her death was confirmed that night. No hospital bed had been found for her. Osaka and Okinawa prefectures replied that no patients staying home have died since July. In the case of Osaka Prefecture, there were 19 such deaths between March 1 and June 20 during the fourth wave of infections. According to the health ministry, 84 COVID-19 patients died at home nationwide in the first half of this year. Of the total, 71 were in their 60s or older.

Chiba hospital secures beds for pregnant COVID-19 patients,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"August 20, 2021 at 18:00 JST"," A Chiba hospital has designated beds to accept pregnant COVID-19 patients following the death of a newborn after a novel coronavirus patient was unable to find a hospital that would admit her and gave birth at home. Chiba University Hospital will secure some of six beds in its maternal fetal intensive care unit at the perinatal medical center for expectant mothers with COVID-19. The MFICU is a treatment facility where patients at high risk can be hospitalized during their pregnancy, birth and postpartum care. It treats such patients and pre-born and newborn children around the clock. According to the hospital, after the COVID-19 patient’s baby died, doctors talked about the clinic’s examination system and the hospital’s procurement of beds at an online meeting on Aug. 18. The hospital decided to create the beds because its emergency system accepts critical pregnant women without any preconditions. “All the beds for COVID-19 patients have already been occupied, and there is no room for accepting pregnant COVID-19 patients,"" said Makio Shozu, a professor at Chiba University’s Graduate School of Medicine, who specializes in reproductive medicine. "" Our hospital ward, therefore, has to accept them."" “It is very difficult to respond to a childbirth while we prevent the virus from spreading, but we have to do this to allow such a patient to safely give birth,” he added. PERINATAL CARE BEDS IN SHORT SUPPLY As more pregnant women have been infected with the novel coronavirus in the Tokyo metropolitan area, there are not enough hospital beds to accommodate them. “It takes longer to coordinate the childbirth of pregnant COVID-19 patients,” said Kei Kawana, a chief professor of gynecology and obstetrics at Nihon University Itabashi Hospital in Tokyo. “Please talk to your primary care doctors as early as possible.” He said that his hospital has 50 beds or more for COVID-19 patients and has been accepting such patients who were pregnant and were refused by other medical institutions, but that it is getting more difficult to accept them. “The perinatal care system has started to collapse in some areas,” Kawana said. The Japan Society of Obstetrics and Gynecology and other groups asked medical institutions across Japan to boost their medical capacity for such patients on Aug. 10. A health ministry study team recently surveyed 144 pregnant COVID-19 patients in Japan and found that they tended to be at higher risk of developing serious symptoms after their 25 th week of pregnancy. When the uterus expands, it puts pressure on the diaphragm, making it harder for the expectant mother to breathe. If pregnant women get infected with the novel coronavirus, their breathing condition could worsen quickly. The JSOG released a statement on Aug. 14 urging pregnant women to get a COVID-19 vaccination regardless of their pregnancy stage to prevent them from developing serious symptoms. “We have not found any evidence as of now that the vaccine could cause a miscarriage or affect a fetus,” said Toshibumi Taniguchi, an instructor of infectious diseases at Chiba University. “Even if you are pregnant, please get vaccinated when it is your turn.” (This article was written by Noriyuki Shigemasa, Mirei Jinguji and Kazuya Goto.)",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14421997
Hospital rejects Paralympic request to offer emergency care,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"August 20, 2021 at 17:03 JST"," A hospital designated to treat injured or ill Paralympic-related people rejected a request from the Games organizer to also provide emergency care for serious cases, saying it is already too busy with COVID-19 patients. “It’s unthinkable to accept such a request when a response at the level of a natural disaster is required to contain the spread of the virus,” said Yuichi Hamabe, who heads the Tertiary Emergency Medical Center of the Tokyo Metropolitan Bokutoh Hospital in the capital’s Sumida Ward. According to the hospital, it signed an agreement with the Paralympic organizing committee to accept Games-related people, excluding athletes, who are injured or become sick during the event within the framework of general medical services. The organizing committee on Aug. 12 asked the Tertiary Emergency Medical Center to also take in emergency patients who are severely injured or fall seriously ill at competition venues. But the center turned down the request because it is a medical institution designated to treat infectious diseases, including COVID-19, and its medical services are already severely strained by the “explosive growth” in novel coronavirus infections. “The organizing committee made the request just before the Paralympics kick off,” Hamabe said. “That shows it doesn’t think Games can be held safely. Concerned parties should quickly discuss whether to go ahead with the Paralympics.” Other medical institutions designated to accept injured or ill Paralympic-related people during the Games also said they cannot provide additional emergency services. A senior official of one such hospital in the greater Tokyo metropolitan area said those medical institutions cannot give special treatment to the Paralympics because they serve as base hospitals in each region and are responsible for providing medical services to local residents. The organizing committee told The Asahi Shimbun in writing that it is asking designated hospitals to accept patients if medical offices at competition venues cannot deal with the cases. The organizing committee declined to disclose the names of those medical institutions. (This article was written by Hiroshi Ishizuka and Yuki Edamatsu.)",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14421957
"New guidelines eyed for issuing, ending state of emergency",['By KEISHI NISHIMURA/ Staff Writer'],"August 20, 2021 at 13:40 JST"," The government is considering changing its guidelines for declaring and lifting a COVID-19 state of emergency by placing more emphasis on the medical care structure instead of infection numbers, sources said. The possible shift would be aimed at ensuring health care systems do not become overstrained, a problem facing many local governments in the latest surge of the novel coronavirus, they said. When Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga announced an expansion of the state of emergency at his Aug. 17 news conference, he explained that the emergency declaration would be lifted based on the state of the medical care structure. That indicates future attention would be focused on the number of patients with serious symptoms and the ratio of hospital-bed usage by such patients. Shigeru Omi, chairman of the government panel of experts who accompanied Suga at the news conference, said a fundamental point in coming up with an exit strategy would be focusing on the medical care structure, including the number of patients with serious symptoms and the number who are hospitalized. The government currently uses five guidelines in deciding on declaring and lifting the state of emergency. The number of new COVID-19 cases has been considered the leading indicator. An increase in that figure was believed to lead to a rise in the number of those with serious symptoms, putting greater pressure on the medical care structure. Currently, the number of new COVID-19 cases over a week per 100,000 residents has been the main guideline used to declare a state of emergency. A prefecture with 25 or more cases per 100,000 people is considered at the most serious stage 4, where an “explosive growth” in infections is occurring. But in Tokyo, the figure as of Aug. 18 was 236, or close to 10 times the cutoff point for stage 4. “If we keep the guidelines unchanged, there will be no way to lift the state of emergency in the near future,” a Cabinet minister said. Some officials also said new guidelines are needed because the increasing number of people who are vaccinated would decrease the risk of patients developing serious symptoms. However, other government officials voiced skepticism about the possible change, noting that unlike influenza, there are few drugs that can be used to treat COVID-19 patients. A bureaucrat dealing with the pandemic also said criticism would arise from the public if the guidelines were reviewed to make it easier to lift the state of emergency. At his Aug. 17 news conference, Yasutoshi Nishimura, the state minister in charge of economic revitalization who also heads the central government’s efforts against the pandemic, said he would ask experts to consider whether different guidelines or other reference points were needed to make decisions about a state of emergency. He said that as more people are vaccinated, having more than 25 infected people per 100,000 residents over a week may no longer be considered a major problem. Nishimura also indicated that other factors would have to be taken into consideration when reviewing the guidelines, including rate of vaccinations among those in their 40s and 50s, who are now most vulnerable to developing serious symptoms, as well as the hospitalization rate and the number of those with serious symptoms.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14421871

Kyoto eateries whip up industry certification for virus controls,['By RIKAKO TAKAI/ Staff Writer'],"August 20, 2021 at 09:00 JST"," KYOTO--In the age of the novel coronavirus, how can eating establishments make diners feel safe again? The owners of traditional Japanese-style restaurants here think they have found a way. They teamed up to create a certification system to promote restaurants taking thorough measures against the risk of infections to woo back customers. The new system is called “Chef’s Criteria of New Normal,” a name chosen to emphasize that they are setting the highest safety standards for the entire Japanese restaurant industry to adjust to the challenging times. It will be put into operation in September. “Kyoto is the center of Japanese cuisine,” Yoshihiro Murata, 69, president of three-star Michelin restaurant Kikunoi, told a news conference on July 27. “When Kyoto goes into action, it becomes widespread, creating a big movement.” To become certified, restaurants need to meet 100 standards, covering anti-infection measures for private rooms, hygiene-control procedures in kitchens and other actions. Many of the standards are based on numerical guidelines, such as the number of customers based on appropriate calculations and the amount of air required for proper ventilation for each space. The logo of the Chef’s Criteria of New Normal certification system (Provided by the preparatory committee for the Anshin no Shoku Project　certification system) The certification was developed by a committee made up of the owners of 16 established restaurants, including Hyotei, another three-star Michelin restaurant, the 480-year-old Nakamuraro, Kinobu and Minokichi. Armed with subsidies of about 5 million yen ($45,300) from the prefectural government, the restaurateurs spent a year and more than 10 million yen coming up with the new system, a process that included consultations with experts. The certification is issued by a third-party organization after it conducts an on-site survey to ensure the standards are being met. The prefectural government on July 19 announced its own certification system, which hands out stickers to restaurants that meet its 38-point guidelines. But the Chef’s Criteria of New Normal regime is stricter, covering more than twice as many standards. “This system is much stricter than ours because it also involves standards for food hygiene and compliance,” Kyoto Governor Takatoshi Nishiwaki said. “It is an effort aimed not only at preventing infections but also at shaping the future of food culture that will support Kyoto for generations to come.”",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14413954

40 prefectures now at ‘explosive growth’ in new virus infections,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"August 19, 2021 at 16:15 JST"," Forty of Japan’s 47 prefectures are now in the most serious Stage 4 level of “explosive growth” in novel coronavirus infections. The number, based on daily COVID-19 case counts over the week to Aug. 17, was up from 31 prefectures in the previous week. The number of new cases across Japan for the latest week was 131 percent of the figure for the week earlier. Only Fukui and Tottori prefectures have seen decreases in new infections over that period. “The spread of infections never ends,” a member of the health ministry’s advisory panel on COVID-19 countermeasures said at an Aug. 18 meeting. The National Institute of Infectious Diseases estimated that the more contagious Delta variant accounted for more than 90 percent of all new cases in Japan as of mid-August. The number of patients with serious symptoms across the nation was 1,716 on Aug. 17, up by 70 from a day earlier and smashing the record for the sixth straight day. Tokyo accounted for 276 of the seriously ill patients, breaking the previous record of 160 set on Jan. 20. At an out-of-session meeting of the Lower House’s Cabinet Committee on Aug. 18, Masato Imai, a lawmaker of the opposition Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan, asked the government to declare a state of emergency for the entire country. However, Shigeru Omi, chief of the government’s expert panel on responding to the COVID-19 pandemic, recommended a narrower focus. “This issue remains the problem of the Tokyo metropolitan area,” he said. Omi said an intensive response over a short period would be preferable to a state of emergency across Japan. Japan reported 23,916 new COVID-19 cases as of 8 p.m. on Aug. 18, topping the earlier record of 20,362 set on Aug. 13 by more than 3,000. Twenty-seven prefectures confirmed new daily highs in confirmed infections. Osaka Prefecture recorded more than 2,000 new cases for the first time, while Aichi and Hyogo prefectures each topped the 1,000 mark for the first time.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14421041
Japan to release details about Lambda variant infections,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"August 19, 2021 at 15:53 JST"," The central government will soon start releasing information about cases of the Lambda variant of the novel coronavirus that have been identified in Japan. Officials currently make public the number of confirmed “variant of concern” cases, based on the National Institute of Infectious Diseases’ definitions. But the Lambda variant has still not appeared on the list. The government will include Lambda variant cases “in a way that will alleviate public concerns,” Chief Cabinet Secretary Katsunobu Kato said at a news conference on Aug. 18. A top health ministry official said the government also plans to release details about variant of concern and “variant of interest” cases, as defined by the World Health Organization. The WHO has designated the Lambda strain as a variant of interest. The first case of the Lambda variant in Japan was confirmed on July 20 at Haneda Airport in Tokyo. A woman arriving from Peru for the Tokyo Olympics tested positive on arrival. But that information was not made public until Aug. 6, when it was revealed following persistent inquiries by news media to the ministry. Kato said the case was handled “according to the health ministry’s guidelines.” He added, “But people have various interests and concerns.” Takaji Wakita, the head of the NIID, said at a news conference on Aug. 18 that the Lambda variant caused a relative majority of infections in Peru, Chile and Ecuador. “But it is on a declining trend globally,” he said. He said he does not think the Lambda variant is more transmissible than the Delta variant. “There are not many travelers from these three countries. Under current circumstances, the risk of spreading the Lambda variant in Japan is very low.”",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14421032

Ministry officials were supposed to send a list of names of those believed to be in close contact with the woman to the Tokyo Olympics organizer and local governments where they planned to stay. But that did not happen, the ministry said. “It was an omission during our handling of many issues,” a ministry official said on Aug. 18. “A major problem is that we don’t have a system to double-check.” Passengers seated within two rows of the Peruvian woman, both front and back, were likely exposed to the virus.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14421011

Nurses fight to save COVID-19 patients battling virus at home,['By YUSUKE NAGANO/ Staff Writer'],"August 18, 2021 at 19:03 JST"," FUJISAWA, Kanagawa Prefecture--As the number of COVID-19 patients battling the disease at home surges, nurses being dispatched to care for them are reporting cases that suddenly turn severe and illnesses lasting longer than in previous waves. At 9 a.m. on Aug. 16, a team of nurses and other workers began an online meeting at a conference room in a building here to share information on their patients fighting COVID-19 at home. “The family of a man we red-flagged yesterday called 911 that night,” one of the members said of the patient in his 50s. The red flag is a reference to patients with a blood oxygen saturation level reading of 93 percent or under. A reading of 96 percent or above is considered normal. The team convening at the Fujisawa city government’s support center belong to Sophiamedi Corp., a provider of visiting care services in Tokyo’s Shinagawa Ward. They are monitoring the health of COVID-19 patients who are on a waiting list for hospitalization or those requiring a close watch, including a reading of 95 percent or under for blood oxygen saturation levels. They are working in Fujisawa and elsewhere in the prefecture, under a contract with the Fujisawa city government and two other municipalities. As of Aug. 11, 74,135 patients with COVID-19 are recuperating at home across the nation, according to the health ministry, j umping to 13 times the number four weeks earlier. The patients were fighting the disease at home due to public health centers assessing their symptoms as mild or not serious enough to require hospitalization as health care systems around the country are at near full capacity for accepting patients. Most of the patients battling the virus at home, more than 60 percent, are in the Tokyo metropolitan area, including Kanagawa Prefecture. An alarming fact about patients with COVID-19 is that mild or moderate symptoms can worsen abruptly and become fatal. In Tokyo, the deaths of seven patients have been reported so far in August alone, including a man in his 30s with no underlying health conditions. On Aug. 16, the Sophiamedi team called patients in Fujisawa to ask them a list of questions on how they were faring, such as if they had difficulty breathing or if their fingertips had turned purplish. They jotted down the replies and any points that were cause for concern. If patients mention complaints about their health, the team recommends a visit by a nurse or an online interview by a doctor to assess if they need hospitalization. PATIENTS TOLD TO RECOVER AT HOME CAN'T STAND “A month ago, patients could be admitted to hospitals without much trouble, but not anymore,” Ikumi Kondo, a nurse, said. “I hear a growing sense of urgency in their voices.” A month ago, the team was in charge of 11 patients. The number had shot up to 120 as of Aug. 16. To assess which patients need to be hospitalized, the Kanagawa prefectural government has introduced a scoring system. Six points, for example, are given to a patient whose blood oxygen saturation level is 93 percent or under. Patients with a total score of five points or above are supposed to be admitted to hospitals, according to the prefecture’s guidance. But today not all of them are. Some have been denied hospitalization as medical centers have been increasingly stretched over the past weeks with an explosive growth in new cases amid the current wave of infections. Patients recuperating at home are cleared three days after their symptoms have eased and 10 days after they began displaying symptoms. Kondo said patients are remaining ill longer in the latest fifth wave of infections. “In the third wave of infections during the year-end, many patients recovered after their fevers subsided in a couple of days,” she said. “But today, patients are fighting prolonged bouts.” At 2:30 p.m. on Aug. 16, nurse Kazuhiro Shine drove to a patient’s home in the city to determine whether he should be hospitalized. Shine put on protective clothing against the novel coronavirus in front of the entrance of his home. Aug. 16 marked the patient’s seventh day of recuperating at home. The patient, in his 40s, could not stand and sat on the floor near the entrance when Shine met him. It appeared that he had slight difficulty in breathing, but it had not become serious. With relatives at home watching his health, Shine assessed that the patient could continue his recuperation at home. But he conceded that his judgment could have been different if the health care system were not overwhelmed. “It is possible that I may have recommended hospitalization if I had seen him a month earlier,” Shine said. A patient another nurse visited was hospitalized the same day after consultation with a doctor. That day was her 12th spent recuperating at home. The patient, in her 50s, developed a serious condition, with a blood oxygen saturation level hovering between 80 and 90 percent and a fever that ran from above 38 degrees to above 39 degrees for more than a week. Shine, on his way back to the support center, said he had been doing his best to keep his patients alive. But he said fighting the latest wave of infections is proving to be an enormous challenge, compared with previous waves. “We have no clues about when the current infections will peak out,” he said. “It's excruciating to have to run a marathon with no goal in sight.”",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14420354

The total national daily record was broken as more than 23,000 cases were reported as of 6 p.m., topping the previous record of 20,362 on Aug. 13. There were also 1,716 COVID-19 patients with serious symptoms across the nation as of Aug. 17, the sixth consecutive day the record has been rewritten. In Tokyo, metropolitan government officials said there were 5,386 fresh cases on Aug. 18, while Osaka prefectural government officials reported a record 2,296 cases, exceeding 2,000 for the first time. Okinawa Prefecture, the southernmost in Japan, had a record 761 new cases. Meanwhile, the number of cases per 100,000 over the last week for Okinawa came to 310.32, the highest in the nation and well above the 226.83 of second-place Tokyo.

Governors find Japan’s virus countermeasures shockingly weak,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"August 18, 2021 at 18:24 JST"," Prefectural governors are sharply criticizing the central government for not taking stronger measures to fend off the most recent surge in novel coronavirus infections. The government has decided to extend the duration of the state of emergency and add seven more prefectures to the list of places covered by it, as the more powerful Delta variant spreads across the nation at a rapid clip. It also said it will strongly urge people to reduce by half the number of outings they make to crowded areas. But its aim is mainly to restrict entry to commercial facilities and the food floors of department stores, which falls short of the response prefectural leaders are looking for. “When you look at the infection situation today for Tokyo, its metropolitan area and other areas across Japan, can the government curb the spread of the infection with such a measure?” Osaka Governor Hirofumi Yoshimura rhetorically asked reporters on Aug. 17. “I think that they should impose stronger measures.” Yoshimura also said if the bed occupancy rate for patients with serious conditions reaches 50 percent in Osaka Prefecture, he will consider asking large commercial facilities to suspend their businesses and business operators to cancel their events. “We should do something like a lockdown,” he said. The governments of Tokyo, Saitama, Chiba and Kanagawa asked the central government to introduce measures to strongly curb foot traffic at department stores and elsewhere and impose restrictions on using railways and airlines. “I am very disappointed that the central government could not take drastic measures to curb foot traffic,” Kanagawa Governor Yuji Kuroiwa said at a task force meeting on Aug. 17. “Governors’ voices were not reflected in the measures,” he told reporters. “I felt a gap in perception (between us and) the central government. It’s shocking.” The state of emergency will take effect in Ibaraki Prefecture on Aug. 20. But the prefecture currently remains under pre-emergency measures, even though it asked the government to issue a state of emergency for the prefecture on Aug. 3. The daily average of new cases for the week in the prefecture was 189 as of Aug. 3. That increased to 266 cases as of Aug. 17. The prefectural government again asked the central government to declare a state of emergency on Aug. 13. On Aug. 16, Ibaraki Governor Kazuhiko Oigawa declared a local state of emergency. “The situation has reached a disastrous level,” he said. A senior official from the Ibaraki prefectural government said the state of emergency took too long to be issued for the prefecture. “I think the timing was late,” the official said. “I believe that they knew the pace of transmission is faster due to the Delta variant. They should do their measures all at once, not dole them out.” (This article was written by Hiroshi Ishizuka and Kayoko Geji.)",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14420379
BASEBALL/ Virus infections force 2 teams to withdraw from Koshien tourney,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"August 18, 2021 at 17:35 JST"," Two teams have withdrawn from the National High School Baseball Championship tournament after players were confirmed infected with the novel coronavirus, organizers said on Aug. 17. Miyazaki Commercial High School in Miyazaki Prefecture said 13 team members tested positive for the virus while Tohoku Gakuin High School in Miyagi Prefecture said one of its players was infected. “When I think of the players’ disappointment, I am rendered speechless,” Eiji Hatta, chairman of the Japan High School Baseball Federation, said after the Miyazaki school’s withdrawal offer was accepted. “We have been making efforts to prevent the spread of infections, but a group infection has occurred. I am so sorry to put more strain on medical institutions.” The 103rd baseball tournament at Hanshin Koshien Stadium in Hyogo Prefecture is the first held in two years. Last year’s event was canceled because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Miyazaki high school will forfeit its second-round game on Aug. 19 against Chiben Gakuen Wakayama High School in Wakayama Prefecture. Tohoku Gakuin will do the same for its second-round game on Aug. 21 against Matsusho Gakuen High School in Nagano Prefecture. “I truly feel sorry for my team members because they can’t play at Koshien. It’s extremely disappointing,” Mitsuro Hashiguchi, head coach of the Miyazaki high school team, said. According to the tournament organizers, the 35 players and staff of the Miyazaki team arrived at their accommodation facility on Aug. 5. One of the players developed a fever in the early evening of Aug. 14 and tested positive on Aug. 15. Twelve others tested positive at a medical institution by the morning of Aug. 17. A health center said eight people were in close contact with the infected people. The tournament headquarters held an emergency task force meeting on Aug. 16 and judged that the Miyazaki team’s case was a group infection. The school offered to withdraw from the tournament on the morning of Aug. 17. Tohoku Gakuin won its first game on Aug. 11 against Aikodai Meiden High School in Aichi Prefecture. One of the Tohoku Gakuin players had a fever on Aug. 13 and later tested positive. Tohoku Gakuin offered to withdraw from the tournament on the evening of Aug. 17. “If my team plays in the next game, the infected person and people who were in close contact with him could be identified, which might affect the students’ future,” Tsuneyuki Abe, the school’s principal, said. “I feel really sorry, but we decided to bow out of the tournament.”",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14420292
"Involving police in surprise visits to bars, eateries called coercive",['By YOSHITAKA UNEZAWA/ Staff Writer'],"August 18, 2021 at 16:56 JST"," Surprise visits to Tokyo bars and restaurants by metropolitan officials to check for compliance with anti-COVID-19 requests are drawing fire for including police officers, which puts undue pressure on owners, critics say. The manager of an “izakaya” Japanese-style pub in Shinjuku said the first thing he felt was fear upon seeing a group of four strangers suddenly enter his establishment who looked like they had no intention of being customers. The izakaya, run by the man in his 20s, had been complying with the metropolitan government’s requests until about May. But according to the manager, the decision was made to open up because the total rent of group businesses came to about 10 million yen ($91,200) a month. The manager said such explanations were ignored by the visiting metropolitan government officials, who only reiterated their request for cooperation. When asked why a police officer had to be part of the team, a metropolitan government official said it was intended to prevent trouble. Since early August, teams of four have been visiting bars and restaurants in the major entertainment districts of the capital. Two members are metropolitan government officials who are accompanied by a police officer and a firefighter. Media representatives were allowed to observe the visitation program in early August. The visits are intended to convince bars and restaurants to comply with metropolitan government requests to close operations if alcohol is served and to call it a day at 8 p.m. if no alcohol is provided. Before the visits started, metropolitan government officials checked on the exterior of bars and restaurants from July 12 and found that of a total of 129,193 establishments, 4,872, or 3.7 percent of the total, were still open after 8 p.m. The visits were initially focused on five areas, Shinjuku, Shibuya, Shinbashi, Ueno and Ikebukuro. Four days were set aside for the visits from Aug. 3. The four-man teams made their visits for about two hours from 8:30 p.m. and went to about 20 establishments each night. The areas of Roppongi, Akasaka and Kichijoji will be added as target areas and about 700 establishments will be visited by the end of August. Tsutomu Shimizu, a lawyer who belongs to a group trying to create a more positive image for the police, raised concerns that having police officers in the teams could be considered a strong-arm tactic. He said “psychological pressure” would be applied to those subject to the visits because they could become worried that the police might target them for other suspected crimes if they did not comply with the requests. The central government has encouraged including police officers and firefighters in the visiting groups as an effective way to gain cooperation. But currently, the only other prefecture that has turned to the police is Osaka. The four other prefectures currently under a state of emergency have not used police officers on the grounds that it could place undue pressure on the businesses.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14420308

Koike under fire over denials of Olympic link to infection surge,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"August 17, 2021 at 19:05 JST"," Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike, once praised for her anti-virus efforts, now faces increasing criticism over her adamant denials that the Olympics were linked to the explosion of new COVID-19 cases in the capital. Koike has dismissed assertions that hosting the Summer Games was connected to the continuing sharp surge in infections, although studies show that a record-setting number of Tokyoites contracted the virus when the Olympics were being held. Experts on the Tokyo metropolitan government’s panel on responding to the pandemic said Aug. 12 that the novel coronavirus situation in the capital was “out of control.” They added that the virus was spreading at an unprecedented pace. Panel member Norio Omagari, director of the Disease Control and Prevention Center under the National Center for Global Health and Medicine, suggested a link between the Tokyo Olympics and the rising caseload that is overwhelming the medical system. “Crowds were seen outside competition venues and nearby streets to root for Olympians,” he said at the meeting. But Koike bluntly rejected his observation at a news conference the following day. “What he is saying is based on the impression he had,” Koike said. “We have data on the numbers.” She added: “It is important to speak based on evidence, not episodes.” Critics and health experts had repeatedly questioned the wisdom of staging the Olympics in the densely populated metropolis amid the pandemic, even if spectators were banned from attending. They warned that government approval of holding the event could lead many in the public, weary of government-issued states of emergency and “stay-home” instructions, to let their guards down and go out to enjoy the festive mood of the sports extravaganza. But Koike has consistently denied that has happened, citing TV viewing rates exceeding 20 percent during the Games. She has said the Olympics did help people stay home. On Aug. 13, she reiterated her position, saying: “People rooted for athletes while staying home as teleworking became more common. That is why the viewer rating went up.” The same day, the metropolitan government abruptly published a study report that backed the governor’s position. The study compared the flow of people near the competition venues in central Tokyo before and during the Olympics. It concluded that overall, crowds were smaller during the event, compared with the pre-Olympic period, although pedestrian traffic surged temporarily during the Opening and Closing ceremonies and at race competitions held on public roads. Other data, however, showed that during the Olympics, crowds did not thin significantly in Tokyo’s entertainment districts in the late night hours, despite the heightened risk of contracting and transmitting the virus. According to a report from the Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Medical Science, the number of people who stayed outdoors for leisure purposes during the Aug. 1-Aug. 7 week was down by 17.6 percent from the week until July 12, when the capital was placed under its fourth state of emergency. It was also down by 20.8 percent during the July 25-July 31 week, compared with the last week before the emergency declaration. Experts say it takes about two weeks at the longest until an infected individual is counted as a COVID-19 patient, including the incubation period and the time needed to get tested. The infection trajectory in recent weeks points to an explosion of infections when the Olympics were being held until Aug. 8. Tokyo reported a record 5,773 newly confirmed infections on Aug. 13. Two weeks earlier, on July 30, the Olympic Games were in full swing. The seven-day average of new cases, which indicates the extent of the spread, was 3,820 as of the week through Aug. 6, two weeks after the Games opened on July 23. The average soared to 4,264 over the week through Aug. 15. Many bars and restaurants have defied metropolitan authorities’ requests to halt alcohol sales during the state of emergency. Such places were seen full of customers, including those who were not watching the Olympics. Experts note that a big difference in the latest and largest wave of infections in Tokyo since late July is that the highly contagious Delta variant is now responsible for a vast majority of new COVID-19 cases around the capital and the rest of Japan. Early in the pandemic, Koike won accolades for holding frequent news conferences to keep the public informed about the situation in Tokyo and her consistent calls for residents to take anti-virus measures. But her outright dismissal of health experts’ remarks on crowds during the Olympics as a mere “impression” drew criticism even from officials in her own government. “Listening only when experts say something convenient for her and ignoring them at other times raises questions about her perspectives as a leader,” a senior metropolitan government official said. The official also said Koike’s insistence that the flow of people declined due to the positive impact of the Olympics was a far cry from what ordinary people perceived.

More than half of prefectures to go under COVID-19 measures,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"August 17, 2021 at 18:55 JST"," A majority of Japan’s 47 prefectures will be subject to COVID-19 restrictions as the central government grapples with reining in the toughest novel coronavirus wave yet. The government’s task force approved on Aug. 17 not only extending the deadline for the state of emergency and pre-emergency measures, but it also added 17 prefectures to the list on top of the 12 already covered. The state of emergency for six prefectures, including Tokyo, its three neighbors as well as Osaka and Okinawa will be extended beyond the Aug. 31 deadline, until Sept. 12. Seven prefectures will be added under the state of emergency from Aug. 20 until Sept. 12: Tochigi, Ibaraki and Gunma in the greater Tokyo metropolitan area; Shizuoka in the Tokai region; Hyogo and Kyoto, which border Osaka; and Fukuoka on the main southern island of Kyushu. Pre-emergency measures will be implemented as of Aug. 20 for 10 more prefectures: Miyagi, Yamanashi, Toyama, Gifu, Mie, Okayama, Hiroshima, Kagawa, Ehime and Kagoshima. The government’s expert panel dealing with the pandemic gave the proposal its nod at a meeting that same day. Yasutoshi Nishimura, the state minister in charge of economic revitalization who also leads the central government effort against the pandemic, started the meeting with a stark reminder that the nation is in the grips of a more intense coronavirus surge than what it has faced before. “The situation is an unprecedented one around the nation, where the pace at which new infections are spreading is on a totally different scale,” he said. In the 29 prefectures covered by the state of emergency or pre-emergency measures, governors can ask bars and restaurants to refrain from serving alcohol. Those prefectures will also be asked to impose entry restrictions on customers at commercial outlets with a floor space of at least 1,000 square meters. Prefectural governors will also be given the option of asking these outlets to close shop on weekends. It follows reports of infection clusters arising among customers who shopped in congested food-product areas in department stores. Nishimura also said the government would make other requests with the goal of halving pedestrian traffic in congested locations. That includes calling on residents to cut down on the number of their shopping trips by half. COVID-19 cases continue to rise sharply around the nation, due mainly to the more virulent Delta variant. New daily cases topped 20,000 for the first time on Aug. 13, and the number of COVID-19 patients with serious symptoms has also been rising, particularly among those in their 40s and 50s.

He said he will disclose the details “at some point in the near future.” The central government is still discussing if it is necessary to provide an additional third dose of COVID-19 vaccines. “At least for the next year, we have secured enough doses to provide a third shot to people who have received two doses of either Pfizer’s or Moderna’s vaccine this year,” Kono said. But he added, “We need to see how much the immunity is lasting” among people who received early vaccinations, such as health care workers and elderly people. At the same time, he said the government will prioritize providing the second shot to people over offering a third shot to those who are fully vaccinated. The government in July signed an agreement with Moderna Inc. to supply an additional 50 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine. These vaccines will be provided as early as the beginning of next year. The government is also expected to receive 150 million doses of vaccines manufactured by Novavax Inc., a U.S. company, starting from the beginning of next year, but the vaccine has yet to be approved in the United States. Kono said the government has secured the Novavax vaccines as a backup to the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines. Whether people should receive the same maker’s vaccine for their third shot will depend on future research findings, Kono said.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14419563

Okinawa’s popularity exacts a toll as Delta variant surges,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"August 16, 2021 at 18:28 JST"," NAHA--Okinawa Prefecture is in dire straits because of the surge in coronavirus outbreaks--even more so than in Tokyo, which has seen unprecedented levels of infections in recent weeks. In the southernmost prefecture, new cases per 100,000 people in the last week came to 249, surpassing Tokyo’s figure. “Our health care system is on the verge of collapse,” Governor Denny Tamaki said, expressing a sense of heightened alarm on Aug. 12, when the prefecture logged 732 daily new cases, a record at the time. In Okinawa Prefecture, the hospital-bed occupancy rate reached 87 percent and all the beds for severely ill patients were full as of Aug. 11, according to data from the central government’s Cabinet Secretariat. Key factors driving the steep surge in infections include an influx of hordes of tourists from the Tokyo metropolitan area and large cities in the Kansai region, and the highly contagious Delta variant sweeping through the prefecture. Kazutoshi Nakajima, a professor of infectious diseases at Daito Bunka University in Tokyo, said a prefecture that relies on tourism as a main source of revenue, such as Okinawa, will likely see new variants brought in from outside the prefecture. “It is possible that Delta was brought to Okinawa as prefectural officials were succeeding in efforts to contain the coronavirus,” said Nakajima, who served as a member of a World Health Organization team on the response to infectious diseases. Data based on estimates from GPS information on users of NTT Docomo Inc. mobile phones shows that the flow of visitors from outside the prefecture began to decrease after it peaked in early May from the Golden Week holiday period. In fact, the flow of people plunged by more than 70 percent from its peak the week after May 23, when Okinawa was placed under a state of emergency. But the number of new cases began going up in late June, after the state of emergency was lifted for Tokyo and Osaka Prefecture. By the middle of July, new cases rebounded to more than half the numbers logged during Golden Week. The number of new infections declined again in late July due to typhoons. The infection trajectory was moving upward again when summer holidays began along with the Bon season, in which throngs of Japanese travelers head to their ancestral hometowns or vacation venues. Most of the visitors to the prefecture, one of the most popular tourism destinations in Japan, are from Tokyo, Kanagawa, Chiba, Saitama, Osaka, Hyogo, Aichi and Fukuoka prefectures. The Delta variant is now being detected in many new infection cases after more and more people descended on the prefecture in recent weeks. The variant did not show up in coronavirus testing until the middle of June. But then cases of people infected with the highly infectious Delta strain began surging in July. In the week from July 19 to July 25, the Delta variant accounted for 34 percent of newly confirmed infections. Its share soared to 57 percent between July 26 and Aug. 1 and 79 percent between Aug. 2 and Aug. 8. The variant is quickly spreading in Naha, which is the gateway to Okinawa, central areas and places south of the prefecture where many tourist sites are located. A local tourism association on Aug. 11 pleaded with tourists to refrain from traveling to the prefecture due to the overwhelmed health care system. They also urged visitors to take a PCR test at the airport they will depart from if their trips to Okinawa cannot be avoided or postponed. Nakajima backed the association's plea, pointing to the fact that Okinawa is an island prefecture. “They cannot transfer patients to hospitals in other prefectures,” he said. “This is not the right time to go to Okinawa if we are to protect its health care system.”",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14418828

The figure was up 17 from the previous day.

"‘No bed at Narita if you catch virus abroad,’ experts warn vacationers",['By YUKI EDAMATSU/ Staff Writer'],"August 16, 2021 at 17:25 JST"," Anyone thinking of leaving Japan for a summer vacation should consider “scrapping their plans” as no beds are available for COVID-19 patients near Narita International Airport, health experts are warning. The airport in Chiba Prefecture has seen a spate of cases in which a passenger returning from summer vacation abroad has tested positive for the novel coronavirus upon arrival. The traveler then has been quarantined at a designated hotel and developed severe symptoms, but had nowhere to go because beds for COVID-19 patients at area hospitals are full. Entrants to Japan who test positive at an airport are required to stay at a hotel designated by the airport’s quarantine station until they test negative twice. There are currently 60 or so returnees staying at hotels near the airport after testing positive for the virus upon arrival, said Kazunari Tanaka, who heads the quarantine station at Narita Airport managed by the health ministry. Twenty percent of them have displayed symptoms such as fever, Tanaka said. Some have had temperatures that ran nearly 40 degrees. For many, their blood oxygen saturation level has remained at around 93 percent, which requires oxygen therapy. Two to three patients have been diagnosed every week with symptoms that required them to be hospitalized. In these cases, the quarantine station has directly made a request to hospitals in the prefecture to take them in. But many area hospitals have refused the station’s request since around late July as hospital beds became increasingly unavailable. In the past week, hospitals turned down almost all requests to accept COVID-19 patients, Tanaka said. The quarantine center fortunately found a hospital to send patients to, but it is 80 kilometers away. The usage rate of hospital beds for COVID-19 patients in Chiba Prefecture was 67 percent as of Aug. 12, falling into the “stage 4” category. “If the number of returnees who need hospitalization increases, it would deprive Chiba Prefecture residents of valuable beds,” Tanaka said. Preparing for the shortage of hospital beds, the station on Aug. 13 ordered five oxygen enrichment devices that can be used at a hotel to treat quarantined patients. Tanaka is worried that a large number of people who travel overseas for a summer vacation will contract the virus during the trip and bring it back when they return to the airport in Japan. Some countries are allowing the entry of visitors from Japan without requiring an isolation period if an entrant shows proof of a negative COVID-19 test result. Tanaka urges people to “think again if you really need to travel overseas now.” COVID-19 cases are still spreading globally. If a passenger who travels overseas contracts the virus on their trip and is unable to obtain proof of a negative test result, they may be banned from entering Japan.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14418747
Japan’s first Lambda COVID variant brought by Olympic staff,['By TARO ONO/ Staff Writer'],"August 16, 2021 at 17:23 JST"," The first case of the Lambda variant of the novel coronavirus confirmed in Japan was brought by a woman arriving from Peru for the Tokyo Olympics, government sources said. The woman, in her 30s, landed at Haneda Airport in Tokyo on July 20. She tested positive for COVID-19 upon arrival. The National Institute of Infectious Diseases later analyzed the virus data and confirmed that it was a new strain known as the Lambda variant, according to the health ministry and other sources. In Peru, the woman’s point of departure, the Lambda variant has been wreaking havoc. According to Pablo Tsukayama, a Peruvian molecular geneticist at the University of Cayetano Heredia in Lima, who first detected the Lambda variant, the strain's infectability is particularly strong because it has spread quickly in a span of only three months. As of July, 80 percent of the new infection cases in Peru were caused by the Lambda variant, Tsukayama said. The variant has been confirmed in more than 40 countries, mainly in Central and South America. It remains unknown if the mortality rate is higher than other variants, Tsukayama said.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14418825
3 prefectures expected to be added to state of emergency list,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"August 16, 2021 at 17:06 JST"," The government plans to add Kyoto, Hyogo and Fukuoka prefectures to the six currently under a state of emergency to help curb the rapid spread of novel coronavirus infections, sources said. Health Minister Norihisa Tamura and other ministers responding to the COVID-19 health crisis are expected to discuss the declaration at a meeting as early as Aug. 16. The government is expected to officially decide on the declaration for those newly targeted prefectures, which are currently under pre-emergency measures, as soon as Aug. 17. Government officials are also discussing the need to extend the current state of emergency for Tokyo and Saitama, Chiba, Kanagawa, Osaka and Okinawa prefectures, which is set to expire at the end of August. It urges eating and drinking establishments in those areas offering alcoholic beverages to suspend their operations. The government is also seeking to add more prefectures to the 13 that are currently under p re-emergency measures. On July 12, the government extended the state of emergency for Okinawa Prefecture and declared it for Tokyo for the fourth time. On Aug. 2, it extended the declarations until Aug. 31 and designated Saitama, Chiba, Kanagawa and Osaka prefectures, which were under pre-emergency measures, to the state of emergency status. On Aug. 16, the Shizuoka prefectural government asked the central government to place the prefecture under a state of emergency.

Doctor tackles gap in public’s view of COVID-19 symptoms,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"August 16, 2021 at 16:18 JST"," A doctor is leveraging the power of social media to warn people how large the gap is between how they view the severity of COVID-19 symptoms and how medical professionals understand them. And his effort is attracting tremendous attention in Japan. Kosuke Yasukawa, 39, a physician who treats COVID-19 patients in the United States, made an infographic that illustrates this difference in perceptions and posted it on Twitter. It quickly went viral. The graphic warns that someone with moderate COVID-19 symptoms will likely experience the most difficult struggle of their life when battling the illness. The public, however, thinks that someone with moderate symptoms will simply experience some difficulty in breathing. Patients with moderate symptoms are likely to have a fever, cough and struggle to breathe well for days due to pneumonia. “For many people who have never experienced a serious illness, it will be the most difficult condition they experience in their lives,” said Yasukawa, an assistant professor at the medical department of Georgetown University. If it becomes necessary to administer oxygen to a patient, they would be classified under “moderate II.” But based on the U.S. standard, they would fall into a category of “serious.” If patients are put on ventilators, their condition would be considered “serious.” But according to the U.S. standard, they would be categorized under “critical.” Yasukawa is trying to give people a reality check about the dangers of COVID-19. Even for patients with moderate symptoms, their pneumonia can worsen within just a few days and their condition might become serious. He created the illustration out of concern that the public does not understand the terms describing the severity levels of COVID-19 symptoms in the same way that the medical community does. Just 10 days after posting his graphic on Twitter on July 20, 14 million people had seen it. According to the graphic, the general population views mild symptoms as being “like a cold,” while doctors recognize them as “not needing help breathing.” Yasukawa said that all patients without pneumonia are categorized as “mild” in Japan. But mild symptoms vary greatly from person to person. Some patients only have a fever or cough for a short time, while other people also suffer from vomiting, diarrhea or other symptoms. “Many people suffer greatly from a variety of symptoms for days and days,” he said. He added that some people also suffer from side effects, such as malaise, shortness of breath and taste disorders, for months. “Please don’t think of it as just a cold,” he said. The stark warning comes as the much more powerful Delta variant rages like wildfire in Japan and abroad. Yasukawa is urging people to continue to take basic anti-virus measures such as wearing masks, washing their hands, social distancing, getting vaccinated, and ensuring that there is proper ventilation.

No hospital beds available for hundreds of very sick patients,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"August 14, 2021 at 15:55 JST"," An explosive surge in COVID-19 cases has left hundreds of seriously ill patients in the greater Tokyo metropolitan with little or no prospect of receiving hospital treatment as beds are basically filled to capacity. The health ministry reported a record number of COVID-19 patients with serious symptoms, many of whom are being treated in intensive care units. It said 1,478 patients showed severe symptoms on Aug. 12, surpassing the previous record of 1,413 set at the peak of the fourth wave of infections in spring. Hospital beds for patients with serious symptoms were almost filled in Tokyo and its three neighboring prefectures of Chiba, Kanagawa and Saitama as well as Okinawa, the nation's southernmost prefecture. Fresh COVID-19 cases nationwide on Aug. 13 reached 20,366, the first time for the daily tally to exceed 20,000. The Tokyo metropolitan government does not automatically include COVID-19 patients in ICUs as having serious symptoms, so it said there were only 218 serious cases requiring ventilators or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, also known as an ECMO lung bypass machine, as of Aug. 12. But using the health ministry definition gave Tokyo a total of 947 patients with serious symptoms as of Aug. 11. And the pace at which serious patients are increasing has also accelerated. During the fourth wave, it took 53 days for the number of seriously ill patients to reach the 1,400 mark from 400. But this time around, it took just 20 days. Authorities also reported explosive growth in new cases among those still not vaccinated. About 70 percent of patients with serious symptoms in Tokyo are under the age of 60, officials said. The ratios at which hospital beds for patients with serious symptoms were filled as of Aug. 12 hit 81 percent in Tokyo and 96 percent in Kanagawa Prefecture, according to statistics compiled by the Cabinet Secretariat. But an official in Kanagawa coordinating the transport of patients to hospitals said hospital beds were being immediately filled once patients are discharged. A Tokyo official handling hospitalizations said 75 requests were submitted by patients with serious symptoms on Aug. 10, but no hospital beds were available that day for 50 of them. Chiba Governor Toshihito Kumagai expressed fears of an “invisible natural disaster” in the making while talking to reporters Aug. 12, noting that the general public seems to be oblivious to the unfolding crisis that has overwhelmed the medical care structure. While 40 percent of hospital beds for patients with serious symptoms in Chiba are still available, Kumagai said the actual situation was one in which all beds were essentially taken since those still open were being prepared for hospitalized patients with moderate symptoms that suddenly worsen. Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga told reporters Aug. 13 he had instructed Cabinet ministers handling the health crisis to begin considering setting up “oxygen stations” for COVID-19 patients recuperating at home and in need of oxygen inhalation.

Tokyo secures 36 hospital beds for infected patients denied treatment,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"August 13, 2021 at 18:35 JST"," The Tokyo metropolitan government said it has secured 36 hospital beds for COVID-19 patients whose requests for medical treatment are rejected by all hospitals contacted. The 36 beds chosen at 11 Tokyo-run and other hospitals will be used to temporarily treat COVID-19 patients until vacant beds become available, the government said Aug. 12. Only some of the beds can be used to treat seriously ill patients, and the metropolitan government has yet to decide on the specific requirements for access to the beds. Increasingly, hospitals in the capital have had to turn away COVID-19 patients because their beds are already filled up. Infected individuals have ended up stuck inside ambulances or been forced to go home and wait for a hospital bed to become available. Under the central government’s new policy, hospitalizations in areas hit hard by the virus should be limited to patients in serious condition or who are at risk of developing serious symptoms. The Tokyo metropolitan government will try to reduce the number of patients in the latter category by promoting the use of an antibody cocktail therapy. The therapy is believed effective in reducing the risk of serious symptoms developing among obese patients and those with underlying diseases. About 20 special hospital beds for the therapy have been secured in the capital, a metropolitan government official said. Patients aged 50 or older who are at a higher risk of becoming severely ill will be given priority for the special beds. Under the initial phase of the plan, patients recuperating at accommodation facilities will be transferred to the special beds and spend a night there while undergoing the antibody cocktail therapy. The metropolitan government plans to eventually dispatch doctors to an accommodation facility for use as a temporary medical center, and provide the cocktail therapy for patients recuperating at other hotels. The number of hospitalized COVID-19 patients in Tokyo reached 3,667 on Aug. 11, accounting for 56.8 percent of the hospital beds. The number of patients with serious symptoms has increased, particularly among people in their 40s and 50s. The Tokyo metropolitan government defines serious cases as those requiring ventilators or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, also known as an ECMO lung bypass machine. If the health ministry’s definition of “serious” is used, which also includes patients in intensive care units, Tokyo’s bed-occupancy rate for patients in serious condition would be nearly 80 percent. The number of patients recuperating at home in Tokyo was 20,726 as of Aug. 12, up by about 3,800 from a week earlier.

COVID-19 panel: Pedestrian traffic must be halved in Tokyo in 2 weeks,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"August 13, 2021 at 14:06 JST"," Pedestrian traffic must be cut in half over the next two weeks to halt the spiraling COVID-19 situation in Tokyo and avoid preventable deaths, a government panel of health experts said. The panel on Aug. 12 compiled a list of recommendations and called on the central and local governments as well as the general public to intensify their infection-prevention measures. Infected patients in Tokyo are finding it increasingly difficult to find open hospital beds. There has also been a sharp spike in COVID-19 patients who have to recuperate at home. “We are approaching a situation where lives that could have been saved will not be,” Shigeru Omi, the panel chairman, said. The panel pointed out that outings are increasing not only among younger Tokyo residents but also middle-aged people who are at greater risk of developing serious symptoms if they have yet to be vaccinated. The panel said one key goal is to bring the “effective reproduction number,” or how many people a COVID-19 patient has infected, to under 1, which would mean new infections have stopped spreading. It said reducing pedestrian traffic to 50 percent of the level before the start of the fourth state of emergency was the absolute minimum condition to reach that target. The panel recommended that the general public halve outings to congested areas. It also called for more forceful measures to reduce the number of customers at food sales floors in department stores. But the panel also compiled activities that could be continued because they carried a reduced risk of infection. They included visits to parks and libraries. The panel also urged the central and local governments to take immediate steps to bolster the medical care structure as one way to obtain the cooperation of the general public. Saying the pandemic should be dealt with as though medical care was being provided in a natural disaster area, the panel called on authorities to also seek the cooperation of health care professionals who are now not directly involved in treating COVID-19 patients. When asked why the recommendations were issued when the Bon holiday season had already begun, Omi said the intent was to gain some form of an effective result before the scheduled Aug. 31 end of the current state of emergency. Yasutoshi Nishimura, the state minister for economic revitalization who also heads the central government’s effort to deal with the pandemic, did not present any new measures. He only said that continued close cooperation would be sought with prefectural governors. (This article was written by Kai Ichino and Keishi Nishimura.)",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14417055

COVID-19 patients in serious condition topped 200 for the first time to hit a record 218 in the capital as health experts called the spread of infections “out of control.” They issued a dire warning that Tokyoites are on their own to protect themselves as the health care system can no longer function due to the flood of patients. Six new deaths from COVID-19 occurred in the capital, according to metropolitan health officials. The daily average of new cases over the week through Aug. 12 came to 3,976, an increase of 9 percent from the figure for the preceding week. The 218 serious cases represented an increase of 21 from the day before. Metropolitan officials define serious cases as patients requiring a ventilator or ECMO heart-lung bypass machine to breathe. At a Aug. 12 meeting of experts on response to the coronavirus and metropolitan officials, Norio Omagari, director of the Disease Control and Prevention Center under the National Center for Global Health and Medicine, used a strong term to sound an alarm over the capital’s situation. “We are in an emergency as the virus is raging at a disaster level,” he said. It was reported at the meeting that the daily average of new cases over the week through Aug. 11 stood at 3,934, more than double, compared with two weeks earlier, indicating that infections are spreading at an unprecedented pace. Omagari said if the current pace were maintained, the seven-day average of new cases could hit 5,113 on Aug. 25. “We will not be able to save people’s lives” that can be saved under the normal circumstances, he said. “We are at a stage where each of us need to act to protect our own lives.” Masataka Inokuchi, vice chairman of the Tokyo Medical Association, said the capital’s health care system has become dysfunctional due to the deepening health crisis. “Regular medical care, including emergency care and scheduled surgeries, has also been seriously affected,” he said. “Maintaining the health care system would be difficult if the pace of the spread (in the coming weeks) remains at the same level as now.” Hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in Tokyo totaled 3,667 as of Aug. 11, with 56.8 percent of the beds filled, according to officials.

Tokyo doctors fear surge in deaths of virus patients at home,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"August 12, 2021 at 16:17 JST"," Doctors in Tokyo are now making heart-wrenching decisions of telling COVID-19 patients to wait at home for an open hospital bed, knowing that hospital treatment may remain unavailable even if their health deteriorates. In this fifth wave of novel coronavirus infections, many of the patients waiting at home are in their prime. Staff at Shinjuku Hiro Clinic in Tokyo’s Shinjuku Ward were monitoring about 60 COVID-19 patients who were recuperating at home as of Aug. 9. Hiroo Hanabusa, the 60-year-old director of the clinic, said public health centers have increasingly requested house calls for at-home COVID-19 patients or online checkups since late July. In early August, a man in his 60s developed a 40-degree fever and his blood oxygen saturation level dropped to 89 percent. Hanabusa visited the patient at his home, recognized that he should be admitted to a hospital, and called for an ambulance after consulting a public health center. But no hospital beds were available, and the patient, who has a pre-existing condition, was stuck in an ambulance for four hours. Hanabusa had no choice but to supply supplemental oxygen to the patient at his home. Two days later, the man was finally admitted to a hospital. “Our clinic is treating five patients who receive administration of oxygen,” Hanabusa said. At least one of the patients is in their 20s, he said. Under the central government’s new guideline, hospitalization in areas where the virus is surging is limited to those with severe symptoms, patients with moderate symptoms who require oxygen inhalation, and those deemed at a high risk of developing serious symptoms. Local physicians now must decide who should be hospitalized and who should be sent home. The virus spread in some areas is so bad that even patients who require immediate hospitalization have no place to go and must wait at home for the next available hospital bed. “The wait time has gotten longer, from several hours to several days,” Hanabusa said. “If the number of patients further increases, they may never be admitted to a hospital.” In addition, doctors may be unable to save some COVID-19 patients recuperating at home if a shortage of oxygen concentrators occurs. “Whether the pace of improving the medical system can catch up with the huge wave of infections will determine the future,” he said. Hiroshi Suzuki, a 60-year-old doctor at an internal medicine clinic in Tokyo’s Ota Ward, voiced similar concerns. “Patients who are essentially required to be hospitalized are staying at home now. We will soon have to see patients in their 40s and 50s die in their homes,” Suzuki said. Suzuki visited a COVID-19 patient in her 50s who was recovering at home on Aug. 7. The woman contracted the virus in late July, and her medicine had run out. When Suzuki arrived at her home, she was too weak to even get up. The doctor said the woman apparently contracted the virus from her child, and she was at risk of developing severe symptoms based on her age. Suzuki believes there will be an increase in cases of patients’ conditions worsening at their homes. He also said he has heard complaints from at-home patients that they never receive phone calls from public health centers to check on their health. Some patients said they were afraid they would die because of high fevers. The Tokyo metropolitan government has provided food and water to those recovering at home. But some patients told Suzuki that they did not receive a care package even a week after testing positive for the virus. “I am particularly worried about patients who live alone,” Suzuki said. According to the health ministry, 45,269 COVID-19 patients were recuperating at home as of Aug. 4. The number was 11.3 times more than the figure four weeks ago, and 2.4 times more than the total from a week ago. The latest number is also higher than those of the peak periods during the third and fourth waves of infections in Japan. Tokyo leads the nation in the number of patients recuperating at home, with more than 19,000 as of Aug. 11. That is a tenfold increase from the number four weeks ago.

Panel: COVID-19 situation in Japan becoming ‘natural disaster’,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"August 12, 2021 at 14:16 JST"," Two-thirds of Japan’s prefectures are experiencing an explosion of novel coronavirus infections, and a health ministry panel warned that the COVID-19 situation was approaching the level of a “natural disaster.” Nationwide, a daily record 15,812 new COVID-19 cases were reported as of 9 p.m. on Aug. 11. Nine prefectures, mainly in western Japan, posted record high daily tallies. The number of COVID-19 patients with serious symptoms was 1,332 on Aug. 10, up by 102 from the previous day. According to guidelines used by experts to classify infection-spread levels, 31 of Japan’s 47 prefectures were at the most serious stage 4, which indicates an “explosive growth” in infections. At an Aug. 11 meeting, the panel advising the health ministry in dealing with the pandemic pointed out that the sharp increase in new cases was fueling the rise in COVID-19 patients with serious symptoms as well as those waiting at home for a hospital bed to open up. A record high 19,396 infected patients around Japan on Aug. 11 were waiting for an open hospital bed. A man in his 30s who was showing mild symptoms died from COVID-19 the same day. The panel recommended that residents refrain from outings and travel across prefectural borders during the Bon holiday season, noting that a crisis situation could arise, resulting in many deaths. For the one-week period until Aug. 10, there were 77.6 new COVID-19 cases per 100,000 residents, a 1.33-fold increase over the previous week. The experts’ panel has set 25 cases per 100,000 residents as the cutoff line for designating a prefecture as being in stage 4, but 31 prefectures had exceeded that figure. Even in prefectures covered by pre-emergency measures, the figure rose over the previous week. Moreover, the ratio of occupied hospital beds set aside for COVID-19 patients exceeded 50 percent in 16 prefectures. Among the prefectures with extremely high ratios were Okinawa at 86.3 percent, Shiga at 81 percent, Fukushima at 79.2 percent and Kanagawa at 69.1 percent. According to studies by the Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Medical Science, pedestrian traffic in the capital decreased by 4.5 percent between 6 p.m. and midnight in the major entertainment districts in comparison to the previous week. But the level of pedestrian traffic has not fallen to the lowest level recorded during the third state of emergency in Tokyo declared in late April. And pedestrian traffic between 10 p.m. and midnight actually increased by 3.2 percent over the previous week. The more virulent Delta variant has also continued to spread rapidly in not only the Kanto region but also the Kansai region. A study by the National Institute of Infectious Diseases found that about 90 percent of the cases in the Kanto region and about 80 percent of the cases in the Kansai region could be traced to the Delta variant. According to preliminary statistics for June compiled by the health ministry, 5,387 unvaccinated senior citizens became infected, and 232, or 4.31 percent, died. In contrast, of the 112 seniors who became infected even after two vaccine jabs, only one, or 0.89 percent, died. Despite the positive news about the effects of the ongoing vaccination program, the Aug. 11 experts’ panel meeting was filled with gloomy predictions. Hiroshi Nishiura, a professor of theoretical epidemiology at Kyoto University, said if the current pace of new infections continues, Tokyo would have more than 10,000 new cases a day by late August, and the figure could approach 20,000 by early September. Other experts warned against optimism over a declining number of COVID-19 cases during the Bon holiday season. They said the lower infection numbers would be a result of a decrease in testing. “The number of new cases will appear to be falling, but will again increase thereafter,” said Kazuhiro Tateda, a professor of infectious diseases at Toho University. “There are no factors that give hope for a continual decrease.”",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14416315

Responses were obtained from 78 hospitals. The results announced on Aug. 10 found that 27 university hospitals, or 35 percent of the responding institutions, had implemented restrictions on accepting patients in the ICUs. Another 18 university hospitals said there was a possibility they would impose restrictions in the future. “We can assume that the situation is quickly approaching in which lives that in normal times would have been saved will no longer be,” said an AJMC official. Of the responding hospitals, 25 were located in areas covered by the COVID-19 state of emergency, while another 25 were in prefectures where pre-emergency measures are in place. Fifteen hospitals had also placed restrictions on accepting emergency patients, while 18 hospitals said there was the possibility such restrictions would be implemented in the future. Nineteen hospitals had placed restrictions on the surgeries performed, while another 17 said that possibility was likely in the future. Twenty hospitals had placed restrictions on accepting inpatients, while 16 said there was a possibility such limitations would be imposed at a later date. Among the reasons given for the various restrictions were the strained medical care situation caused by the need to care for COVID-19 patients as well as infections among hospital staff.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14415617

"Outside Olympic ‘bubble,’ 170,000 in Japan infected during Games",['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"August 9, 2021 at 15:25 JST"," Olympic organizers praised themselves for holding a “safe and secure” Summer Games in Tokyo, but many outside the “bubble” said the event only fueled the record-setting spread of the novel coronavirus around Japan. Hidemasa Nakamura, the Tokyo 2020 Games’ delivery officer, said at a news conference on Aug. 7 that the rate of positive COVID-19 tests among people involved with the Games was low. Athletes and Olympic-related people underwent a total of 600,000 tests, and 138 had tested positive for the virus as of Aug. 6, Nakamura said. The positivity rate, at 0.02 percent, was “evidence that the Olympics have been held safely and securely,” he said. Under health protocols, athletes and Olympic-related officials were supposed to stay within the “bubble” to prevent a possible spread of infections to the public. Outside of that bubble, the number of new COVID-19 cases reported over the 17-day sports event exceeded 170,000 around the nation, putting a further strain on health care workers. Although the bubble may have limited direct contact between Olympians and the public, it could not contain the festive atmosphere of the Games. Some health experts said it was only natural for members of the public to want to join the festivities of the sports extravaganza that was approved by their government. “I cannot deny that the Olympics have had an indirect impact on the (virus surge),” said Nobuhiko Okabe, head of the Kawasaki City Institute for Public Health who served as a special adviser to the Cabinet on infection controls for the Games. “People can’t help but prioritize a party-like mood,” Okabe said. “The fact that people’s defenses are down poses a risk.” On Aug. 7, the eve of the Closing Ceremony, an alarm frequently sounded at Yokohama Rosai Hospital, informing nurses that a patient’s blood-oxygen level has decreased. “Why in the world do they have to hold the Olympics now?” one of the nurses said. The hospital in Yokohama’s Kohoku Ward has made 32 beds available for COVID-19 patients with moderate and severe symptoms, and 31 were filled on that night. Although staff were busy monitoring and treating the COVID-19 patients, Ryo Takeshita, a 34-year-old emergency medical doctor, had to leave the hospital. He picked up an ID for the Olympics and headed for the nearby International Stadium Yokohama, where the men’s soccer final was about to kick off. He had been assigned to work at a first-aid station at the venue. “I like soccer, and I’m not opposed to holding the Olympics,” he said. “But the hospital is facing a tough time. I can’t help but think, ‘Should I really go?’” He went. Two days earlier, Takeshita was on duty at the emergency room of the hospital. During his overnight shift, the ER received 20 phone calls requesting admittance for COVID-19 patients. “It was an abnormal situation,” he said. The ER often received multiple requests at the same time. Staff had to ask ambulance crews about each patient’s condition and then give priority to those with more severe symptoms. “I just prayed that the patients who were turned down could hang on at their homes,” Takeshita said. Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga has denied the possibility that the Tokyo Olympics were related to the skyrocketing number of new COVID-19 cases. He insisted that the movement of people in busy areas of Tokyo “has not increased from the pre-Olympics period.” The Tokyo metropolitan government and the International Olympic Committee have echoed that view. But sharp increases in congestion of pedestrian traffic have been recorded. According to GPS data of NTT Docomo based on smartphone usage outdoors, an estimated 5,200 people were around the National Stadium at noon on July 23, when Blue Impulse, the Air Self-Defense Force’s aerobatics team, flew over Tokyo to celebrate the opening of the Olympics. That number was up by 3,000 from the weekly average until then. The congestion continued into the night when the Opening Ceremony was held at the National Stadium. During the Olympics, crowds formed around competition venues from time to time, even though spectators were largely banned from attending. Well after the start of the Olympic competitions, the virus was spreading so rapidly in Japan that the government extended the COVID-19 state of emergency for Tokyo and placed three surrounding prefectures, as well as Osaka Prefecture, under that declaration. However, many bars and restaurants have defied government requests to stop serving alcohol, and Olympics-watching drinking parties have been seen and heard around Tokyo. “Why didn’t the central government send a strong message, such as shutting down commercial facilities, when it issued a state of emergency?” Koji Wada, a professor at the International University of Health and Welfare, asked. “If it hesitated to do so because of the Olympics, the impact is huge,” he said.

"Experts: Tokyo could see 10,000 COVID-19 cases a day in 2 weeks",['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"August 5, 2021 at 18:59 JST"," An expert on a panel advising the Tokyo metropolitan government warned on Aug. 5 that the capital could be seeing more than 10,000 daily COVID-19 cases in two weeks' time. The panel of experts at a meeting cautioned that ""an unprecedented and explosive spread of novel coronavirus cases is now under way in the capital.” The bleak description given by the experts was due to the rapid spread of the Delta variant as the dominant strain as well as the daily average of new cases over the past week reaching 3,443, which was 1.78-fold higher than the previous week’s average of 1,936. Panel member Norio Omagari, director of the Disease Control and Prevention Center under the National Center for Global Health and Medicine, presented calculations for what the average would be if the current trend continued. By Aug. 11, the daily average for the week would be 6,129, while by Aug. 18, the figure will skyrocket to 10,909. “That would mean that one out of every 1,000 Tokyo residents was infected,” Omagari said. “There is a need to share a sense of crisis about what the current reality is like.” The panel apparently felt the situation was so dire that a statement was needed that called for switching to a structure to deal with an emergency in all aspects of treatment of COVID-19 patients, from hospitalization to recuperation at home or other accommodations. The panel also observed that 3,399 Tokyoites were hospitalized as of Aug. 4, fast approaching the record figure of 3,427 reached on Jan. 12. The number of COVID-19 patients with serious symptoms also increased to 115 from the 80 of the previous week. The daily average of cases reported to the metropolitan government by local public health offices about not being able to find an open hospital bed for a COVID-19 patient came to 450, much higher than the 270 of the previous week. According to Masataka Inokuchi, vice chair of the Tokyo Medical Association, there were many cases in which patients were asked to recuperate at home because no hospital beds were available. The number of patients recuperating at home or other accommodations also surged to 29,703 from the 16,344 of the previous week. In particular, the number recuperating at home doubled over the previous week to 14,783. At the meeting, Inokuchi said, “We must further strengthen the follow-up mechanism so that we can get an early grasp of when the condition of those at home suddenly worsens and allow for immediate medical treatment to prevent having those recuperating at home from developing serious symptoms.” He also suggested that medical equipment for oxygen inhalation be installed at accommodations where patients are recuperating to allow such facilities to also function somewhat as a medical institution. The panel was also told that testing by the metropolitan government had found that 64.6 percent of the cases for the week through July 25 were due to the Delta variant, indicating a further spread of that variant since only 46.2 percent of the cases in the previous week were attributed to the more virulent strain. Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike pointed to the upcoming Bon holiday season and called on Tokyo residents to stay at home and postpone or cancel trips to family homes and elsewhere.

Coronavirus spreading at most serious rate in 23 prefectures,['By JUN TABUSHI/ Staff Writer'],"August 5, 2021 at 17:06 JST"," The novel coronavirus spread has “reached an unprecedented level” in Japan, with around half of the 47 prefectures now in the most serious stage in terms of rate of new infections, a health ministry expert panel said. The highest stage 4 level for new COVID-19 cases per 100,000 people is 25 over one week. Hit by the highly contagious Delta variant, 23 prefectures surpassed that threshold in the most recent week to Aug. 3. The rates for Tokyo and Okinawa Prefecture, which are both under a state of emergency, were 167.82 and 179.15, respectively. Other prefectures that are taking pre-emergency measures against the virus are also seeing soaring numbers of new COVID-19 cases. The figures were 32.61 new infections per 100,000 people for Fukushima, 46.33 for Ibaraki, 41.93 for Tochigi, 36.41 for Gunma, 30.58 for Yamanashi, and 30.83 for Nara. The national total was 58.54, 2.09 times the number for the preceding week. The total number of new COVID-19 cases in Japan hit a record 14,207 on Aug. 4, after topping 10,000 on July 29 for the first time. Tokyo reported a record 4,166 newly confirmed infections, while neighboring Saitama Prefecture logged 1,200, its new high. Fukuoka, Kyoto, Okinawa and nine other prefectures also renewed their daily record counts on that day. The panel urged authorities and citizens to share a heightened sense of crisis to combat the virus. According to the panel, screenings of positive samples found the Delta variant in 13,523 cases in total as of Aug. 2, almost double the number from the previous week. The National Institute of Infectious Diseases estimates the Delta variant now accounts for about 90 percent of new COVID-19 cases in the Kanto region and about 60 percent in the Kansai region. In Tokyo and eight other prefectures, the occupancy rate of hospital beds surpassed 50 percent, putting them in the most serious stage 4 for that category. Okinawa and Fukushima prefectures reported occupancy rates of 74.9 percent and 72.2 percent, respectively. The virus has also hit the Tokyo Olympics. Organizers said Aug. 4 that an infection cluster broke out at the Olympic Village, and five of 12 Greek artistic swimmers staying there have tested positive for the virus. The remaining seven Greek swimmers left the village and are staying at an outside facility as a precaution. Their test results were negative that day.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14411574
Pre-emergency measures to be expanded to 8 more prefectures,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"August 5, 2021 at 15:41 JST"," The government is expanding coverage of pre-emergency measures to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic to eight more prefectures as records for the number of daily infections are being shattered around the nation. The pre-emergency measures will cover the prefectures of Fukushima, Ibaraki, Tochigi, Gunma, Shizuoka, Aichi, Shiga and Kumamoto, and will be in place from Aug. 8 until Aug. 31. Five prefectures--Hokkaido, Ishikawa, Kyoto, Hyogo and Fukuoka--were placed under the pre-emergency measures from Aug. 2. It took only three days for the central government to decide to further expand the measures. Fukuoka is already asking the central government to declare a state of emergency for the prefecture to bring it in line with Tokyo and the five prefectures already under a state of emergency. A government panel of experts met on the morning of Aug. 5 and gave its consent to the expanded pre-emergency measures. A government task force met in the afternoon the same day to formally approve the decision. “In many areas of the nation, an unprecedented situation has developed causing a sharp increase in new infections at a pace we have never seen before,” Yasutoshi Nishimura, the state minister in charge of economic revitalization who also heads the central government’s efforts to deal with the novel coronavirus pandemic, said at the start of the meeting of the panel of experts. He said the medical care structure in many areas has been placed under enormous stress. Prefectures covered by the pre-emergency measures will be asked to request local bars and restaurants to refrain from serving alcohol, but prefectural governors can relax such requests if new COVID-19 cases are found to be on the decline and infection-prevention measures are in place at the establishments.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14411595
"Despite criticism, Suga sticks with restrictions on COVID-19 care",['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"August 5, 2021 at 14:26 JST"," Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga rebuffed criticism from all sides and stood by his government’s proposal to limit hospitalization of COVID-19 patients to only “serious” cases in areas where medical systems are strained. After ruling coalition lawmakers on Aug. 4 called for a retraction of the measure, Suga told reporters, “I hope to gain the understanding that this measure is intended to allow those who need medical care to receive it.” Under that policy, those requiring hospital care are defined as infected patients with serious symptoms and those at risk of falling seriously ill. COVID-19 patients with moderate or mild symptoms will be asked to recuperate at home. To quell concerns, Suga said the measure was not for the entire nation but only the greater Tokyo metropolitan area where the spread of COVID-19 infections has been especially rapid. He also said measures would be taken to ensure frequent contact with those recuperating at home so that they can been immediately hospitalized if their symptoms worsen. Local governments are preparing for the shift in the hospitalization policy, but doubts are being raised that they will have enough personnel to adequately check on the conditions of the expected increasing number of patients recovering at home. The Tokyo metropolitan government started revising its guidelines for deciding which COVID-19 patients should be hospitalized. The revision would leave out patients with mild symptoms. Tokyo has been hit by a record-setting spread of the novel coronavirus, which has led to a sharp increase in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. As of Aug. 4, there were 3,399 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in the capital. The hospital bed usage ratio has exceeded the 50-percent line that defines an area as being in the most serious stage 4 in terms of the infection spread. The metropolitan government also plans to strengthen observation of patients recuperating at home or other accommodations. A follow-up center was established in November 2020 to monitor such patients, and additional staff will be dispatched to cover the expected increase in those recuperating outside of hospitals. Pulse oximeters are being distributed to at-home patients to monitor their oxygen saturation levels. But about 14,000 Tokyo residents are already recuperating at home. A surge in their numbers could create a situation in which sufficient monitoring is impossible. “Under the current structure we have in place, there is the possibility that adequate follow-ups will not be possible if the condition of those recuperating at home should suddenly worsen,” said a high-ranking metropolitan government official in charge of medical care policy. “The risk arises of a larger number of those recuperating at home dying because they do not receive medical care.” Past waves of the virus have shown that the conditions of patients with mild symptoms can abruptly deteriorate, leading to death. Satoshi Kutsuna, a professor of infection disease control at Osaka University, said the more virulent Delta variant of the novel coronavirus has made matters worse. “Even if a patient is young and has no pre-existing condition, there is the possibility of symptoms becoming serious,” Kutsuna said. “Moreover, even if oxygen saturation levels may be dropping, the patient may not feel any symptoms, such as shortness of breath, if they are resting. “There will be a need for frequent monitoring of such patients to quickly detect when someone’s symptoms have worsened so they can be hospitalized.” In light of the staffing shortages in Tokyo, Kutsuna suggested having doctors and nurses remotely monitor such patients through online systems or by phone.

Tokyo metropolitan government officials confirmed a record 4,166 fresh cases, while the southernmost prefecture of Okinawa had a record 602 cases. The two are among six prefectures where a state of emergency will be in place until Aug. 31. The total figure for Japan on Aug. 4 exceeded 14,000 as of 6:20 p.m., setting a new record.

In Tokyo, the daily average of cases for the week ending Aug. 4 was 3,478.7, which represented an increase of 78 percent over the previous week. Once again, a large percentage of the new cases in the capital was made up of those under 40, with 1,380 patients in their 20s and 885 in their 30s.

More patients remain stuck in ambulances as virus cases surge,['By RYO YAMAGISHI/ Staff Writer'],"August 4, 2021 at 18:53 JST"," More than 2,000 ambulances carrying emergency patients had to wait at least 30 minutes for a hospital to accept them in the week through Aug. 1, a government agency said. The Fire and Disaster Management Agency said the figure, 2,376, double the number logged in the first week of July, was likely the result of hospitals being filled up with COVID-19 patients. The ambulance delays were reported by 52 fire departments in major cities. The latest figure is the highest since January, when Japan was pounded by the third wave of coronavirus infections. Similarly, the ambulance delays are now increasing in tandem with the current surge in COVID-19 cases, according to the agency. The agency has kept weekly tabs since April 2020 on ambulances that had to remain at the patients’ homes for at least 30 minutes after more than three medical facilities could not accept them. During the third wave of infections in December and January, the number of delayed cases reached 3,317 as hospitals were already overwhelmed with COVID-19 patients. The peak during the fourth wave of infections in April and June was 2,064. The number of delays then steadily declined, along with the decreasing number of new COVID-19 cases. There were 1,115 cases of ambulance delays over the week until July 4. But the figure has rebounded and reached 2,202 during the week through July 25. Of the 2,376 cases in the latest count, 1,292 occurred in Tokyo, excluding those in Inagi city and outlying islands, up 14 percent from the previous week.

At-home care for infections proved nightmare in fourth wave,['By TAKEFUMI HORINOUCHI/ Staff Writer'],"August 4, 2021 at 18:38 JST"," KOBE—Tears welled in the eyes of social worker Shoichi Tatsuta when he recalled the sudden deterioration of COVID-19 patients at their homes, the filthy apartments of those too sick to move, and the unanswered pleas of sobbing family members seeking hospital treatment for their loved ones. Those conditions occurred in Kobe during the fourth wave of novel coronavirus infections. The current wave around the country is spreading at a faster pace, and Tatsuya fears a repeat of the hellish situation he experienced, only worse under the central government’s new hospitalization policy. The policy is to provide hospital care only to COVID-19 patients with serious symptoms or at risk of becoming seriously ill. Hospitals will ask those with moderate or less severe symptoms to recuperate at home. Tatsuta, who operates Cosmos, a home-care service provider for seniors in Kobe, said low-risk patients can quickly take a turn for the worse while recuperating at home, and by then, it may be too late to save them. “There were many patients who developed severe pneumonia requiring immediate hospitalization but were not admitted to a hospital until just before their deaths,” he said. More than 15,000 COVID-19 patients had to stay home without access to hospital care in Osaka Prefecture at the peak of the fourth wave. In neighboring Hyogo Prefecture, of which Kobe is the capital, the number topped 1,800. Aside from those patients, 1,900 infected people in Kobe were in talks with public health officials to find hospital beds or rooms in designated hotels. The corresponding number was 3,500 in Osaka Prefecture. CRYING WITH FAMILY MEMBERS Tatsuta, 35, and a nurse visited the homes of seniors and disable people infected with the novel coronavirus between late March and late June on a program commissioned by the Kobe city government and public hospitals. He said the rooms of some patients were covered in garbage and vomit. One motionless patient groaned, “It hurts” and “I feel terrible.” Another patient repeatedly asked Tatsuta, “Am I dying?” Tatsuta and the nurse visited around 25 homes without a break from 7 a.m. to the late evening each day. After the visits, he compiled a report on each patient. But his work did not end there. He often received phone calls after midnight from at-home patients saying their condition had worsened. Some callers were terrified by what was happening to them. Workers at a public health center also called him late at night. One of his duties as a provider of home-visit nursing care is to report the health conditions of the patients to a public health center. Public health center workers are in charge of deciding which patients should be hospitalized and finding beds for them. As of April 26, 1,899 COVID-19 patients were on a waiting list for hospital beds in Kobe, including many whose blood-oxygen levels had dropped and were showing serious symptoms of pneumonia. Hospitals could not accept them because they were already flooded with patients. Some relatives of patients who were suffering at home took out their frustrations on Tatsuta. “Why can’t my husband be admitted to a hospital? You must not have reported his condition properly to the public health center,” one woman snapped at him. Tatsuta said there was little he could do to ease their anger. He just had to endure it. Even if his patients finally found a hospital for treatment, it was often too late. One doctor told Tatsuta that his patient “likely won’t last long.” In some cases, he had to tell the patients’ families that the medical facilities had no ventilators or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, expensive breathing-assisting equipment that require specially trained staff to constantly monitor the patient’s condition. Some family members sobbed after learning that their relatives could not receive the best possible treatment, even as their chances for survival were becoming slim. “I cried with families together when I started this program,” Tatsuta said. “But I had to later numb my emotions to keep doing my work.” One elderly female patient hoped to receive hospital treatment, but she gave up the idea because all of the hospital beds were filled. Although a doctor visited her home to provide some treatment, her condition rapidly worsened. She ended up in great pain and could not take medicine. She was finally admitted to a hospital but died within hours of her arrival. Tatsuta said he was aware that she would probably would not make it. All he could do was pray that she would “die peacefully.” Of the patients he visited during the fourth wave of infections, about 40 were taken to hospitals after their conditions rapidly deteriorated. Twenty-five of them died. New COVID-19 cases have fast resurged in Kobe since late July. As of Aug. 2, the number of patients recuperating at home had almost tripled to 608 over just one week. Tokyo, Osaka and other major cities have also seeing surges in new cases in recent weeks, caused largely by the highly contagious Delta variant. Tokyo and three surrounding prefectures, as well as Osaka Prefecture and Okinawa Prefecture, are currently under a state of emergency until the end of August. The government also decided on the new COVID-19 hospitalization policy on Aug. 2 to prevent a collapse in health care systems in hard-hit areas. The health ministry defines patients requiring ventilators or treatment at ICUs as “serious” cases. Patients who suffer shortness of breath and are confirmed to have pneumonia or require oxygen inhalation are categorized as “moderate” cases. Those with no respiratory symptoms other than coughing are placed in the “mild” category. Infected people with “moderate” or “mild” symptoms will be asked to recover at home under the new policy, meaning an increase in the number of COVID-19 patients outside of hospitals. “It is understandable in some respects because the number of hospital beds is limited,” Tatsuta said of the policy change. But he warned against assessing cases as “low risk” based on initial symptoms. “Even if they are considered at low risk of suffering severe illness, I have seen patients whose conditions suddenly worsened,” he said. Tatsuta called on local governments to set up a system to dispatch doctors and nurses to patients’ homes and to deliver meals and other necessities if patients are denied access to hospital treatment. DEATH CAME OUT OF NOWHERE A man in his 60s who was hospitalized for COVID-19 said he remains traumatized by the solitary death of his mother at her home after she contracted the virus. The man, who lives in Kobe, called her mobile phone around noon on April 21 from his hospital but received no answer. Although she usually immediately answered such calls, he did not suspect anything serious had happened. She had shown only minor symptoms and appeared to be faring all right. But that night, emergency responders discovered her body near her bed. A nurse had called them after the mother did not answer the doorbell. “My mother was abandoned without treatment,” the man said. His infection was confirmed on April 13. His mother tested positive on April 17. On April 20, health workers contacted him about his hospitalization after he developed a high fever, became unable to eat and vomited repeatedly. He vaguely remembered that his mother called him about his condition that night. His last words to his mother were, “I will call you back later.” The Kobe city government said officials were trying to find a hospital for her. When they called her on the morning of April 20, she showed no serious symptoms. Her temperature was between 35 and 36 degrees. She did say her appetite had decreased, but she had enough water, according to city officials. The son said he still cannot believe that she died. She was well enough to shop, visit a hospital and attend culture lessons. “Her death came out of nowhere,” he said. “It feels like a relative suddenly died in a traffic accident.” He made an impassioned plea for local governments to improve the system to cope with the pandemic. “Local authorities should build a health care system that allows as many patients as possible to be hospitalized,” he said. “They should also exhaust all measures to protect the lives of those without access to hospital care.”",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14410747

Ministry for first time names arrivals who broke virus rules,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"August 3, 2021 at 18:27 JST"," Three Japanese airline passengers who broke COVID-19 prevention rules after arriving in Japan became the first violators named publicly by the health ministry as part of its policy to discourage such behavior. The ministry on Aug. 2 posted the names of three on its website for failing to report their health conditions and other information after entering Japan as required to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus. The ministry has had many such cases, but it made the names of noncompliant entrants public for the first time because the three failed to answer phone calls from authorities and gave no justifiable reasons for doing so. Two are residents of Kumamoto and Saitama prefectures who are both in their 20s and entered Japan from South Korea on July 21. The other thirtysomething arrived from the United States the same day and lives in Tokyo. All tested negative for the virus upon arrival. Under the quarantine law, all entrants to Japan are required to self-isolate at home or other accommodation facilities for two weeks. They also need to provide information, such as their health conditions and location data, to authorities daily through an app during the period. The government also asks entrants to submit a written pledge in which they consent to the release of their names if they fail to send the required reports. In June, about 30 entrants a day had not provided the information for four consecutive days, according to the ministry.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14410001
"Retailing, food sectors forced to close outlets due to virus",['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"August 3, 2021 at 18:25 JST"," Outbreaks of cluster infections are forcing retailers and food store operators to temporarily close outlets one after another as the highly contagious Delta variant of the novel coronavirus sweeps through the country and takes its toll on staff. But the extent to which those sectors are affected by the virus remains unclear as only a fraction of companies appear willing to go to public about closures due to COVID-19 or cases of infection among staff. “If officials with public health centers conclude that customers did not face any risk of contracting the virus from infected employees, some (food stores) would not announce their cases,” said an official with a leading restaurant chain. All floors of Hanshin Department Store’s Umeda main outlet near busy Osaka Station were closed July 31 and Aug. 1 after 97 employees tested positive for the virus. The outlet partially reopened on Aug. 2, but not the food floors, where most of the infections occurred. The store operator explained that was because results of PCR tests had not come back for all of its 2,000 or so employees, including 1,500 who staff the food floors, by Aug. 1. In addition to setting up counters for customers to disinfect their hands, the store monitored the temperature of each customer on arrival and refused entry to those with a reading of 37.5 degrees or higher. Officials said they made sure that all members of staff strictly follow safety protocol by wearing face masks, regularly disinfecting their hands and having their temperatures taken. All employees are required to eat alone on their break and prohibited from chatting with colleagues unless they are wearing masks. They were also discouraged from taking business trips or attending group dinners after work. Officials fear they may have a serious case of cluster infection on their hands despite the precautionary measures in place. “Delta may be responsible for this cluster. This is scary because we don't have a clue how this happened,” said a store representative. The store now operates the outlet's air ventilation system around the clock instead of only during operating hours. Starbucks Coffee Japan had temporarily closed 21 outlets as of Aug. 2 after members of staff tested positive for the virus. The number of outlets forced to shut temporarily due to infections among employees had hovered at one or two since last spring until late July when the pandemic went up another notch. The figure is now five or so daily. Many outlets are forced to shut due staff shortages triggered by the health crisis. Starbucks Coffee Japan, in its guidelines, directs employees to stay home for two weeks if they had worked with an infected individual in the lead-up to that person displaying COVID-19 symptoms. The company said it insists on closing outlets temporarily even if a public health center considers it is not necessary. McDonald’s Japan had suspended operations at six of its outlets as of Aug. 2, citing coronavirus cases among employees. Operators of supermarket chains have a heightened sense of alarm over coronavirus virus infections among employees. A company that operates 300 or so stores in the Tokyo metropolitan area and the Kansai region said infections among its workforce had hovered at around 10 a day since late July. So far, no outlets were forced to close. “It is possible the virus was transmitted to employees by their family and other sources unrelated to their job,” a company representative said. Another company that operates a supermarket chain in Tokyo and neighboring prefectures said infections among staff began to rise in tandem with skyrocketing cases in the capital. Any outlet where an infection is confirmed is thoroughly disinfected after the store has closed for the day and staff are brought in the next day from other stores to make up for the shortfall. “To remain open is our mission as a supermarket is a lifeline,” said a company official.

‘Serious COVID cases only’ policy for hospitals draws fire,['By JUN TABUSHI/ Staff Writer'],"August 3, 2021 at 18:07 JST"," The government’s new policy of providing hospital treatment only for COVID-19 patients in serious condition or at high risk of becoming severely ill has sparked criticism that other infected people are being “abandoned.” The Suga administration decided on Aug. 2 to ask prefectures to impose the new hospitalization policy in areas with surging numbers of novel coronavirus infections to prevent the medical system from collapsing. Patients with mild or moderate symptoms are currently hospitalized, but they will be asked to recuperate at home, in principle, if they are considered at low risk of developing serious symptoms. Those with mild or no symptoms will no longer be allowed to recuperate at hotels or other accommodation facilities unless they are likely to infect family members at home. Novel coronavirus infections, led by the Delta variant, are spreading at an unprecedented speed around Japan. “The health care system is facing a greater strain, particularly in Tokyo,” Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga said at an Aug. 2 meeting with relevant Cabinet ministers, including health minister Norihisa Tamura and Yasutoshi Nishimura, the state minister of economic revitalization, who is also in charge of the government’s novel coronavirus measures. The health ministry defines patients requiring ventilators or treatment at ICUs as “serious” cases. Patients who suffer shortness of breath and are confirmed to have pneumonia or require oxygen inhalation are categorized as “moderate” cases. Those who have no respiratory symptoms other than coughing are placed in the “mild” category. In past waves of infections, a number of patients recuperating at home died after their conditions suddenly worsened. To prevent a repeat, the central government will urge local governments to strengthen monitoring of patients at their homes. It will promote online medical examinations and distribute pulse oximeters, which can measure blood oxygen levels. The government will pay an additional 9,500 yen ($87) in treatment fees to doctors if they visit patients resting at home or other accommodation facilities. Prefectural governments will decide whether their jurisdictions fall under areas with spikes in new COVID-19 cases. The health ministry said it will allow local authorities to implement the changes according to their needs. Yukio Edano, leader of the main opposition Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan, described the government’s new hospitalization policy as “unbelievable” at the party’s meeting on Aug. 3. “The government says it will ask patients (at low risk of becoming seriously ill) to recuperate at home, but that effectively means it is abandoning them,” Edano said. “The government has repeatedly assured the public that they are ‘safe and secure.’ And it suddenly says it can no longer provide hospital treatment to patients even if they have moderate symptoms. “I feel strong resentment toward this lack of crisis management.” Akira Koike, head of the Japanese Communist Party’s Secretariat, tweeted on Aug. 2 that the changes to the hospitalization policy are unacceptable because the government made the decision without convening the Diet or hearing experts’ opinions. The surge in infections has already put a heavy strain on health care systems around the country. As of Aug. 1, the occupancy rate of hospital beds set aside for COVID-19 patients was 49 percent in Tokyo, 57 percent in Saitama Prefecture and 73 percent in Okinawa Prefecture. Some local governments have adopted stricter criteria for hospitalizing COVID-19 patients. Last December, Kanagawa Prefecture introduced a new triage system based on patients’ age, underlying conditions, blood oxygen levels and other factors.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14409902
"Despite Suga’s pledge, only 75% of seniors got both jabs",['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"August 3, 2021 at 17:06 JST"," Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga was crowing only the other day that he had met his pledge made three months ago to ensure that all senior citizens aged 65 and older would be vaccinated against COVID-19 if they wanted to. It turns out he was way wrong. At a July 30 news conference, Suga said, “For senior citizens who are at greater risk of developing serious symptoms, I believe we have been able to meet our goal.” Suga announced April 23 that the government was seeking to complete giving two jabs each to older individuals by the end of July. But according to the Cabinet Secretariat website, which displays the number of people who have been inoculated, 86.2 percent of those aged 65 and older had only received one jab as of July 31 while 75.5 percent had gotten the prescribed two. Officials said the actual percentage could be slightly higher than the figures on the Cabinet Secretariat website because the numbers are based on entries into the government’s vaccination data base by local governments and medical institutions. Some entries may be inputted days after the fact. When asked how the government would define the completion of vaccinations for different age groups, a high-ranking official in the prime minister’s office snapped, “When we stop receiving new reservations for vaccinations.” But a large number of senior citizens still have reservations for jabs in August, so it remains unclear when the process will be completed. Vaccinations of senior citizens began on April 12. Another milestone Suga set--1 million jabs a day--was reached by the end of June, but the haste to set up vaccination programs at workplaces and universities led to shortages of vaccines around the nation, forcing many local governments to stop accepting reservations as they were unsure how many doses they would have on hand. The more virulent Delta strain, which is now predominant, is cited as the primary cause of the recent surge in COVID-19 cases around Japan. With more patients in their 40s and 50s developing serious symptoms, Suga set a new goal of having 40 percent of the entire population receiving two vaccine doses by late August. Taro Kono, the state minister in charge of administrative reform who also is coordinating the vaccination program within the central government, is expected this week to announce the delivery schedule for vaccines in September. That will give local governments a better grasp of how many reservations they can take. However, the process of vaccinating the entire Japanese population is still at a crawl compared with other advanced nations. As of Aug. 1, officials said 34.5 percent of all Japanese had received one jab, while only about 24.6 percent had gotten the full two doses.

In Tokyo, for the first time, the daily count of new cases reached the 4,000 mark on July 31. Record case numbers were confirmed in at least seven prefectures: Saitama, Kanagawa and Chiba, which are all adjacent to Tokyo, as well as Gunma, Tochigi, Kyoto and Okinawa. In Saitama Prefecture, the daily tally of new COVID-19 cases exceeded 1,000 for the first time with 1,036. The previous record for Saitama, 869, was logged July 28.

Olympic ‘watch parties’ turn Tokyo parks into booze fests,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"July 31, 2021 at 18:22 JST"," Millions of people in Tokyo are staying home glued to their TVs to watch the Olympics, but plenty of others are partying away in parks each night, swigging cans of booze as they cheer the latest medal tallies by Japanese athletes. This is the reality of the expanded state of emergency declared by the government as COVID-19 cases continue to skyrocket. Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga insists that his unpopular decision to go ahead with the Olympics at the height of the pandemic has nothing to do with the surge in new infections. Rather, the Games are helping to contain the health crisis, Suga and his aides contend. Yasutoshi Nishimura, the state minister heading the government's efforts to grapple with the health crisis, stated, “We face an extremely tough situation as infections are spreading widely” while addressing a Lower House committee meeting July 30 on the latest COVID-19 surge. The number of new cases nationwide hit a record 10,743 that day. But in the same breath, Nishimura said, “As many people watch the Olympics at home, the movement of people has slowed down since July 20.” He also noted that TV ratings for Olympic-related programs “remain high, which is an indication that many people are staying home and watching the Games.” Suga held a news conference that evening to announce that the emergency curbs are being extended until the end of August and expanded to cover the four prefectures of Chiba, Saitama, Kanagawa and Osaka. He reiterated that his government is doing everything it can to bring the crisis under control while the Olympics are being staged. He mentioned efforts to regulate traffic and exhortations to companies to allow employees to telework as much as possible. Suga said these efforts are in fact paying off in terms of reducing the number of people going out in nightlife districts in Tokyo. But in reality, parks in central Tokyo are packed every night with youngsters and others holding “Olympics watch parties” with friends while downing cans of alcohol purchased at convenience stores. Bars and restaurants around trendy JR Harajuku Station in the capital's Shibuya Ward have been complying with metropolitan government requests since emergency curbs were re-imposed July 12 to turn off their lights at 8 p.m. Spacious Yoyogi Park is nearby, and it immediately became a magnet for people to gather after dark with plastic bags packed with food, snacks and drinks purchased at convenience stores. The park initially was intended to be one of the capital's official public viewing sites for the Tokyo Olympics. But that idea was scrapped in early June due to the pandemic. On the evening of July 30, when Japan’s gold medal count hit an all-time Olympic record of 17, hordes of young people occupied spaces in the popular park. Signs erected all over the park say, “Please refrain from drinking alcohol.” Loads of youngsters paid no attention, many sitting right next to the signs, chatting, drinking and laughing away. A man in his 20s came to the park with a friend from his university days to drink. He said he was well aware of the spike in COVID-19 cases but it did not matter because “the park is well ventilated.” The IT company he works for maintains a teleworking policy for its employees. As a result, the man said he had not been to a drinking party for more than a year. This occasion was extra special because it was the first time for the two friends to “have drinks together face to face.” So special that he purchased sushi to share that cost 10,000 yen ($91). In another corner at the park, a 30-year-old woman downed wine with three coworkers. They sat on a tarp as one of them held up a smartphone to watch Olympic events together. “We wanted to get a feel of a public viewing party,” the woman said. Still, it was rather a subdued one. “I really wish we could do whoops and high-fives,” she lamented. Another “watch party” was going on at Miyashita Park near JR Shibuya Station the same evening. By 9:20 p.m., approximately 350 people had packed the park, which is situated on the rooftop of a commercial facility. All of the benches set up in the park were occupied. Young women were busy talking about their latest romances. Non-Japanese sat in a circle and partied away. Many of the participants that evening did not bother to wear masks. Two university students, aged 20 and 21, arrived at the park after a meal at an “izakaya” restaurant. They sat on the ground and watched an Olympic fencing event on a smartphone. When the Japanese team won a gold medal, they screamed, “A medal!! On streets near the park, young skateboarders were honing their skills. A 21-year-old man, holding his board, said the Olympics “are hot!” He mentioned Yuto Horigome, the Japanese skateboarder who won skateboarding’s first Olympic gold on July 25. “He is on a way different level!” the man said in awe.

"COVID-19 likely to see ‘explosive’ growth in Tokyo, experts warn",['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"July 30, 2021 at 18:19 JST"," Tokyo’s daily average of new COVID-19 cases over the week through Aug. 11 could see an “unprecedentedly explosive” growth, hitting 4,532, experts warned on July 29. The estimated figure was presented that day at a meeting of the Tokyo metropolitan government’s expert panel monitoring the spread of the novel coronavirus in the capital. Experts at the meeting called for a need to quickly respond to the situation to prevent infections from continuing to increase at the current pace. They also said the number of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 has doubled over the month, already placing a heavy strain on the health care system. The capital’s daily average of new infection cases over the week through July 28 was 1,936, up 1.53 times from the 1,268 recorded a week earlier, according to data shared at the meeting. Norio Omagari, director of the Disease Control and Prevention Center under the National Center for Global Health and Medicine, estimated that the figure will reach 2,962 on Aug. 4 and 4,532 on Aug. 11 if infections keep rising at the current pace. “That will put the health care system at risk of collapse, so we must act quickly to avert it (the scenario),” he said. The panel also reported that the highly contagious Delta variant was responsible for 46.3 percent of new infections confirmed by diagnostic tests conducted in Tokyo over the week through July 18. The figure was up from 30.6 percent a week earlier. “Tokyo will face an explosive growth in infections if it fails to sufficiently reduce the flow of people and allows infections from the Delta variant to further replace those from other strains of the virus,” Omagari said. Data presented at the meeting also showed that 3,039 people were hospitalized with COVID-19 in the capital as of July 29, double the figure from a month ago. The panel also noted that the metropolitan government received 270 requests a day from local public health centers over the week through July 28 to find hospitals that could take in COVID-19 patients. The figure jumped from the 184 recorded a week earlier. Officials had difficulty arranging hospitalizations, particularly during the four-day holiday weekend that ended on July 25, forcing many patients to wait at home, according to Masataka Inokuchi, vice chair of the Tokyo Medical Association. He said the situation has remained the same even after the weekend and that it will likely become even more difficult for officials to make arrangements for patients’ hospitalizations.

"IOC, athletes complain about ‘terrible’ bus operations",['By KOGO SHIOYA/ Staff Writer'],"July 30, 2021 at 17:10 JST"," Tokyo Olympic organizers have been hit with complaints that confusion in bus operations for the Games has caused a host of problems, including athletes forced to miss training time, sources said July 29. “We are asking the Tokyo organizing committee to do better,” an official of the International Olympic Committee said. “It’s a terrible situation.” The bus operations were set up to transport athletes from the Olympic Village to training and competition venues. IOC officials said some buses did not show up to pick up the athletes as scheduled or went to the wrong destinations. According to sources, one competitor missed a training session because a bus was delayed. In another case, a bus did not arrive on time, so an athlete took a taxi to the training venue, even though such cab use could violate protocols of the COVID-19-prevention “bubble.” Many bus drivers were brought in from outside the capital to work at the Olympic Games. Tokyo organizing committee officials said such drivers may be unfamiliar with roads in the city. In addition, the committee cited botched operations in arranging an appropriate number of buses for peak times of the athletes’ movements. According to sources, IOC officials strongly demanded the Tokyo committee improve the transportation system during a meeting on July 27. “The organizing committee should stick to the athletes’ schedules, not its own,” an IOC official said. The IOC is asking for improved operations, additional parking spaces, and more staff and professional drivers. “It is getting better,” a public relations official of the Tokyo organizing committee said on July 29.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14407099
Young people told to get shots that are largely unavailable,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"July 30, 2021 at 15:30 JST"," Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike’s calls for young people to get vaccinated against COVID-19 have exacerbated frustrations over the shortages of doses in the capital. Tokyo keeps setting daily records for the number of newly confirmed infections, and a growing percentage of the new patients are in the younger age groups. Koike has been urging young people to help stem the increase by getting vaccinated. A 34-year-old company employee in Kokubunji, western Tokyo, was flabbergasted by Koike’s remarks. He said he would surely comply, if he could. “To say ‘get vaccinated’ when there are no vaccines available shows that she has no understanding of the situation at the local level,” the man said. The Kokubunji city government has been inoculating its residents from the oldest age groups, and it has not yet gotten around to vaccinating those 39 and younger. A 27-year-old employee residing in Tokyo’s Setagaya Ward agreed with the message that Koike was trying to get across, but the lack of vaccines has made fulfilling her request difficult. He received a vaccine voucher from the ward government about 10 days ago, but reservations have already been filled. Of the record 3,865 COVID-19 cases reported in Tokyo on July 29, 36.7 percent were patients in their 20s and 20.2 percent were in their 30s. A 28-year-old company employee living in Meguro Ward has already been told by his family living in Saitama Prefecture not to bother returning to the family home for the Bon holidays in August. However, the man is one of the lucky ones. He made a reservation for a vaccine shot in early August through his workplace. Moreover, his wife also received a vaccine ticket for spouses from her workplace, so technically the man can get four doses. The situation made the man think that “vaccines are not going to where they are needed.” Given the increase in younger people being infected, local governments in Tokyo have switched to inoculating residents in lower age groups, but the lack of vaccines has hampered their efforts. For example, the Shinjuku Ward government has placed priority on getting residents in their 20s and 30s vaccinated, and it began taking reservations on July 7. But with not enough doses to go around, only 14 percent of residents in those two age groups had received their first dose as of July 27. The ward government is still seeking to inoculate all residents by the end of November. “We will not reach that goal at the current rate, but there is nothing we can do since there are no vaccines” said one official handling vaccinations in the ward. The Suginami Ward government has implemented a similar measure for its residents aged between 12 and 39. But of the 180,000 or so in that age bracket, only about 95,000 have been jabbed so far. Reservations for the 170,000 or so Suginami residents between 40 and 59 began on July 14, but with only enough doses for 20,000 residents, all available slots were filled in about two hours. The Setagaya Ward government, also facing a major shortage of vaccines, has turned to the Rakuten Inc. group, which is headquartered in the ward, for a cooperative effort. Rakuten has started a vaccination program for its employees, and under the new arrangement, Setagaya residents 18 and older can also get their shots there. However, the program will still not completely cover the shortage of vaccines. Setagaya Mayor Nobuto Hosaka said he hoped the Tokyo metropolitan government would make greater efforts to negotiate with the central government for more doses.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14407036
COVID-19 state of emergency to run until Aug. 31 in 6 prefectures,['By DAI NAGATA/ Staff Writer'],"July 30, 2021 at 14:10 JST"," The government on July 30 decided to place Saitama, Chiba, Kanagawa and Osaka prefectures under a state of emergency from Aug. 2 to Aug. 31 following the record-setting spread of the novel coronavirus.

Tokyo sukiyaki restaurant open over 140 years to shut due to virus,['By YUKI KASHIWAGI/ Staff Writer'],"July 30, 2021 at 08:00 JST"," The boisterous conversations are coming to an end at a sukiyaki restaurant with a 140-plus-year history in Tokyo’s Asakusa district, which will shut its doors after a plunge in business its owner blames on the COVID-19 pandemic. “Sukiyaki essentially shortens the distance between eaters to put them closer to one another,” said Fumihiko Sumiyoshi, 55, the sixth-generation manager of the Chin-ya sukiyaki shop. “But what makes sukiyaki appealing worked against it in the coronavirus crisis.” Chin-ya, located along a street facing the iconic Kaminarimon gate at Sensoji temple since the early Meiji Era (1868-1912), is set to shut on Aug. 15. The operators of the long-running established restaurant, which prided itself on bringing people closer through its communal dish served in a pot, say the decision to close was clinched by the government's COVID-19 policy that warns citizens to avoid the “three Cs” of closed, crowded and close-contact settings. Though the restaurant boasted a nostalgic ambiance, it had fallen too far behind the times. Plummeting customer numbers during the pandemic, however, ended up nixing the plan to refurbish the eatery. Its name, Chin-ya, comes from the building's use during the Edo Period (1603-1867) as a veterinary clinic that delivered Japanese spaniels, called ""chin,"" and other pets to daimyo feudal lords and wealthy merchants. The name stuck even after the building turned into a restaurant in 1880. Following the Meiji Restoration in 1868 that brought down the Tokugawa Shogunate and restored imperial rule, Fukuzawa Yukichi (1835-1901) and other cultural figures frequented beef pot restaurants. Beef pot became a fashionable food, and Tokyo is said to have been home to nearly 500 beef pot stores in 1877, situated mainly in Asakusa. The meal’s Kansai-style name, sukiyaki, later spread, and Chin-ya in 1903 started exclusively providing it. Many ukiyo-e paintings depicting cultural items connected to Japan’s Westernization still remain on display inside Chin-ya. SERVING THREE GENERATIONS Sumiyoshi, who became Chin-ya’s manager in 2001, had a prime spot to assess how customers reacted to the restaurant: He has spent long periods at its entrance collecting their shoes after they took them off to go inside. “I met customers as they arrived and were going home, so I could tell how happy they were by how they left,” he said. While people typically eat sukiyaki to celebrate special occasions, many also come to Chin-ya after memorial services, grave visits and other Buddhist rituals since there are many temples around Asakusa. Sumiyoshi carefully arranged details of the restaurant to create “lasting memories” for families and friends who dined there. His efforts paid off. Sumiyoshi recounted seeing regulars who had frequented Chin-ya over three generations pop in for a bite with relatives from the next generation in tow, who said they had come to eat at “the place our grandpa loved.” Another group of customers used to get together in front of the restaurant and enjoy sukiyaki every Jan. 3 without making a reservation. They were former colleagues at a company that had located in the neighborhood, he said. But the group thinned out year after year. Several years ago, only a single person showed up and they didn't order sukiyaki, saying, “Eating it by myself would just make me feel lonely.” “I should have made more effort to talk the customer into eating with us,” regretted Sumiyoshi, recalling the retreating figure. In 2008, Sumiyoshi began organizing a conference bringing together more than 50 sukiyaki restaurant operators from across the nation. There had been no sukiyaki business associations, so for many it was the first time to meet another operator of a sukiyaki restaurant. The event has since been happening several occasions a year with different shops holding it in rotation. “The gathering is very exciting as we aggressively discuss topics like a certain Welsh onion,” said Sumiyoshi, jokingly, adding, “This, however, must generate a considerable amount of carbon dioxide and droplets of saliva.” HOPES FOR A REBOOT The current restaurant's building was constructed in 1975. Its wooden frames have warped so badly now that its windows won't open. On hot days, the overheated air conditioning system stops. With no end to troubles like these, the arrival of the coronavirus pandemic ended up dealing the final blow to Chin-ya. “Right now, restaurants themselves are seen as evil,” Sumiyoshi lamented. “When you eat sukiyaki, people sit with their knees close to one another so all of them can reach the pot. You eat while talking energetically. 'Oh, this has not boiled well,’ someone says, or ‘This looks nice.’ ""Sukiyaki makes for a pleasant meal as it brings people closer mentally and toward the end of it people are more friendly."" But Sumiyoshi made up his mind to shut down the restaurant and sell the building and in late June he mailed a “notification of closure” letter to regulars of the eatery. Since then, he has received a flood of inquires. Though Chin-ya will close, its managing firm will be kept operational, with the possibility of reviving and restarting the restaurant in some form someday. “I'm not giving up,"" said Sumiyoshi. ""I'm looking forward to that day."" In the meantime, he added, he would be singing Kyu Sakamoto's 1960s hit song ""Sukiyaki.""",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14395929

It topped the previous day’s 3,177 cases, marking its third consecutive day of smashing that record. It was also a record-making day for the organizers of the Tokyo Olympics. The Organizing Committee of Tokyo Olympic and Paralympic Games confirmed that 24 accredited people tested positive for the novel coronavirus, the highest since the committee started announcing a daily count of infection cases. Three of the 24 are athletes, while 15 are contractors, the committee said. Seven of them are people related to the Games and came from abroad. Seventeen are those who live in Japan, according to the committee. A total of 193 people related to the Games have contracted the virus. According to Tokyo metropolitan government officials, the seven-day average of new cases in the capital reached a record high of 2,224.1 on July 29, up 61.9 percent from the figure a week ago. The previous high was 1,954.7, which was recorded the day before. Among the 3,865 new cases, 1,417 were in their 20s, followed by 782 in their 30s, 612 in their 40s, and 407 in their 50s.

"Japan’s infection count tops 9,000 for first time; 3,177 in Tokyo",['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"July 28, 2021 at 19:05 JST"," The number of new COVID-19 cases in Japan on July 28 surpassed 9,000 for the first time, with Tokyo adding a record high 3,177 infections to the total, government officials said. The highly contagious Delta variant of the novel coronavirus has led not only to record infection figures in the Tokyo metropolitan area but is apparently also spreading elsewhere around the nation. Just the previous day in the capital, 2,848 new infections were confirmed, smashing the earlier record of 2,520 set on Jan. 7. The total on July 28 not only set another high, but it was also the first time for the figure to exceed 3,000, metropolitan government officials said. N eighboring Kanagawa, Saitama and Chiba prefectures also reported record numbers of new infections, with 1,051, 870 and 577, respectively. On reason for the surge is that more people have been tested for the novel coronavirus this week. Most medical institutions were closed between July 22 and July 25 because two holidays were added to the weekend for the opening of the Tokyo Olympics. Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike said on July 28 that the virus is spreading fast among young people, and some of them have developed serious symptoms. In contrast, the number of infected people aged 65 or older has declined, she said, apparently because they received priority in the vaccination program. “Please ensure that you stay home unless you have something absolutely necessary to do outside, and thoroughly follow COVID-19 safety protocols,” she said. The governor also called on young people to get vaccinated. In Hokkaido, 227 people were newly confirmed infected. It was the first time in about two months for the number on the northern main island to exceed 200. Ishikawa Prefecture in central Japan also posted a high of 119 new infections. In Osaka Prefecture, the infection tally reached 798, topping 700 for two straight days. Okinawa Prefecture confirmed 347 new COVID-19 cases, the second consecutive day for the figure to exceed 300 in the southern island prefecture. According to Tokyo metropolitan government officials, the seven-day average of new cases in the capital reached a record high of 1,954.7 on July 28, up 53 percent from the figure a week ago. The previous high was 1,861.1, which was recorded on Jan. 11 in the third wave of infections. The seven-day average was 523.1 on July 1, but it has since shot up, topping 1,000 on July 17 and 1,500 on July 26. These figures indicate that Tokyo is now in the grip of the largest wave of infections so far at a time when the once-delayed Olympics are well under way in the capital. Chief Cabinet Secretary Katsunobu Kato on July 28 did not give a direct answer when asked by a reporter if Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga still believes that staging the Summer Games in the current virus situation is not problematic. Suga had earlier ruled out the possibility of canceling the Games despite the increase in infections in Tokyo. The reporter referred to Suga’s remark at a June 7 Diet session that his decision on whether to hold the Olympics will be made on the premise of protecting people’s health and lives as a top priority. “The central government has imposed various safety measures,” Kato said. “There has been a decline, albeit slow, in the number of people staying out at night, compared with the last state of emergency.” He also said the central government is not aware of any reports of Olympians or officials having developed serious symptoms after being infected.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14405353
Backlash forces government to retract 10% cut in vaccine supply,['By JUNYA SAKAMOTO/ Staff Writer'],"July 28, 2021 at 18:15 JST"," The central government is backtracking on a planned reduction in the supply of Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine to local governments with excess stock after the municipalities pushed back. Taro Kono, the administrative reform minister who is in charge of the COVID-19 vaccine rollout, said on July 27 that the government decided it would not cut the supply of the vaccine, jointly developed by U.S. pharmaceutical company Pfizer Inc. and its German partner, BioNTech, for the latter half of August. Osaka, Nagoya and other municipalities targeted for the cut in Pfizer shipments for the first half of August had bristled over the cutback and called on the central government to reconsider. Kono said he heard from municipalities that they cannot predict how many vaccine doses will be delivered if the central government reduces the supply at the last minute. “A drop in the base supply could force municipalities to give up on allocating the doses to some of the places they planned to,” he said. The central government had previously said it would ship about 11.7 million doses of the Pfizer vaccine every two weeks in August and September, and distribute 80 percent of the doses as a “base supply” to prefectural governments in proportion to their populations. The government subsequently decided to cut Pfizer shipments by 10 percent for local governments with more than six weeks’ worth of excess stock to deal with a supply crunch. Kono said on July 7 that the reduction in vaccine supply would start with the shipment for the first half of August. But he announced at a news conference on July 21 that the central government would leave all the decisions on allocating the Pfizer doses to municipalities up to prefectural governments from September onward. The central government moved the schedule forward by announcing it would effectively retract the planned cut in vaccine shipments for the latter half of August. Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga asked Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla to provide some of the 20 million doses of the vaccine to Japan in October and November ahead of schedule during their meeting on July 23, according to an official close to the prime minister. Kono also revealed the National Governors’ Association on July 27 reported the inoculation program for health care workers, who have been vaccinated as a top priority group since mid-February, has been completed. “All prefectures had finished inoculating health care workers by July 23,” he said.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14405207
Conflicting views given on whether Tokyo is nearing a COVID-19 crisis,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"July 28, 2021 at 15:45 JST"," Government officials and health experts differed on the severity of the recent surge in COVID-19 cases in Tokyo and the possible effects on medical care facilities in the capital. Tokyo reported a record high 2,848 new COVID-19 cases on July 27, continuing the trend of rising numbers under the latest state of emergency. “If this pace continues, normal medical care will be endangered,” said Mitsuru Honda, chairman of the Emergency Medical Care Center at the Toho University Omori Medical Center in the capital’s Ota Ward. He added that while the number of new COVID-19 cases was lower during the four-day weekend from July 22, “the rate at which hospital beds for such patients were being filled shot up sharply.” The medical center has set aside six beds for COVID-19 patients with serious symptoms and 25 for those with mid-level symptoms. By the four-day weekend, five of the beds for seriously ill patients and at least 20 for those with mid-level symptoms had been filled. For Tokyo as a whole, 58 percent of hospital beds for patients with serious symptoms were occupied as of July 26. The number of new cases over the course of a week is at about the same level as the peak figure for the third wave of infections this past winter. But at that time, about 80 percent of hospital beds for COVID-19 patients were filled, while the figure now is about 40 percent. The major reasons for that improvement are the increase in hospital beds capable of taking in such patients as well as the larger number of senior citizens who have been vaccinated. Norihiko Yoshimura, the head of the Tokyo metropolitan government’s Bureau of Social Welfare and Public Health, met with reporters on July 27 and tried to quell concerns about a possible crisis in the medical care system. He explained that the situation now is vastly different from the third wave when about 14 percent of new cases in Tokyo were people 60 and older, the age group at the highest risk of developing severe symptoms. That rate had dropped to 5 percent as of July 27. Yoshimura called on reporters not to needlessly enflame concerns about a crisis. He said about 70 percent of the new cases now were of people under 40 who were at less risk of developing serious symptoms. But there are troubling signs. Shortly after a state of emergency began on Jan. 8, a day after the peak for infections during the third wave, the number of new COVID-19 cases in Tokyo began declining. The latest state of emergency has now been in place for two weeks, and the daily infection figures are not decreasing but rising sharply. Some health experts pointed to the higher pedestrian traffic in major Tokyo entertainment areas as a worrying sign that the increases would continue. “The current level of those milling around at entertainment areas makes it difficult to forecast when the infection spread will be brought under control,” said Atsushi Nishida, head of the Research Center for Social Science and Medicine at the Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Medical Science, which has been conducting studies on pedestrian traffic in the capital. Nishida said a further decline in pedestrian traffic would be needed to lower the number of new cases, given that the highly contagious Delta variant is now having a larger impact. The Tokyo metropolitan government’s definition of COVID-19 patients with serious symptoms also clouds the picture of the medical care structure. Only patients using ventilators and other assisted-breathing equipment are defined as having serious symptoms. Under that definition, Tokyo had 82 COVID-19 patients in serious condition as of July27. But the health ministry also includes patients treated in intensive care units as having serious symptoms. If the ministry’s definition is used, Tokyo had 676 seriously ill COVID-19 patients as of July 25.

Tokyo’s neighbors seek COVID-19 state of emergency,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"July 28, 2021 at 13:20 JST"," Chiba, Saitama and Kanagawa, three prefectures neighboring Tokyo, plan to ask the central government to place them under a state of emergency to stem the sharp rise in COVID-19 cases, sources said. Chiba Governor Toshihito Kumagai said his request could come as early as July 28. “Considering the latest infection situation in my prefecture, I decided to proceed to make the request,” Kumagai said on July 27. The three prefectures are currently administering pre-emergency measures, but novel coronavirus infections continue to spread. Japan confirmed 7,629 new COVID-19 cases on July 27, the fourth highest figure. Tokyo, which is already under a state of emergency while it hosts the Summer Olympics, reported 2,848 new cases on July 27, shattering the previous daily high of 2,520 set on Jan. 7 during the third wave of infections. Chiba Prefecture set a record with 509 new cases on July 26, and reported 405 on the following day. Saitama also reported a record 593 new cases on July 27 while Kanagawa Prefecture confirmed 758 new cases on the same day. Osaka Prefecture logged 741 new cases while Okinawa Prefecture’s 354 confirmed infections eclipsed its previous record of 335 set on May 29. Fukuoka Prefecture reported 236 new cases, topping 200 for the first time since May 26. Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga held a meeting with health minister Norihisa Tamura and other Cabinet ministers on July 27 to discuss anti-virus measures. One minister suggested that the state of emergency be expanded to cover Chiba, Saitama and Kanagawa prefectures, as well as Osaka Prefecture, a source said. Although COVID-19 has been spreading rapidly across the nation, including an increasing number of cases involving the highly contagious Delta variant, Suga ruled out the possibility of canceling the Tokyo Olympics. When asked by reporters about the risk of continuing the world’s bigge st sporting event during an increase in infections, Suga said, “Due to teleworking and restrictions on cars, foot traffic is decreasing, so we don’t need to be worried.”",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14405073

"Tokyo logs 2,848 new COVID-19 cases, record for a single day",['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"July 27, 2021 at 19:02 JST"," Tokyo logged a record 2,848 new novel coronavirus cases on July 27, topping the previous high of 2,520 recorded on Jan. 7, as the more contagious Delta variant is driving the latest surge, metropolitan health officials said. New cases topped 2,000 in the capital for the first time since Jan. 15, when 2,044 were registered. It was the eighth consecutive day that daily new cases in Tokyo topped 1,000. A total of 1,461 more new cases were reported on the day than the same day a week ago. The rolling seven-day average for new infections through July 27 was 1,762.6, an increase of 49.4 percent from the figure for the preceding week. In July, it has become clear that a fifth wave of COVID-19 cases has hit the capital. Tokyo reported 1,149 new cases on July 14, the first time for the daily count to go above 1,000 in about two months. Almost every day since has seen more than 1,000 new cases reported. On July 22, the number hit 1,979, the fifth most to date. On July 26, after the four consecutive holidays arranged for the Tokyo Games, new cases totaled 1,429, the most for any Monday. The seven-day positivity rate was 14.5 percent on July 25, tying the record set on Jan. 7 in the middle of the third wave of infections. Preliminary figures released by the metropolitan government showed that the Delta variant accounted for 30.5 percent of the total of new cases reported over the week through July 11. As Tokyo has been placed under a fourth state of emergency, crowds in its entertainment districts are thinning somewhat, metropolitan officials said. But the pace of infections is expected to accelerate in the coming weeks. Shigeru Omi, chief of the government’s expert panel on response to the coronavirus, has warned that the number of daily new cases could hit nearly 3,000 during the first week of August. Health experts fear that hospitals in Tokyo will likely be overwhelmed by patients with COVID-19 in the coming days. The number of serious cases requiring ventilators and other special breathing apparatus stood at 82 as of July 27, compared with 37 a month ago. The number of patients hospitalized due to the virus in Tokyo totaled 2,717 as of July 26, 1,290 more than a month ago.

"Lacking doses, hospital feels punished for pushing vaccines",['By NOBUYA SAWA/ Senior Staff Writer'],"July 26, 2021 at 18:46 JST"," KAMAGAYA, Chiba Prefecture--The response to a hospital’s request for four boxes of COVID-19 vaccine doses drew incredulous looks from everyone aware of the situation there. Central government records showed that the hospital surely must have a surplus of doses, so just one box would be provided, they were told. Lacking a sufficient supply, Toho Kamagaya Hospital was forced to suspend the first-shot part of its vaccine program. The problem with the supply chain facing Toho Kamagaya Hospital and other medical facilities around Japan stems largely from another shortage: tablet computers and personnel to register data for each vaccination. The central government’s vaccine supply plans are based largely on data entered through the tablets for the centralized Vaccination Record System (VRS), which is supposed to keep tabs on individual vaccinations and personal information in real time. But many medical facilities have complained that the cumbersome and often complicated VRS data entry process has made the information in the system out of date. The central government, for example, says its VRS data on the distribution of Pfizer vaccines showed that enough doses have been shipped to local governments in Chiba Prefecture, making shortages unlikely. However, the Chiba prefectural government contacted about 700 medical institutions in its jurisdiction on June 24 and asked if they had extra unused doses on hand. Most of the facilities said “no.” Toho Kamagaya, a core hospital in this city of 110,000 people, began giving jabs to seniors in May at the request of a local association of doctors. Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga was pushing for the immunization of all people 65 or older in Japan by the end of July. In June, the hospital provided vaccinations six days a week, and administered more than 2,000 doses a week. The hospital asked for the four boxes in June so that it would have a sufficient number of doses for the period from July 5 to July 18. The Kamagaya city government, which is in charge of distributing vaccines to medical institutions on behalf of the central government, told hospital officials it could supply only one box. Lacking supplies, Toho Kamagaya Hospital had to stop accepting reservations for first shots for residents from July 12. It decided to use its remaining Pfizer doses for second shots, which are usually given three weeks after the first one. “If the central government cannot guarantee supplies, we have a responsibility to secure the second doses,” Hideki Kanai, director of the hospital, said. “The central government is completely mistaken when it says medical institutions are accumulating doses.” TIME-CONSUMING DATA ENTRY The central government distributes a single tablet computer to each medical institution for the VRS system. The tablet scans small 18-digit numbers on the vaccination vouchers to register data. The manual for the tablet states that the device must be about 7.5 centimeters away from the numbers to scan. But maneuvering the tablet to focus on the numbers has proved laborious. A worker assigned to the task at the hospital said that on some days she scanned the numbers for eight nonstop hours. Since only one tablet was provided to each medical institution, only one person at a time can do the scanning. The hospital administered up to 1,200 jabs a day. If it took one minute to register the data for one injection, the tablet user would need 20 hours to complete the task, making it impossible to enter all of the information on the day the shots were given. At one time, data on vaccinations for more than 1,000 people were left unprocessed for several days after the doses were given, according to hospital officials. For that period, the VRS system would show the hospital still had more than 1,000 unused doses. Taro Kono, the administrative reform minister who is in charge of the vaccine rollout, announced that vaccine supplies would be curtailed from July for medical institutions that are slow in registering VRS data. Since then, officials at Toho Kamagaya Hospital have scrambled to arrange for part-time workers to spend all day entering data, rather than half a day, to prevent the hospital from lagging behind in data registration. Hospital staff are also expected to do the paperwork for expense claims for administering shots to the central government at the end of this month. “The amount of preparation for the vaccination program and related paperwork tasks is extraordinary,” Hisako Kawajiri, deputy director of the hospital, said. “The more we vaccinate, the more our workload increases. “Despite all that, we have cooperated with the vaccination campaign. But the central government has now cut vaccines supplies and is blaming medical institutions for the limited supplies. I cannot accept the way it has handled things.”",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14403434

OLYMPICS/ Positive COVID-19 test dashes Chilean athlete’s Olympic dreams,['By YU KAMATA/ Staff Writer'],"July 26, 2021 at 18:28 JST"," Chile’s Fernanda Aguirre wished it was all just a bad dream as she watched the Olympic taekwondo matches she was supposed to compete in had she not tested positive for the novel coronavirus. Aguirre, 23, had entered the taekwondo 57-kilogram weight division, but just days ago became the first athlete to withdraw from a competition at the Tokyo Games because of COVID-19. She is currently isolating in a hotel room overlooking the streets of Tokyo. On July 25, when her competition was originally scheduled, she was sitting on a bed, watching a livestream of her rival athletes’ matches online. “It’s painful when I imagine myself competing with them,” Aguirre said in an online interview with The Asahi Shimbun. She arrived in Japan on July 19 and took a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test and an antigen test at the airport, according to the rules set out in the Olympic “playbook” for the Tokyo Games. The result came back positive. Aguirre said she has no idea how or where she contracted the virus. She received her second COVID-19 vaccine shot in April. None of her fellow athletes or her trainers tested positive. She also tested negative in all three PCR tests she took before entering Japan. She currently has no symptoms of COVID-19, nor does she feel ill. But the Chilean Olympic Committee decided that Aguirre would withdraw from the Olympics because she could not participate in the July 25 competition, given the requisite 10-day quarantine period. “The decision threw me into despair,” she said. “I couldn’t stop crying. It was my dream to compete in the Olympics. I spent years preparing for the Games. But all of them came to nothing in an instant.” Aguirre took up taekwondo when she was 8. She said it gave her “peace of mind” as a young tomboy, and that the sense of achievement she had when she earned points at matches motivated her to continue in the sport. Her family also supported her. Her father cheered her on by saying, “You’re the champion.” Her mother made her healthy meals, while her grandmother woke her up every day as she had trouble getting up on time. As a result of her hard work and support from her family, Aguirre landed in the top ranks of a 2019 competition in Central and South America, qualifying her for the Tokyo Olympics. Even after the Games were pushed back a year due to the pandemic, she remained positive, thinking she would be able to spend more time training. She devoted herself to practicing with her coach at a local university. Her tight stomach muscles are a testament to her hard work. “Everything turned upside down,” Aguirre said, wiping her tears away with a towel. She is now confined to a hotel room with two single beds, except for fetching meals at a designated place in the hotel. “I eat exactly the same thing three times a day: rice, noodles and salmon,” she said in a tired voice. Aguirre added that she spends time doing sit-ups and squats in the tiny room, and she uses a translation device when communicating with a nurse who checks on her over the phone. She said her only emotional support is messages of encouragement from her family and friends. She also said she congratulated a Costa Rican athlete on social media who qualified for the Games in place of her. Aguirre will turn 24 on July 29. She would have been enjoying her time in Tokyo as an Olympic athlete. But now, she has no idea when her quarantine will end. “Right now, I just want to go home as quickly as possible,” she said. “I miss my family.”",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14403500
Application process starts for Japan’s ‘vaccine passports’,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"July 26, 2021 at 16:54 JST"," Municipalities across Japan on July 26 started accepting applications for “vaccine passports” from people who are fully inoculated against COVID-19 and hope to travel overseas. In general, applicants need to apply at service windows at the municipal government office that issued their vaccination vouchers. Some offices are only accepting applications sent through mail. Vaccination vouchers, vaccination records of the two shots and passports must be included in the applications. The vaccine certificate is an A4-size sheet of paper showing the person’s name, type of vaccine used and the dates of the inoculations. It will be issued free of charge. The idea is that the certificates will exempt travelers from Japan from quarantine and other anti-virus measures after their arrivals in overseas destinations. However, the Japanese government is still not making such exemptions for people who enter Japan with vaccine passports issued by other nations. So far, five countries--Italy, Turkey, Austria, Bulgaria and Poland--have agreed to exempt arriving travelers with the Japanese vaccine certificate from some of their infection-prevention requirements. Italy, for example, will not require such arrivals to remain isolated for 10 days, while Turkey will not require them to submit a certificate of a negative PCR test. In South Korea, the Japanese vaccine passport will be accepted as one of the necessary documents to be exempt from quarantine. Estonia also recognizes the Japanese certificate, but quarantine measures there are not required for travelers, regardless of their vaccination status.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14403429

The latest figure was up 671 from a week ago and marked the 33rd consecutive day for the daily count of new infections in Tokyo to exceed that of the previous week. The latest tally brought the daily average of new infection cases in the capital over the week through July 22 to 1,373.4, or 155.7 percent of the figure for the preceding week. The number of new infections is expected to increase further in Tokyo and could exceed the all-time high of 2,520, logged on Jan. 7. Shigeru Omi, who heads the government’s expert panel on the COVID-19 pandemic, has recently estimated that the figure will reach nearly 3,000 in the first week of August. The number of serious cases in the capital requiring ventilators or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, also known as an ECMO lung bypass machine, stood at 65 as of July 22. The figure remains low, compared to 160 on Jan. 20, apparently because of a drop in the number of new infections among elderly people, many of whom have been vaccinated against COVID-19.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14401166

Hospital beds for virus patients in Tokyo fill to most serious level 4,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"July 22, 2021 at 16:30 JST"," The occupancy rate of hospital beds for COVID-19 patients in serious condition in Tokyo has reached the most severe stage, and scientists warn that the situation could rapidly worsen in the coming weeks. The occupancy rate hit 52 percent, putting that category in gauging the infection spread at stage 4 of a four-level alert under the central government’s standards. Tokyo is also at stage 4 in terms of the number of daily new COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, infected people with nonserious symptoms recuperating at hotels and homes, and the rate of positive tests for the virus, data by the metropolitan government showed. About 2,400 patients with COVID-19 are now hospitalized in the metropolis. The number of patients staying at home because they did not have access to hospital care or because they had mild symptoms soared to 3,657 on July 20, compared with 1,841 a week earlier. If the spread of novel coronavirus infections in Tokyo accelerates from the current pace, the capital will sink into a “crisis” situation in less than two weeks, health experts warned. That future scenario could prove more daunting than the record-setting wave of infections in winter, they said. A big concern in the latest increase is that the highly transmissible and potentially more deadly Delta variant has rapidly replaced other strains, they added. A rolling seven-day average of new infections over the week until July 20 was 1,170, up by 49 percent from 785 for the preceding week. A month ago, the seven-day average to June 21 was 387 new cases. The numbers indicate the novel coronavirus is now sweeping through Tokyo faster than when it pounded the capital in the third wave of infections between late 2020 and early 2021. If the pace continues at the current level, the seven-day average of new infections would reach an estimated 1,743 on July 27 and 2,598 on Aug. 3, health experts said. “The prediction for Aug. 3 would far exceed the peak seven-day average of 1,816 during the third wave of infections,” one of the experts said. The metropolitan government reported 1,832 new cases on July 21, the first time since Jan. 16 for the single-day count to top 1,800. But the official figure for newly confirmed infections in Tokyo may reflect only a fraction of the actual number. In a metropolis with 14 million people, the new COVID-19 cases are recorded from a limited number of tests for the virus. Data from the metropolitan government showed that the three-day average of PCR tests conducted until July 20 was 8,206. Perhaps more telling is that the seven-day average rate of positive results from the PCR tests rose to 10.2 percent as of July 20, up from 7.2 percent for the previous week. The Delta variant accounted for 30.5 percent of the new cases in Tokyo over the week through July 11, according to metropolitan government data. The ratio was 21.5 percent in the previous week. Statistics for the variant are not immediately available because genome sequencing to detect the strain takes time. “We should remain alert about the Delta variant,” a health expert said. Metropolitan government officials reported that crowd sizes in entertainment districts in Tokyo have shrunk slightly since the capital was placed under the fourth state of emergency from July 12. They underscored the need for Tokyo residents to stay home during the four consecutive holidays that began on July 22 to host the Olympic Games. Hiroshi Nishiura, professor of infectious disease epidemiology at Kyoto University, gave a grim prediction at a July 21 meeting of the health ministry’s expert panel on the coronavirus if measures are not taken to minimize the risk of spreading the contagion. He said the number of hospitalized COVID-19 patients in Tokyo could surpass 3,000 in mid-August if the effective reproduction number, or the number of secondary cases caused by one infected person, drops only by 10 percent from the current 1.2. He also said that without improvements in this category, serious cases of COVID-19 will sharply rise. The share of seriously ill patients in their 40s and 50s needing hospital treatment would soar because that age group was given lower priority in the vaccination program, and relatively few of them have been fully inoculated, Nishiura said. On July 22, the metropolitan government was expected to start services at Heisei Tateishi Hospital in Katsushika Ward for people who are battling COVID-19 but have no access to medical care. They can receive oxygen and medications while undergoing other examinations, including electrocardiograms and tests for their blood-oxygen saturation level, an indicator of their lung condition. The service is intended to help patients who cannot find hospital beds because they are rapidly filled up with COVID-19 patients.

Group: Use ‘plain Japanese’ in vaccine info for foreign residents,['By TOKO TANAKA/ Staff Writer'],"July 22, 2021 at 07:00 JST"," Many Vietnamese residents are facing language barriers concerning the COVID-19 vaccine program, prompting calls for simpler Japanese in notifications and instructions that non-Japanese speakers can understand. More than 90 percent of Vietnamese in Japan wish to be inoculated against the novel coronavirus, but about 60 percent do not even know the vaccinations are free of charge, a nationwide survey on Vietnamese residents showed. The results were released in June on the Kyoto Medical Practitioners Association website. A group, including Vietnamese doctors working in Kyoto Prefecture, obtained about 2,000 responses through the Vietnamese Embassy and Vietnamese communities in Japan. A combined 70 percent or so of the respondents said they feel “worried” or “very worried” about a shortage of vaccine information designed for foreign residents. Specifically, many of them said they cannot read and understand the notices they receive through the mail at their homes. Many also said they were concerned about possible side-effects from the vaccines. In response to the survey results, the Kyoto Medical Practitioners Association filed requests with the central government and local governments in Kyoto Prefecture to attach multilingual explanatory notes to vaccination vouchers distributed to residents. The association also asked that multilingual helplines and consultation services be made available, and that relevant information be shared on social media. “The unavailability of information on vaccines is a common problem faced by all foreign residents of Japan with language barriers,” said Pham Nguyen Quy, a Vietnamese doctor with the Kyoto Min-iren Chuo Hospital, who helped carry out the survey. The number of respondents doubled when the survey was posted on Taihen Network, a Vietnamese-language information website that is popular among Vietnamese in Japan, he added. “To spread information, public administration services should work with communities of non-Japanese and their support groups, and they should also use social media platforms that are viewed by non-Japanese,” Quy said. Many survey respondents also said they are concerned about possible miscommunication at vaccination venues. This screenshot from Yuko Takeda’s video shows how a typical phrase used at a vaccination venue, “Dangle your arm and ease the tension” (top two lines), can be paraphrased into a Yasashii Nihongo (plain Japanese) equivalent, “Your arm should be like this. Ease the tension” (bottom two lines). (Provided by Juntendo University) Japan was home to 2.89 million foreign residents from 195 countries and regions as of the end of June 2020, meaning that about one in every 40 residents in the country is non-Japanese. While it remains difficult to cover all of the languages, supporters are stressing the use of Yasashii Nihongo (plain Japanese), a set of guidelines for an alternative form of Japanese that can be understood more easily by non-Japanese. Yuko Takeda, a professor of medical education with the Juntendo University graduate school, recently created an animated video to show how phrases typically used at inoculation venues could be said in Yasashii Nihongo. The video, which runs for about two and a half minutes, was posted on YouTube earlier in July for free public viewing. For example, a health care worker may typically tell a vaccine recipient, “Dangle your arm and ease the tension.” A simpler equivalent, accompanied by a demonstrative body movement, is: “Your arm should be like this. Ease the tension.” A statement becomes easier to understand if it is short and does not use onomatopoeic words, such as the one associated with “dangle” in Japanese, Takeda said. “Health care workers use many unfamiliar words,” she added. “The use of Yasashii Nihongo will allow them to be understood better not only by non-Japanese residents but also by Japanese with hearing and comprehension problems and elderly people.” “Health care by Yasashii Nihongo,” a study group led by Takeda, is providing animated videos and a collection of phrases typically used at vaccination venues for free public access on its website ( https://easy-japanese.info/covid19 ).",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14394223

"Tokyo on pace for 1,382 virus cases by Opening Ceremony day",['By YUKI OKADO/ Staff Writer'],"July 19, 2021 at 17:49 JST"," The latest increase in novel coronavirus infections in Tokyo has already reached levels in the third wave but could worsen in the weeks ahead because of the more contagious Delta variant, heath experts warned. According to the Tokyo metropolitan government’s data, the rolling seven-day average of new cases topped 1,000 on July 17 for the first time since Jan. 27 during the third wave. As of July 18, the week-over-week rise in the seven-day average was 46 percent, a level higher than when Tokyo was placed under the second state of emergency on Jan. 7. If the 46-percent pace continues, the seven-day average of new COVID-19 cases would hit 1,382 on July 23, when the Olympic Opening Ceremony is scheduled to be held, 1,478 on July 24, and 1,560 on July 25. Tokyo’s highest seven-day average for new COVID-19 cases was 1,861, logged on Jan. 11. The current surge of infections could soon overtake that record if the rate of increase surpasses 46 percent. “We are in a very dangerous situation right now,” a metropolitan government official warned at a July 15 meeting on the infection situation in the capital. “You can be infected with the virus anywhere, and once infected, the virus will spread to family members and employees at workplaces.” The seven-day average of new infections week on week began rising fast in July. On July 13, the capital recorded a seven-day average of 791 new cases, up by 30 percent from the week earlier. Five days later, on July 18, the figure was 1,068, an increase of 46 percent. When the second state of emergency was declared for Tokyo on Jan. 7, the week-on-week increase was 42 percent while the seven-day average was 1,261. Hitoshi Oshitani, a professor of infectious diseases at Tohoku University who sits on the central government’s expert panel on the coronavirus, described the 42-percent rise as an “extremely unusual surge from an epidemiological viewpoint.” On Dec. 31, 1,353 daily new infections were confirmed in Tokyo, 392 more than the previous record set a day earlier. The number of new cases continued to soar in the following week,  pushing the health care system in the capital to the brink. Tokyo set a record of 2,520 daily new cases on Jan. 7. Oshitani said the sharp spike in winter can be traced back to a combination of exceptional circumstances in late December and early January. One explanation, he said, is that more people got tested for the virus after year-end parties and other events. Other test-takers were alarmed by the COVID-19 death of Yuichiro Hata, a 53-year-old senior official of the main opposition Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan, in late December. On Jan. 10, the seven-day average of new cases had shot up to 107 percent of the level of the previous week in Tokyo. Different from the third wave of infections, the latest state of emergency was issued for Tokyo relatively early in the surge in cases. And more people have now been vaccinated against the virus.

Survey: Suga Cabinet approval rating sinks to record low of 31%,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"July 19, 2021 at 16:46 JST"," The approval rating for the Suga Cabinet dropped to a record-low 31 percent, reflecting increasing frustrations among the public over vaccine shortages and “ineffective” anti-virus measures, an Asahi Shimbun survey showed. The rate was down from 34 percent in the previous survey in June, while the disapproval rating rose to 49 percent from 42 percent, according to the nationwide telephone survey of eligible voters conducted on July 17 and 18. Thirty-five percent of men and 27 percent of women approved the Cabinet, the survey showed. The government’s COVID-19 measures have been criticized since Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga formed the Cabinet in September last year. Amid the latest resurgence of new infections, 65 percent of survey respondents “lowly evaluated” the government’s responses to health crisis, compared with 26 percent who “highly evaluated” them. Concerning the COVID-19 vaccination program, a string of municipalities and workplaces have suspended their vaccination plans because of a shortage of doses. Sixty-three percent of survey respondents thought that “the government is greatly responsible” for the supply problem, while 32 percent said it is “not so much responsible.” Fifty-four percent of respondents “highly evaluated” the government’s vaccination efforts, down from 60 percent in the June survey. For the declaration of the fourth COVID-19 state of emergency for Tokyo, the government asked alcohol wholesalers to halt any dealings with eating and drinking establishments that defy requests to stop serving alcoholic drinks. It also called on financial institutions to urge these businesses to comply with the requests.. After criticism erupted, the government withdrew the requests. These actions “increased” the distrust of the Cabinet among 51 percent of respondents, while 45 percent said their distrust did “not increase so much.” Only 33 percent believe the current state of emergency will be “effective” in preventing the virus from spreading, while 66 percent think the declaration will be “ineffective.” Among voters in Tokyo, where the Olympics will start within days, 74 percent said the state of emergency will be “ineffective.” In the May survey, 41 percent of all respondents said a state of emergency would be “effective.” Suga’s term as president of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party will end in September. Fifty-four percent of respondents said they want Suga to “continue his job until the term ends.” Twenty-seven percent want Suga replaced before his term ends, compared with 14 percent who want him to continue in the post beyond the term, according to the survey. In the April survey, 19 percent wanted him out before the term expires. Among LDP supporters, 63 percent hoped Suga would remain at the post “until the term ends,” while 9 percent wanted a replacement before the term expires. Only 26 percent “wanted him to continue to serve as president beyond the term.” The survey was conducted by contacting both landline telephone numbers and mobile phone numbers selected at random by computer. It received 628 valid responses, or 55 percent, of the 1,142 landline numbers of households with at least one eligible voter. There were 816 valid responses, or 42 percent, from 1,963 mobile phone numbers of eligible voters. The valid responses totaled 1,444.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14398503

Zero risk? Virus cases test Olympic organizers’ assurances,['THE ASSOCIATED PRESS'],"July 19, 2021 at 07:40 JST"," Two South African soccer players became the first athletes inside the Olympic Village to test positive for COVID-19, and other cases connected to the Tokyo Games were also confirmed Sunday, highlighting the herculean task organizers face to keep the virus contained while the world's biggest sports event plays out. The positive tests came as some of the 11,000 athletes and thousands more team officials expected from across the globe began arriving, having traveled through a pandemic to get to Tokyo. They'll all now live in close quarters in the Olympic Village on Tokyo Bay over the next three weeks. International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach said last week there was “zero” risk of athletes passing on the virus to Japanese or other residents of the village. But that bold statement was already being tested. The Olympics, which were postponed for a year because of the pandemic, are set to officially open on Friday and run until Aug. 8. The two soccer players and a team video analyst who also tested positive had been moved to “the Tokyo 2020 isolation facility,"" the South African Olympic committee said. The rest of the squad members and officials had also been quarantined. Those positive tests further stoked local fears, with the South African team scheduled to play against host nation Japan in its first game on Thursday. There has already been consistent opposition from the Japanese public to holding the Olympics during the pandemic, with fears that it could become a super-spreader event and cause a spike in infections among Japanese people. Bach and the IOC have insisted it will be safe and have forged ahead against most medical advice. The IOC says it sees the Games as a chance to foster international solidarity during difficult times, but the IOC would also lose billions of dollars in broadcast rights if the Games were to be canceled completely. Also Sunday, Team South Africa confirmed the coach of its rugby sevens team also tested positive at a pre-Olympics training camp in the southern Japanese city of Kagoshima. He was also in isolation there and would miss the entire rugby competition, the team said. And there were other Olympics-related positive tests. Olympic organizers said that another athlete had tested positive, although they were not residing in the Olympic Village. The athlete was not named and only identified as “non-Japanese."" The first International Olympic Committee official was reported as positive. He recorded a positive test on Saturday when arriving at a Tokyo airport. The IOC confirmed the test and identified him as IOC member Ryu Seung-min of South Korea. He was reportedly being held in isolation, too. Former distance runner and world championship bronze medalist Tegla Loroupe, the chief of mission of the IOC’s Refugee Olympic Team, tested positive for COVID-19 before the team was to depart its Doha, Qatar, training base for Tokyo, two people with knowledge of her condition told the AP. The team delayed its arrival in Tokyo while Loroupe is expected to stay behind, according to the two people, who requested anonymity because they weren’t authorized to reveal medical information. Organizers say that 55 people linked to the Olympics in Japan have reported positive tests since July 1, but that figure does not include athletes or others who may have arrived for training camps but are not yet under the “jurisdiction” of the organizing committee. Tokyo reported 1,008 new COVID-19 cases on Sunday, the 29th straight day that cases were higher than seven days previously. It was also the fifth straight day with more than 1,000 cases. The Olympics will open under a state of emergency in Tokyo and three neighboring prefectures. No fans, Japanese or foreign, will be allowed at any of the Olympic sports in Tokyo and the three neighboring prefectures. A few outlying venues may allow a small number of local fans, but it has effectively become a TV-only event. About 200 protesters gathered Sunday outside Shinjuku station in central Tokyo, waving signs that read “No Olympics.” It was the latest in a series of small protests against the Games in the last few months. “This is ignoring human rights and our right to life,” protester Karoi Todo told the AP. ""Infections are increasing. To do the Olympics is unforgivable.” Japanese and IOC organizers hope stringent testing protocols, where athletes, team officials and others are tested daily, will mitigate the risks posed by the thousands of foreigners arriving at once. Visiting athletes, officials and media will be in a ""soft quarantine"" situation and restricted to the Olympic venues, the village and designated hotels, and will be kept away from the Japanese general public. The IOC also says more than 80 percent of the athletes set to compete in Tokyo will be vaccinated against COVID-19. But, despite the assurances, the positive tests five days out from the opening ceremony showed the regulations aren't--and can't be--foolproof. The South African team's chief medical officer said every member of the team had two negative tests before traveling to Japan “as per Tokyo 2020 requirements.” They also tested negative on arrival in Tokyo, Dr. Phatho Zondi said. ""Team (South Africa) officials and management have followed all relevant Olympic Playbook rules, protocols and procedures throughout the pre-Games and Games arrival routines,"" the South African Olympic committee said. Coach Neil Powell and the entire South Africa rugby squad were held at a quarantine facility after arriving in Japan because of a positive COVID test on their flight, Team South Africa said. They were cleared to leave, only for Powell to test positive a few days later. Powell had been vaccinated against COVID-19 with the one-shot Johnson & Johnson vaccine in South Africa on May 24, team spokesman JJ Harmse told the AP. South African Olympic and soccer officials didn’t immediately confirm whether the two soccer players and official who tested positive had been vaccinated, although South Africa’s Olympic committee said in May it would offer all its Olympic athletes the J&J vaccine. The Olympics were effectively over before they began for the two soccer players and Powell as they would have to remain in quarantine for 14 days under Japanese regulations. The only way the soccer players might be able to play is if their team made the semifinals. Powell would definitely miss the entire rugby competition and his Olympic experience will involve being kept in isolation in a room for two weeks before flying back home.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14398269

The figure of 1,410 was 460 higher than the previous Saturday, metropolitan government officials said. That marks four straight weeks in which the daily tally has been higher than the same day of the previous week. For the week ending July 17, the daily average of new cases came to 1,012, an increase of 40.5 percent over the previous week. The last time the daily average over the course of a week topped 1,000 was on Jan. 27, during the third wave of COVID-19 infections. As of July 16, the three-day average of government-administered COVID-19 tests was 8,394. Of the latest cases, 469 patients were in their 20s, 311 in their 30s, 232 in their 40s and 149 in their 50s. Officials said 110 patients were aged between 10 and 19 and there were 40 cases of infected individuals aged 65 or older. Metropolitan government officials also reported two fatalities from COVID-19 on July 17.

Japan’s Olympic security balancing act leaves few satisfied,['THE ASSOCIATED PRESS'],"July 17, 2021 at 18:17 JST"," Struggling businesses forced to temporarily shut down around Olympics venues. Olympic visitors ordered to install invasive apps and allow GPS tracking. Minders staking out hotels to keep participants from coming into contact with ordinary Japanese or visiting restaurants to sample the sushi. Japan's massive security apparatus has raised complaints that the nation, during the weeks of the Games, will look more like authoritarian North Korea or China than one of the world’s most powerful, vibrant democracies. The worry for many here, however, isn’t too much Big Brother. It’s that all the increased precautions won’t be nearly enough to stop the estimated 85,000 athletes, officials, journalists and other workers coming into Japan from introducing fast-spreading coronavirus variants to a largely unvaccinated population already struggling with mounting cases. “It’s all based on the honor system, and it’s causing concern that media people and other participants may go out of their hotels to eat in Ginza,” Takeshi Saiki, an opposition lawmaker, said of what he called Japan’s lax border controls. So far, the majority of Olympic athletes and other participants have been exempted from typical quarantine requirements. There have been regular breakdowns in security as the sheer enormity of trying to police so many visitors becomes clearer — and the opening ceremony looms. The Japanese press is filled with reports of Olympic-related people testing positive for the coronavirus. Photos and social media posts show foreigners linked to the Games breaking mask rules and drinking in public, smoking in airports — even, if the bios are accurate, posting on dating apps. “There are big holes in the bubbles,” said Ayaka Shiomura, another opposition lawmaker, speaking of the so-called “bubbles” that are supposed to separate the Olympics' participants from the rest of the country. The pandemic has tested democracies around the world as they try to strike a balance between the need to protect basic rights and the national imperative to control a disease that thrives when people gather in large numbers. Few places, however, have faced higher stakes than Tokyo will during July and August — or closer global scrutiny. The government, well aware of repeated domestic surveys that show strong opposition to the Games, argues that its security and monitoring measures are crucial as it tries to pull off an Olympics during a once-in-a-century pandemic. But as the restrictions are tested by increasing numbers of visitors, officials have been blamed for doing too much, and too little. The government and the Games’ organizers “are treating visitors as if they are potential criminals,” Chizuko Ueno, a professor emeritus of sociology at the University of Tokyo, said on YouTube. There's also lingering resentment over a widespread sentiment that Japan is facing this balancing act because the International Olympic Committee needs to have the Games happen, regardless of the state of the virus, to get the billions of dollars in media revenue critical to its survival. “The Olympics are held as an IOC business. Not only the Japanese people, but others around the world, were turned off by the Olympics after all of us saw the true nature of the Olympics and the IOC through the pandemic,” mountaineer Ken Noguchi told the online edition of the Nikkan Gendai newspaper. Senior sports editors at major international media companies, meanwhile, have asked organizers to “reconsider some measures that go beyond what is necessary to keep participants and residents safe,” saying they “show a disregard for the personal privacy and technological security of our colleagues.” Japan has fared better during the pandemic than many nations, but the Olympians will be arriving only a few months after a coronavirus spike had some Japanese hospitals nearing collapse as ICUs filled with the sick. While the surge has tempered, cases are rising enough for the declaration of yet another state of emergency in Tokyo. One of the highest-profile security problems came last month when a Ugandan team member arriving in Japan tested positive for what turned out to be the more contagious delta variant. He was quarantined at the airport, but the rest of the nine-person team was allowed to travel more than 500 kilometers (300 miles) on a chartered bus to their pre-Olympics camp, where a second Ugandan tested positive, forcing the team and seven city officials and drivers who had close contact with them to self-isolate. On Friday, a Uganda team member went missing, raising more questions about the oversight of Olympic participants. So what are the restrictions that Olympic-linked visitors face? For the first 14 days in Japan, Olympic visitors outside the athletes' village are banned from using public transportation and from going to bars, tourist spots and most restaurants. They cannot even take a walk, or visit anywhere, in fact, that’s not specifically mentioned in activity plans submitted in advance. There are some exceptions authorized by organizers: specifically designated convenience stores, takeaway places and, in rare cases, some restaurants that have private rooms. Athletes, tested daily for the coronavirus, will be isolated in the athletes’ village and are expected to stay there, or in similarly locked-down bubbles at venues or training sites. Those who break the rules could be sent home or receive fines and lose the right to participate in the Games. Everyone associated with the Olympics will be asked to install two apps when entering Japan. One is an immigration and health reporting app, and the other is a contact tracing app that uses Bluetooth. They will also have to consent to allowing organizers to use GPS to monitor their movements and contacts through their smartphones if there’s an infection or violation of rules. “We are not going to monitor the behavior at all times,” Organizing Committee CEO Toshiro Muto said. “The thing is, though, if there should be issues pertaining to their activity then, since the GPS function will be on, we’ll be able to verify their activities.” Japan also plans to station human monitors at venues and hotels, though it’s not yet clear how many. “We will control every entry and exit. We will have a system that will not allow anyone to go outside freely,” Olympic Minister Tamayo Marukawa said. Other nations, both democratic and autocratic, have also tried to control and monitor behavior and businesses during the pandemic. In the United States, for instance, NFL teams tracked their athletes in the team facilities. South Korean health authorities have aggressively used smartphone GPS data, credit-card transaction records and surveillance videos to find and isolate potential virus carriers. Tracking apps are used to monitor thousands of individuals quarantined at home. In China, mask mandates, lockdowns confining millions to their homes and case tracing on a nationwide scale have faced little or no opposition. North Korea has shut its borders even tighter, skipped the Olympics and canceled or seriously curtailed access for foreign diplomats, aid workers and outside journalists. While the security restrictions in Japan will be a hassle for visitors, they could also hit locals hard. Hiroshi Kato, a fencing instructor, said he worries that he’ll lose even more business than he did during the pandemic because he’s been ordered to move from the building where he works across from the main Olympics stadium from July 1 to Sep. 19, for unspecified security reasons. “I feel helpless,” he said in an interview. “To safely hold the Games, some restrictions are understandable … but (the organizers) knew this for a long time and perhaps could have provided some assistance for us.”",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14397538
1st case of COVID-19 at Olympic village in Tokyo,['By YUSUKE SAITO/ Staff Writer'],"July 17, 2021 at 17:51 JST"," The Tokyo Olympic organizing committee said July 17 that a foreign national staying at the Olympic village in Tokyo was its first confirmed COVID-19 case. No details were given about the individual's gender or nationality. All the organizing committee divulged was that an individual connected with the Olympics from overseas had been confirmed with the novel coronavirus and is now quarantined at a hotel set aside for those who are asymptomatic or with minor symptoms. The organizing committee also said that 14 individuals with Olympic accreditation tested positive for COVID-19 on July 17. They were connected in some way with the Olympics, either working for the organizing committee, mass media or suppliers at venues in Tokyo, Hokkaido, Chiba and Saitama. The organizing committee has been announcing confirmed COVID-19 cases tied to the Olympics on a daily basis, but 15 is the largest figure to date. Since July 1, when the policy was implemented, 45 individuals have been confirmed with the novel coronavirus.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14397511
Athletes in close contact with infected person can still compete,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"July 17, 2021 at 16:56 JST"," Olympic athletes in close contact with an individual confirmed to have COVID-19 will be allowed to compete if they test negative in a PCR check held just prior to their event under a special exemption granted for the Games. Tamayo Marukawa, the state minister in charge of the Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics, announced the exemption at a July 16 news conference. It flies in the face of measures applied to Japanese residents who are required to self-isolate at home for 14 days if they had close contact with a COVID-19 patient. “Preventing a spread of infections by implementing strict infection-prevention measures is our priority, but we also want to make it possible for athletes to participate in the events,” Marukawa said at a news conference. This latest step was conveyed through the Tokyo Olympic organizing committee to the international bodies governing each sport, according to officials of the Cabinet Secretariat. If the government enforced its self-quarantine policy for athletes who come into close contact with COVID-19 patients, it would likely mean they would be unable to compete in their chosen event. Any athlete confirmed to have been in close contact with a patient will be asked to remain in a single room for 14 days and prohibited from leaving except to train or compete, according to Marukawa and organizing committee sources. They will also have to take meals and travel to the training or competition venue by themselves, and undergo PCR tests daily. If they test negative for a PCR test given within six hours of the start of competition, the athlete will be allowed to compete. In sports such as judo where athletes are in close contact during competition, PCR tests will be administered after the match as well. A list of athletes thought to be at risk of having come into close contact will be drawn up beforehand to prepare for the event where an athlete tests positive.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14397404
‘5th wave’ of COVID-19 cases feared in Tokyo and Osaka,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"July 17, 2021 at 15:34 JST"," With just days to go before the Tokyo Olympics kick off, signs are emerging of a “fifth wave” in COVID-19 cases in major urban areas, particularly the capital and Osaka in western Japan. Tokyo on July 16 reported more than 1,000 fresh cases of novel coronavirus infection for the third straight day. Metropolitan government officials noted that a record 303 were confirmed with the more feared Delta variant. While Tokyo will remain under a state of emergency until Aug. 22, spreading infections in the three neighboring prefectures of Chiba, Kanagawa and Saitama led prefectural authorities on July 16 to decide to expand the geographical range of pre-emergency measures in their jurisdictions. The Kanagawa prefectural government on July 16 confirmed 446 new cases. The number of cases per 100,000 residents over the most recent week came to 26.1, which exceeded the standard of 25 to demarcate whether a prefecture is in the most serious stage 4 of infections spreading. Pre-emergency measures had been in place for four Kanagawa cities, Yokohama, Kawasaki, Sagamihara and Atsugi, but those steps will be expanded, effective July 22, to cover all municipalities, with the exception of Kiyokawa village which has a population of about 3,000. The Kanagawa prefectural government also issued its own “state of emergency” and is asking all establishments to no longer serve alcoholic beverages and close their doors at 8 p.m. “Infections are surging at a pace similar to the beginning of the year when we were under a state of emergency,” Kanagawa Governor Yuji Kuroiwa said at a July 16 news conference. “We expect hospital beds for COVID-19 patients to face a very tight situation by the end of July.” In Chiba Prefecture, new cases rose 1.3-fold over the previous week. Chiba Governor Toshihito Kumagai said asking the central government to declare a state of emergency was “a realistic option” if the infection increase rate remained unchanged. On July 16, the Chiba prefectural government decided to add the cities of Yachiyo and Kamagaya on July 19 to nine municipalities already covered by pre-emergency measures. Bars and restaurants in those municipalities can only serve alcohol until 7 p.m. and only to parties of one or two individuals who stay for less than 90 minutes. The Saitama prefectural government is also vastly expanding the number of municipalities covered by pre-existing measures from just Saitama and Kawaguchi. It said 18 municipalities, such as Kawagoe and Tokorozawa, will be added, effective July 20. “There is a clear increasing trend and new infections are spreading in those areas bordering Tokyo,” Saitama Governor Motohiro Ono said, pointing to new cases topping 300 on July 15 for the first time in about six months. Bars and restaurants in the affected areas will be asked to only serve alcohol to solitary customers or family groups. Osaka Prefecture on July 16 recorded its fourth straight day of more than 200 fresh COVID-19 cases, while neighboring Hyogo recorded the fourth straight day of more than 70 new cases. An advisory panel to the health ministry said an increase in pedestrian traffic was a key factor behind the rise in new cases. Studies showed July 14 that while nighttime pedestrian traffic gradually fell in Tokyo, there were increases in both daytime and nighttime pedestrian traffic in the three neighboring prefectures. Health experts raised concerns that infections could spread from the greater Tokyo metropolitan area to all parts of Japan. Nighttime pedestrian traffic in Osaka has also been on the rise since the state of emergency was lifted on July 11. The advisory board said it was clear that infections were also on the rise again in the Kansai region.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14397380

Government medical adviser urges more virus limits,['COMPILED FROM WIRE REPORTS'],"July 17, 2021 at 09:25 JST"," Japan’s top medical adviser for Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga’s government urged authorities to step up virus measures ahead of the Olympics and asked the people to avoid trips. Tokyo registered 1,271 new cases Friday, the day after recording a six-month high of 1,308. Dr. Shigeru Omi, who heads a government COVID-19 taskforce, says the next two months will be the “most crucial stage” in Japan’s fight against the pandemic. He urged people to watch the Olympics on TV at home with family members or close friends in small groups. Omi says the ongoing upsurge in the Tokyo region is likely to accelerate, with the summer vacation, the Olympics and the Buddhist holiday week in August when people are likely to travel. Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga last week declared a fourth state of emergency in Tokyo, which started Monday and lasts until Aug. 22. Nationwide, Japan has reported 830,000 cases and 15,000 confirmed deaths. International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach had suggested to Suga that if the virus situation improved spectators could be let into stadiums, media said. Omi said that it was unlikely that the number of daily coronavirus infection cases would fall in a short span of time to levels that justify holding the Games with spectators.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14397251
Tokyo hospitals bracing for the worst in virus infections,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"July 16, 2021 at 19:25 JST"," The latest surge in COVID-19 cases in Tokyo has medical experts so worried that some are suggesting canceling the Summer Olympics--even after the start of competitions--if the infection spread worsens. “The medical situation has already been at the highest alert level in Tokyo, and more infections will only put more pressure on the health care system,” Masataka Inokuchi, vice chairman of the Tokyo Medical Association, said at the Tokyo metropolitan government’s meeting on July 15 on measures to curb COVID-19 cases. “Please do not allow new infection cases to rise higher than they are now.” Tokyo’s medical facilities are starting to feel the strain. The number of hospitalized COVID-19 patients in Tokyo jumped to more than 2,000 in three weeks from around 1,200 in late June. The number of cases in which public health centers could not find available hospital beds for infected patients and asked the Tokyo metropolitan government to take over such cases tripled to 125 from 40 a month ago. The Tokyo metropolitan government did learn a lesson from the third wave of infections that started at the end of last year and pushed the medical capacity for COVID-19 patients to the limit. The government increased the number of beds for COVID-19 patients by more than 2,000 from early January, mainly at Tokyo-run or public corporation hospitals. Tokyo officials said they had secured 6,314 beds as of July 8, and more than 90 percent of them, or 5,882, are believed ready for COVID-19 patients. The hospital bed occupancy rate was 31.8 percent as of July 14. The Asahi Shimbun But a source familiar with the hospital-bed operation said that increasing the number of beds to resolve the growing virus problem is “a pie in the sky.” “More hospitals that can accept COVID-19 patients already don’t have enough beds to accept new patients,” the source said. A Tokyo official mentioned another problem that has been persistent during the pandemic: “If the number of patients soars, there won’t be enough medical staff in some cases who can provide care for the hospitalized patients.” Nihon University Itabashi Hospital in the capital’s Itabashi Ward has 56 beds prepared for COVID-19 patients with moderate and serious symptoms. Twenty-three of those beds were filled as of July 14. The number of COVID-19 patients at the hospital had hovered around 10 until June, but the figure doubled in just one week. According to the hospital, many of the infected patients during the third wave were in their 70s or older. But the hospital is now seeing more patients in their 40s or 50s. In a worrying trend, 40 percent of the patients over the past two weeks were infected with the more contagious Delta variant. “If new cases increase at this pace and the number reaches 2,000 per day, all our beds will quickly be filled,” Satoru Takahashi, chief of the hospital, said. He also said the hospital would be forced to assign additional general ward nurses to COVID-19 sections if the number of patients exceeds 30. Another hospital doctor who treats COVID-19 patients with serious symptoms said the availability of hospital beds is no solution if there is no one to take care of the patients. “Even if we have empty beds, we cannot accept patients unless we have enough medical workers,” the doctor said. “The speed of infections must be slowed down to prevent a ‘clogging’ in hospitalizations.” The latest state of emergency was declared for the capital on July 12. But crowds have been seen in entertainment districts, and pedestrian traffic and travel will likely increase in the summer holidays. In addition, thousands of Olympic-related visitors from overseas are now streaming into the country ahead of the July 23 Opening Ceremony for the Tokyo Games. Shigeru Omi, head of the central government’s panel on responding to the COVID-19 pandemic, mentioned his concerns at an out-of-session meeting of the Upper House Cabinet Committee on July 15. “People have gotten used to the state of emergency, so measures to restrict people’s actions and movements have become less and less effective,” he said. Omi urged the government to invest more time and effort into science technologies, such as vaccines and testing. ‘CONSIDER CANCELING OLYMPICS’ Nobuhiko Okabe, head of the Kawasaki City Institute for Public Health who chairs the Tokyo Olympic organizing committee’s expert panel on anti-virus measures, said drastic steps may be needed to protect the medical system and keep the public safe from the virus. “Like the serious situation in Osaka Prefecture during the fourth wave, if Tokyo falls into a state where people who need hospital treatment can’t be admitted to hospitals, we should consider canceling the Olympics,” he said in an interview with The Asahi Shimbun on July 13. “We have no time for the Olympics” if people cannot receive the necessary medical care, he said. Okabe added that he might ask the central government and the organizing committee to cancel the Olympics even after start of competitions.

Spiking COVID-19 cases in Tokyo could top third wave in a month,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"July 15, 2021 at 18:51 JST"," A panel of experts on the COVID-19 crisis on July 15 warned that the daily average of new cases could exceed 2,400 in Tokyo in four weeks' time, higher than the third wave peak. The panel advising the Tokyo metropolitan government also raised concerns about a crisis in the medical care system now that the number of hospitalized patients exceeded 2,000. Meanwhile, metropolitan government officials reported 1,308 fresh COVID-19 cases in the capital on July 15. The last time the daily tally exceeded 1,300 was Jan. 21. At the July 15 panel meeting, a report was submitted about the daily average of new COVID-19 cases over the course of a week. The figure for July 14 was 817, a sharp increase from the 625 of the previous week. The rate of increase was 31 percent, contrasting with the 24-percent increase of the previous week. The experts forecast that if that rate of increase remained unchanged, the average would reach 1,402 by July 28 and 2,406 by Aug. 11. The latter figure would exceed the 1,816 average at the peak of the third wave of infections in winter. A main cause of the recent surge in new cases is believed to be the Delta variant of the novel coronavirus. As of July 14, a total of 1,297 patients were found with that variant. The daily figure for July 13 was 178, a record high. The experts also reported that while the Delta variant made up 14.7 percent of all cases for the one-week period ending June 27, the figure had increased to 21.5 percent by the week ending July 4. One expert said the pace at which the Delta variant was becoming the main one had accelerated. One positive note reported at the panel meeting concerned pedestrian traffic, which was reported to have decreased in Tokyo following the start of the fourth state of emergency from July 12. According to a study by the Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Medical Science, over a three-day period from July 12, the nighttime pedestrian traffic had decreased by 6.3 percent while the daytime pedestrian traffic declined by 2.3 percent. “A certain level of cooperation has been obtained due to the state of emergency,” said Atsushi Nishida, who heads the Research Center for Social Science and Medicine at the institute, at the July 15 meeting. But he added to further restrain new infections there was a need to further limit the number of those thinking about visiting Tokyo for leisure purposes. The reports about an increase in new cases raised concerns about the availability of hospital beds to treat COVID-19 patients. One report was that the number of hospitalized patients rose sharply from the 1,200 or so level of late June to more than 2,000 in three weeks’ time. The number of cases reported by public health offices about not being able to find an open hospital bed for a patient had risen from about 40 or so a day about a month ago to 125 as of July 14. “If this situation should continue, there will be an increase in young and middle-aged patients with midlevel symptoms, and there is a possibility that could be followed by an increase in those with serious symptoms,"" said Masataka Inokuchi, vice chair of the Tokyo Medical Association, at the July 15 meeting. "" There is a need to reinforce the hospitalized medical care structure while keeping those factors in mind.” (This article was written by Yuki Okado and Momoko Ikegami.)",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14395900

Metropolitan government officials said the latest number not only exceeded the May 13 tally of 1,010 new infections, but it also topped the peak in the fourth wave of the infections, which was 1,121 set on May 8. The capital has now seen week-on-week increases in new COVID cases for 25 straight days.

"Delivery of Pfizer jabs to be cut 10% in Osaka, Tokyo’s Setagaya, more",['By JUNYA SAKAMOTO/ Staff Writer'],"July 14, 2021 at 17:21 JST"," The government will reduce the supply of Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine to local governments by 10 percent for the first half of August if they are deemed to have an excess stock of it. Taro Kono, the administrative reform minister who is in charge of the COVID-19 vaccine rollout, on July 13 revealed the change in the government’s plan of distributing doses of the vaccine, jointly developed by U.S. pharmaceutical company Pfizer Inc. and its German partner, BioNTech. Under the new plan, the central government will cut the shipment of some 350,000 doses of the Pfizer vaccine to such municipalities as Sapporo, Sendai, Nagoya, Osaka and Kita-Kyushu cities as well as Tokyo’s Setagaya, Ota and Adachi wards, according to the health ministry. The central government previously said that it would ship about 11.7 million doses of the Pfizer vaccine every two weeks in August and September and distribute 80 percent of the doses, or around 9.36 million, as a “base supply” to prefectural governments in proportion to their populations. The central government had also indicated that Pfizer shipments would be cut by 10 percent for local governments that have more than six weeks’ worth of excess stock as shown by its vaccination record system (VRS). The 350,000 Pfizer doses that the central government will stop supplying to local governments with an excess stock will be added to 1.755 million doses categorized as “adjustment supplies” for prefectural governments. Each prefectural government will allocate the adjustment supplies to municipalities. The central government said it is currently preparing to enable prefectural governments to access the VRS to facilitate a smooth distribution and to share the number of shots administered and other data starting on July 15.

South African Olympic rugby 7s squad exposed to virus on flight,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"July 14, 2021 at 17:12 JST"," The South African Olympic men’s rugby sevens squad was likely exposed to the novel coronavirus on their flight to Japan, forcing the cancellation of their trip to Kagoshima for a training camp. The team of 14 athletes and seven staff members arrived at Narita International Airport in Chiba Prefecture on the evening of July 13. Results of their COVID-19 tests at the airport’s quarantine station came back negative. But at least one passenger who boarded the same flight tested positive. The Tokyo Olympic and Paralympic promotion headquarters, set up under the Cabinet Secretariat, deemed that all 14 players and four of the seven staffers were possibly in close contact with the virus carrier, based on their seat numbers. The team, known as the Blitzboks or Springbok Sevens, was scheduled to travel to Kagoshima in southern Kagoshima Prefecture for a pre-Olympic training camp on July 14. But the trip was postponed, and the members were transported to temporary accommodations, city officials and others said on July 14.

Tokyo’s state of emergency lacks options to stop rising infections,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"July 13, 2021 at 19:21 JST"," After declaring a fourth state of emergency for Tokyo on July 12 amid a resurgence of COVID-19 cases in the capital, the government is finding it has few options left to stop infections other than vaccines. The government was compelled to take the initiative in issuing the emergency, lasting until Aug. 22, because delaying judgment even for one or two weeks over imposing it was believed likely to result in soaring infections. “Vaccination is the decisive card of anti-virus measures, as we have always said,” Chief Cabinet Secretary Katsunobu Kato said at a news conference on July 12. Kato said that the fourth state of emergency was issued to prevent infections from rising at an explosive speed across Japan until the vaccination efforts show effectiveness. According to the government’s tally, 29.6 percent of people had received at least one inoculation across the nation by July 12. Shigeru Omi, the chairman of the government panel of experts dealing with the pandemic, said at a July 8 news conference, assuming that more middle-aged or older people, who are more likely to develop serious symptoms, will get jabs, “ People will be more relieved than now around September, as medical capacity will less strained. ” But there is still an issue of how the ongoing resurgence will be contained. “We have the vaccine, but the many causes of why cases rise remain,” Omi said. COVID-19 cases are likely to spread in the summer, too, experts say. That’s because after the rainy season more people stay inside while running air conditioners with little ventilation. The second wave of infections started in Tokyo in last year in July. Hokkaido, where people often keep windows open when indoors, had no second wave at the time. But in autumn, the number of patients soared there, too. Cases of the most contagious Delta variant are currently increasing in the capital. Delta variant cases accounted for 14.7 percent among tested samples for the week through June 27, according to the Tokyo metropolitan government. The following week, the figure was 18.7 percent in the preliminary report. Delta variant cases are expected to account for more than 90 percent in Japan around the middle of August, according to the prediction by Hiroshi Nishiura, a professor at Kyoto University. If that happens, the Delta variant will become 1.9 times more contagious than the conventional virus and 1.3 times more contagious than the Alpha variant, which caused the fourth wave in the spring. “During the fourth wave, the state of emergency was issued earlier for Tokyo, which prevented a bigger wave like the one the Kansai region has experienced,” said Kazuhiro Tateda, professor of infectious diseases at Toho University, and a member of the government’s panel on the pandemic. “The fourth state of emergency is strongly intended to once again prevent a bigger wave,” he reiterated. “In the autumn, when most middle-aged or older people are fully vaccinated, the situation might be different. If we can contain the soaring infections fully, the fourth state of emergency could be the last one. We’ve got to make that happen.” But the government has few new measures for decreasing the number of infections. During the summer, the government is starting a new measure to test people who travel from airports in Tokyo and Osaka Prefecture to Hokkaido and Okinawa Prefecture if they give their consent. But its main measures to date have always been focused on eating and drinking establishments. The government is asking restaurants and bars that provide alcoholic beverages or karaoke service to suspend their business operations all day in the prefectures covered under the emergency. If establishments do not offer alcoholic beverages, they are being asked to close by 8 p.m. The government is also beefing up anti-virus measures, such as expanding testing capacity with simplified testing kits and ventilating indoor spaces as much as possible with devices that measure CO2 levels. But Mitsuru Fukuda, a professor of crisis management at Nihon University, pointed out that the public may be less than receptive to complying with policies to fight the virus. “People have been putting up with living under anti-virus policies for a year and a half, ” Fukuda said. “Their stress and dissatisfaction are accumulating and are going to exceed the threshold. Once they cross that, people will be beyond the point of no return.” Though the government said that the vaccine will be the decisive factor in fighting COVID-19 and pledged to swiftly get shots into arms, its insufficient supply and slow vaccine rollout is causing the public to lose faith. “People are disappointed at ad hoc policies and tend to give up their hopes for the government,” Fukuda said. “The key point is whether people are motivated to keep up the effort to follow the measures. “As for crisis management, if the strategy turns out to be wrong, you can change it. But you have to explain such a change every time. The government needs to persuade people to form a consensus. Other than the vaccination efforts, it should show the specific policies and measures and its road map, such as how many beds will be increased or reinforcing the quarantine. ” (This article was written by Akiyoshi Abe and Tokiko Tsuji, a senior staff writer.)",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14394086
Japan to soon accept requests for ‘vaccine passports’,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"July 13, 2021 at 18:47 JST"," Local governments will start accepting applications from July 26 for COVID-19 “vaccine passports” that certify holders have been inoculated against the virus if they are planning to travel overseas. Chief Cabinet Secretary Katsunobu Kato announced the development at a July 12 news conference. The move comes on the heels of calls, particularly from the business community, for vaccine passports as the United States and Europe are taking steps to require proof of inoculation against the novel coronavirus from arriving travelers. Kato said proof of vaccination will be issued only for people who expect to visit countries and territories where quarantine procedures will be eased if evidence of vaccination is presented. The documentation will come in written form stating when the individual received his or her vaccine shot, the type of vaccine administered and where, among other information. It will be provided at no charge for the time being. Those seeking proof will be required to submit an application and their regular passport to their local governments where their residence certificate is registered at the time they receive their jab. Kato said the government is not contemplating using vaccination proof for activities inside Japan. “It would be inappropriate if the availability of vaccine passports led to enforcing vaccinations or to discrimination against unvaccinated people,” he said. However, he indicated that the government may consider giving preferential treatment to those who opt to get vaccinated.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14394076

COVID-19 proposal for bars withdrawn after furor erupts,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"July 10, 2021 at 16:46 JST"," It took just 24 hours for the government to row back on plans to rely on financial institutions to help convince bar and restaurant operators to comply with COVID-19 emergency curbs following a sharp backlash. “We will not ask financial institutions for their cooperation,” Chief Cabinet Secretary Katsunobu Kato stated during his afternoon news conference on July 9. Only the day before, Yasutoshi Nishimura, the state minister in charge of economic revitalization who also heads the central government effort against the pandemic, drew howls of protest, not only from opposition lawmakers but even within the ruling coalition fearing a backlash from owners of bars and restaurants already reeling from the economic impact of the pandemic. Nishimura suggested that financial institutions would be asked to lobby customers that operate bars and restaurants to comply with government requests to temporarily close. He also did not deny the possibility of withholding loans to holdouts. His comment came after the central government decided July 8 to declare a fourth state of emergency for the capital between July 12 and Aug. 22, during which the Tokyo Olympics will have been held. Businesses in the capital that serve alcohol or provide karaoke services will be asked to close during that period. Not only did Kato say the central government was retracting Nishimura’s proposal, but added he had instructed Nishimura to be more careful about what he says during news conferences in the future. Prior to his news conference, Kato met with Hiroshi Moriyama, the chairman of the Diet Affairs Committee of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party. Moriyama asked Kato that care be taken so that the public did not get the wrong impression of what the government was intending to do.

Nishimura, appearing July 9 on a TV news program to answer criticism that his proposal was intended to abuse the hold financial institutions have over their customers, said, “Government agencies will not ask financial institutions to work” toward compliance with government requests on the part of bars and restaurants.

But Kono said the amount was decreased by more than 60 percent after further discussions between the government and Moderna. “Moderna vaccines are in high demand worldwide, and we, as the Japanese government, decided to secure the amount that we truly need after consultations with Moderna,” Kono said. Asked if Moderna told Japan that it would be difficult to supply 40 million doses by the deadline, Kono declined to give further details, saying, “The high demand for Moderna vaccines was an underlying reason.” He was also unspecific about when the contract was changed. “It was quite in the early days when we changed the 40-million-dose number,” he said. “I don’t remember exactly when. But for all I know, it was possibly before the Golden Week holidays (from late April).” Citing the contract, the Japanese government had declined to announce the actual amount of Moderna vaccines being supplied to the country. The company is expected to provide 50 million doses to Japan by the end of September. Its vaccine is being used mainly for inoculation programs at large companies and universities. In early June, the central government started accepting applications for Moderna shots in these programs. But demand was so overwhelming that the central government stopped accepting new applications and will not resume the process. Asked by a reporter if the government’s decision to decrease the Moderna supply has added to the confusion over the vaccine rollout, Kono said, “Not at all.”",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14389467
Kono: Pfizer vaccine supply to keep shrinking until September,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"July 7, 2021 at 16:40 JST"," The supply of Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccines will continue dwindling across Japan until at least September, according to a central government announcement that has done little to ease the frustration and anger among municipal governments. Many local governments have already stopped accepting reservations for the shots or even canceled bookings because of the central government’s failure to efficiently supply the doses. “We were told (by the central government) to pick up the pace to vaccinate people,” an Aomori prefectural government official said. “But now it feels like the ladder was removed before we could climb.” The inoculation process at the local level could become even more clogged under the new supply schedule for August and September, revealed by Taro Kono, the administrative reform minister who is in charge of the COVID-19 vaccine rollout, on July 6. Kono said at a news conference that the central government will ship about 11.7 million doses of the Pfizer vaccine every two weeks in August and September, down from the level of up to 18.7 million doses every two weeks in June. The government has already reduced the supply quantity for July. Around 9.36 million Pfizer doses, or 80 percent of the 11.7 million doses, will be categorized as a “base supply” and distributed to prefectural governments in proportion to their populations, Kono said. Additionally, 1.755 million doses, or 15 percent, will be categorized as “adjustment supplies” for prefectural governments. Each prefectural government will allocate the adjustment supplies to municipalities. Kono noted that some municipalities have many clinics and carry an excess stock of Pfizer vaccines, but others do not. He said prefectural government officials should make adjustments in distribution at their own discretion. “We will move (the vaccines) from prefectures that have excess stock to those that do not under a long-term vision,” Kono said. The remaining 5 percent of the two-month supply, or 585,000 doses, will be used at mass vaccination centers run by local governments. Kono also said Pfizer shipments will be cut by 10 percent for local governments that have more than six weeks’ worth of excess stock as shown by the central government’s vaccination record system (VRS). However, that VRS has proved ineffective in revealing real-time progress in inoculating the population. Delays at the municipal level in entering vaccination data into the system have led to mess-ups in supply distribution because of outdated information. Health minister Norihisa Tamura on July 6 said at a news conference that about 90 million doses of the Pfizer vaccine had been shipped to local governments by the end of June. But according to the VRS, the number of shots given is 50 million. “That means approximately 40 million doses are in circulation,” Tamura said. “There are mismatches going on.” The central government hopes the announcement of the two-month supply calendar will help dispel growing concerns among local governments, many of which will start large-scale vaccination campaigns targeting people under 65 this summer. However, for many municipalities, the new supply schedule is too little too late. The city government of Hirosaki in the northern prefecture of Aomori had intended to start accepting vaccine reservations for residents under 65 from July 7. But officials on July 6 halted the plan after learning that the central government would provide only 11,700 doses to the city in late July, despite Hirosaki’s request for 88,000 doses. “The central government’s ambiguous foresight has caused this situation,” Hirosaki Mayor Hiroshi Sakurada said. “I cannot contain my resentment.” The Aomori prefectural government is worried other municipalities will face the same fate because the central government’s late July shipment will be 88 boxes (1,170 doses per box), way below the prefecture’s order of 448 boxes. Similar concerns were raised in Miyagi Prefecture. The northeastern prefectural government learned that its supply of Pfizer vaccines from July 19 to Aug. 1 will only be about a quarter of its initial order. As a result, the prefectural capital of Sendai suspended taking new appointments on June 6. “Out vaccine project has been running smoothly up until now,” a city official said. “It is frustrating.” Many other municipalities have made those tough decisions. Major cities, such as Kobe and Osaka, stopped taking reservations for the Pfizer vaccine last week. Kobe officials have also canceled appointments already made by 50,000 people.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14389391

Report: Serbian tests positive arriving for Tokyo Olympics,['THE ASSOCIATED PRESS'],"July 4, 2021 at 18:05 JST"," A member of the Serbian Olympic rowing team has tested positive for COVID-19 while trying to enter Japan for the Tokyo Olympics that are to open in just under three weeks. The news was reported Sunday by the Japanese agency Kyodo and cited Japanese health ministry officials. Officials said the athlete was isolated at Tokyo’s Haneda airport. Four others traveling along were reportedly transferred to a facility near the airport. They had been scheduled to travel to a training camp in Nanto in central Japan. Nanto officials said the training camp was likely to be canceled. The report comes after two members of the Ugandan Olympic delegation tested positive for the coronavirus last month upon arrival in Japan. One tested positive at Narita airport near Tokyo, but the remainder of the team was allowed to travel to a training site. A second member of the delegation was found later to have the virus. Seiko Hashimoto, the president of the organizing committee, said on Friday that more than 500 participants had arrived in Tokyo without incident. About 11,000 Olympic and 4.400 Paralympic athletes will arrive for the Olympics, in addition to tens of thousands of other coaches, judges, and Olympic officials. Organizers still have not decided about allowing local fans into venues. Fans from abroad were banned months ago. Almost two weeks ago, organizers said they would allow indoor and outdoor venues to be filled to 50% of capacity up to 10,000. But with new infections rising daily in Tokyo for two weeks, local organizers are expected to meet this week with the International Olympic Committee and others and lower the cap, or remove spectators altogether. Japan media have reported many possible scenarios: They include: no fans at all; no fans at the opening ceremony on July 23; limits on fans at night events; dropping the limit at all venues to 5,000. Dr. Shigeru Omi, a top government medical adviser, has said repeatedly that no fans is the safest option. He has also questioned why the Olympics are being held at all in the middle of a pandemic. He has termed it “abnormal.”",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14387290

Municipalities forced to suspend vaccinations due to dire shortage,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"July 3, 2021 at 14:40 JST"," Already far behind many other countries, Japan's plans for a national rollout of COVID-19 vaccines--Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga's ace in the hole for pulling off the Tokyo Olympics this month--appear to be fast degenerating into yet another ill-conceived policy effort. Suga set a goal of 1 million jabs a day, along with an expansion of vaccination programs to ones handled by the Self-Defense Forces, workplaces and universities. Local government officials tried to comply with those moves, working hard to find locations and medical staff to carry out the task. The goal of 1 million shots was reached in June. It now turns out that the rush to vaccinate may be behind a shortage of vaccine supplies from later this month. Only about 30 percent of requests submitted by local governments for vaccines developed jointly by U.S. pharmaceutical company Pfizer Inc. and German biocommerce company BioNTech will likely be met in the two-week period from July 19, health ministry officials said. That led local governments to temporarily suspend accepting reservations for vaccinations due to uncertainties about how many vaccine doses will be available. The Osaka city government on July 2 decided to postpone the scheduled July 12 start of reservations for those 60 and older who have yet to receive a single jab. Chiba city next to Tokyo decided to stop taking reservations for senior citizens 65 and older trying to get their first jabs. The Yamagata city government on June 25 stopped taking reservations for shots at local doctors’ offices. Yamagata Mayor Takahiro Sato was clearly miffed with the central government over the confusion that has arisen. “In compliance with the government's policy, medical care professionals and city government officials did their level best to expand the vaccination program,” Sato said June 23 when the decision was made to suspend reservations. “But now limits have arisen on the supply of vaccines. There is incredible confusion among those handling the vaccinations.” In Osaka Prefecture, only about 80 percent of requests for vaccines from municipal authorities have been filled since June. The figure is expected to fall to 55 percent for the period between July 5 and 18. On July 2, Osaka Governor Hirofumi Yoshimura met with Taro Kono, the state minister coordinating the vaccination program at the central government level, and asked that prefectures that had been under a state of emergency due to the novel coronavirus pandemic be given priority for receiving vaccines. A similar request was made to Kono and Norihisa Tamura, the health minister, the previous day by the governors of Tokyo and its three neighboring prefectures. The Pfizer vaccine has been used to inoculate senior citizens aged 65 and older, the first group to receive jabs outside of medical care professionals. But the central government also announced plans to allow shots to be administered at workplaces and universities from June 21. The vaccine developed by Moderna Inc. of the United States is being used for the workplace vaccinations. Inundated with requests from companies and universities for vaccines, the Moderna supply of 50 million doses quickly ran out, leading the government to shift some of the Pfizer vaccines that would have been used by local governments at mass vaccination centers to the workplace program. Health ministry officials said they had received requests for about 100 million Pfizer doses from local governments for June and July. But only around 60 million doses are available for that period. Associates of Suga suggested that local governments may have to ask local residents in municipalities with a vaccine deficiency to wait longer than the normal three-week period before getting their second and final jab.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14386679

"Late-night drinking returns to Osaka, despite anti-virus rule",['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"July 2, 2021 at 18:11 JST"," OSAKA—Bar owners and customers here, fed up with the prefectural government asking for curtailed operating hours during the prolonged COVID-19 pandemic, are blatantly defying the latest request. Many drinking establishments in the city are now open and often crowded with customers well after 8 p.m., when they should have closed in line with the current pre-emergency measures in place in Osaka Prefecture. Some businesses in Osaka city’s Minami entertainment district have posted signs saying they would be closed until the pre-emergency measures are lifted. But one “izakaya” Japanese-style pub in the area was still open one recent night even at 10:30 p.m. And almost all of its 70 or so seats were filled. “I have to protect the livelihoods of my employees,” the izakaya’s manager in his 40s said. “I cannot tolerate (the government’s requests) any longer.” Most of the customers were young, and they were laughing and talking even though no plastic barriers were in place on the tables. The pub had shortened its business hours under the state of emergency that was lifted on June 20. Under the pre-emergency measures still in place, alcohol should not be served after 8 p.m. Although the izakaya manager knows about that requested deadline, his establishment remains open until midnight. On weekdays, he gets about 100 customers, while the number doubles on weekends. The manager said that in late 2020, he applied for money distributed to establishments that cooperate with the request to shorten their business hours. He finally received the funds in June. “I was in a very difficult situation having to wait six months,” the manager said. The pub has a staff of about 20. He acknowledged that many other businesses in the vicinity have continued to comply with the prefectural government request. “We all have our lives to live,” the manager said. “From now, I believe we have to take responsibility on our own in deciding how long to remain open.” A number of places around JR Tenma Station were also open well beyond 8 p.m. Some businesses with signs saying they would close at 8 p.m. were still operating close to midnight. A 22-year-old university student who was waiting in line with two friends to enter a bar also expressed frustration with the requested restrictions on serving alcohol. “We decided to go out drinking for the first time in a long time because the state of emergency was lifted,” the student said. “We searched for a place that was open until late because if we are to drink, we want to do so until after midnight. “Because we held off for such a long time, I think the sense of urgency among younger people has weakened.” Some businesses said they have found it difficult to comply with other government requests on measures to halt the virus. One such request is to allow entry to groups of two customers at the most. A fortysomething owner of an izakaya recalled the time three regulars showed up. “I couldn’t bring myself to refuse them,” he said. Two tables were set up about a meter apart so the trio would be separated but close enough to hold a conversation. The owner said he knows of businesses that no longer comply with the government requests. “Customers are flocking to those businesses that are open until late, and I feel that is increasing the risk of infection,” he said. Osaka Prefecture has dispatched about 800 workers to check for compliance with the requests, but that task has proved rather futile, given that there are about 58,000 bars and restaurants in the prefecture. They work in teams of two for the patrols. One team set a quota of checking 20 businesses a night. The pair only managed to check on 15. One prefectural government employee on patrol said bar owners have complained about not receiving the government money for cooperating with the requests. A colleague was lectured for about an hour by another business owner for visiting without an appointment. Osaka Governor Hirofumi Yoshimura urged local residents to report any establishment that remains open after 8 p.m. “We will be unable to control infections if more businesses decide they can do whatever they want,” he said.

Experts: Virus cases in Tokyo rising faster than during 4th wave,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"July 2, 2021 at 15:05 JST"," The novel coronavirus is now spreading in Tokyo at a faster pace than during the fourth wave of infections this spring, according to health experts, who called for tighter restrictions on alcohol-serving businesses. The situation in the capital was discussed at a meeting on July 1 of a COVID-19 monitoring panel set up by the Tokyo metropolitan government. The health experts on the panel urged the government to take swift measures to prevent the deteriorating virus situation from straining the medical care system again. The panel found that at least two categories regarding the infection spread in the capital had reached the most serious stage 4. Metropolitan government officials have said they would again ask bars and restaurants to stop serving alcohol if stage 4 levels were reached. Tokyo reported 673 new COVID-19 cases on July 1. That brought the daily average of new infections per 100,000 people to 26.49 for the week ending the same day. A figure of 25 or greater indicates stage 4 for this category. The number of patients recuperating from COVID-19 per 100,000 residents on June 30 was 32, exceeding the stage 4 figure of 30. The hospital bed usage rate for COVID-19 patients as of June 30 was 25 percent, which was still at the second highest stage 3 level. Another finding presented at the meeting was that the daily average of new cases over a week had increased by 20 percent over the previous week. There have now been increases for three straight weeks. The panel experts noted that pedestrian traffic around entertainment districts has risen in comparison to late March. That increase was their basis for warning about the quicker pace of new cases than during the fourth wave. The panel presented a simulation on the situation in Tokyo if new COVID-19 cases continue to rise by more than 20 percent over the previous week. It showed that in four weeks, the daily number of new infections would exceed 1,043. Atsushi Nishida, who heads the Research Center for Social Science and Medicine at the Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Medical Science, reported that over the 10-day period after June 21, when the state of emergency was replaced by pre-emergency measures, nighttime pedestrian traffic around major entertainment districts increased by 21.5 percent. The Asahi Shimbun Between 10 p.m. and midnight over that 10-day period, congestion still increased even though bars and restaurants are supposed to stop serving alcohol at 8 p.m. Nishida said the late-night pedestrian traffic had already reached levels of late March when Tokyo entered the fourth wave of infections. He added that people who remained out until late at night were at greater risk of becoming infected. Metropolitan and central government officials have already raised the possibility of issuing new requests for businesses to stop serving alcohol. But other officials said such calls may no longer be heeded, given the fatigue people are feeling from having to comply with such requests for more than a year. Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike took part in the meeting remotely, the first time she was seen in public since entering a hospital to rest from fatigue on June 22.

Spreading virus threatens plans to let spectators attend Olympics,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"July 1, 2021 at 18:55 JST"," The resurgent number of new COVID-19 cases in Tokyo has raised concerns among government officials that the Olympic Games could be held without spectators after all. Health experts on June 30 warned the government against lifting COVID-19 pre-emergency measures for Tokyo as scheduled on July 12, saying newly confirmed infections in the capital have neared the most serious stage 4 level concerning the spread of the virus. They said now is the time for a quick response to the new outbreaks, not an easing of the anti-virus measures. Data from an expert panel advising the health ministry showed the number of new cases per 100,000 people came to 24.59 in Tokyo in the most recent week, up 25 percent from the preceding week. If the number is 25 or higher, it indicates a stage 4 situation. “It would not make sense to lift the pre-emergency measures as scheduled,” said Kazuhiro Tateda, professor of infectious diseases at Toho University and a member of the panel. Tokyo reported 673 new COVID-19 cases on July 1, 103 more than a week ago. It was the 12th straight day for the daily count to increase from the previous week. One factor behind the rising numbers is the spread of the Delta variant, which was first identified in India and is far more contagious than the strain that swept across Japan last year. The National Institute of Infectious Diseases estimates that the Delta variant will cause more than half of all new COVID-19 cases in Japan by the middle of July, up from roughly 30 percent at the end of June. The daily number of new cases in Tokyo will top 1,000 by the end of July, according to an estimate by Kyoto University and the NIID. But that figure was based on the “most optimistic scenario” of a small impact from the Delta variant and no increase in people’s movement during the Summer Games. The Opening Ceremony for the Olympics is scheduled for July 23. The health experts said strong measures to swiftly deal with the current situation, such as declaring another state of emergency, coupled with the acceleration of the vaccination program could help Tokyo keep open more than half of its hospital beds for seriously ill COVID-19 patents. But if such decisions are delayed, hospitals will be flooded with patients, they added. Senior officials of the Suga administration are growing worried about the resurgence in Tokyo because it could jeopardize plans to allow spectators to attend the Olympic Games. The central and Tokyo metropolitan governments, as well as the Tokyo Olympic organizing committee and other organizations, agreed on June 21 to let fans fill half of the competition venues up to a maximum of 10,000 people. The agreement was based on the assumption that pre-emergency measures in Tokyo would be lifted on July 12. But they also decided that holding the Summer Games without spectators would be an option if a fourth state of emergency is declared for the capital or if the pre-emergency period is extended beyond the original deadline. Suga has said he wants the Olympic events to be held with spectators. The prime minister is seeking to avoid declaring a state of emergency because it would effectively rule out allowing spectators in the stands. Such an emergency declaration would also call into question the legitimacy of Suga’s statement that holding the Tokyo Olympics would be “proof that humanity has defeated the novel coronavirus.” If the pre-emergency measures are extended in the capital, the government is expected to make a “political” decision over the spectator number. However, calls have grown for a no-spectator decision if the Games are held under pre-emergency measures. A senior Diet member of Suga’s Liberal Democratic Party said the words “state of emergency” have a negative ring, and they would hurt Japan’s image at home and abroad if such a declaration is in place during the Olympics. An aide to the prime minister, echoing other officials’ views, pointed to a possible solution for the growing health problem: “Vaccines can be game changers.” The vaccine program to inoculate people 65 or older, an age group most susceptible to serious symptoms if infected, has made progress. In Tokyo, patients in their 60s or older represented about 20 percent of new infection cases as of January. But their share dropped to below 10 percent in the most recent week. Some senior members of the Suga administration said the hospital system in the capital could avoid being overstretched if the number of new COVID-19 patients in the vulnerable older age groups declines, even if the overall figure increase. “The coronavirus will become just an ordinary cold if it does not cause severe symptoms,” said a high-ranking official at the prime minister’s office. The official indicated that the administration could sidestep the emergency issuance by citing the status of the health care system, one of factors that must be weighed before deciding on such a declaration. However, such an approach would likely fuel criticism that the Suga administration is putting the Olympics above everything else, including the safety of the people it represents, in the pandemic. More than 14,500 people in Japan have died from COVID-19. “Even if the government says a spike in new cases is no big deal if patients do not become seriously ill, few outside the government will buy it,” said another senior official at the prime minister’s office. “I am afraid that the government will not be able to gain support from health experts, either.” (This article was compiled from reports by Jun Tabushi, Ko Nagata, Kai Ichino, Hiroshi Ishizuka and Kohei Morioka.)",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14385113

Olympic teams to be quarantined if even 1 member tests positive,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"June 30, 2021 at 19:05 JST"," All members and staff of an Olympic delegation will be isolated if at least one of them tests positive for the novel coronavirus after entering Japan for the Tokyo Games, according to the top government spokesman. “If infections (among an Olympic delegation) were confirmed at a host town or elsewhere, all athletes and their staff will be isolated in private rooms and barred from taking part in (training and other) activities,” Chief Cabinet Secretary Katsunobu Kato said at a news conference on June 30. “They can resume their activities unless they are confirmed to have come into close contact with patients and been infected with the virus in a retest.” The government will revise its manuals for host towns accepting Olympic teams from overseas to include the new anti-infection measures. Kato said the government held a meeting on the morning of June 30 to explain the new policy to concerned municipalities. He also revealed how the government intends to handle cases where members or staff of an Olympic delegation test positive at airport quarantine checks. Kato said the government plans to identify people who may have come into close contact with the infected individuals while traveling to Japan and transport them to their accommodations separately by bus. According to sources, those found in close contact with an infected individual will be quarantined at a hotel in Tokyo or surrounding prefectures if it takes five hours or more by vehicle from the airport to the team ’ s host town. If it takes less than five hours, the close contacts will be transported to the host town. It takes five hours or more if the host town is about 300 kilometers away, the sources said. The policy will be in place from July 1 through July 12 before the Olympic village opens. Kato previously said officials at the athletes’ host towns would be responsible for coordinating with local public health centers to determine who had been exposed to the virus from athletes or team staff confirmed to be infected by airport quarantine checks. But the government has come under fire after the Ugandan delegation was allowed to travel to their host city, Izumisano, Osaka Prefecture, without undergoing inspection to identify who may have come into close contact with a coach who tested positive at Narita Airport outside Tokyo on June 19.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14384473

Japan gives up on restarting workplace vaccine program,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"June 30, 2021 at 17:40 JST"," Japan will abandon restarting its highly touted mass vaccination campaign at workplaces and universities because demand for the doses has far exceeded supply, government sources said. Inundated by applications from companies and universities, the government stopped accepting new ones as of 5 p.m. on June 25. The inoculation campaign uses the Moderna vaccine. Taro Kono, the administrative reform minister who is in charge of the COVID-19 vaccine rollout, has said Japan will not order additional supplies of Moderna vaccines. At a news conference on June 29, Kono said he “will announce a policy of some kind” this week. The announcement will likely be the decision not to restart that vaccination program, according to the sources. The government started scrutinizing the applications to see if companies and universities have requested more doses than they need. But a top official of the prime minister’s office said, “It is difficult to continue using Moderna vaccines for the workplace project.” The government has promised to distribute 50 million doses of the Moderna vaccine, enough to inoculate 25 million people, by the end of September. Of that volume, 33 million doses are expected to go to companies that can inoculate at least 1,000 people as well as universities. The application process began on June 8, and some companies and universities started inoculating staff and students from June 21. As of 5 p.m. on June 25, applications for about 36.42 million doses were filed in the company-university program. According to the sources, the remaining 17 million Moderna doses are expected to be used by local governments. “Any leftover doses should be diverted to the mass vaccination programs of local governments,” the official at the prime minister’s office said. Applications for about 12 million doses have been approved for local governments’ mass vaccination sites, while applications for another 12 million or so doses have been received but approval is pending. To cover the expected shortage of Moderna vaccines for these sites, the government will divert Pfizer vaccines from municipal governments’ vaccination programs.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14384199
Suga’s promise to vaccinate the elderly by August remains elusive,['THE ASAIH SHIMBUN'],"June 30, 2021 at 17:10 JST"," More than half of people 65 or older have now received at least one COVID-19 vaccine shot, government statistics reveal. But the current pace of the rollout raises questions over whether Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga’s goal of having all elderly people who want to receive it complete the two-dose vaccination process by the end of July is within reach. According to data released through the website of the prime minister’s office, about 20.67 million people who are 65 or older, or 58 percent, have received their first dose of the Pfizer vaccine as of June 28. Only about 8.66 million elderly people, or 24 percent, have received two shots and completed the inoculation process. Meanwhile some 14.81 million seniors, or 42 percent, have yet to start the process. Suga declared his “by the end of July” target for the first time at a news conference on April 23, after he decided to issue the third state of emergency for Tokyo and three prefectures. “The government as a whole will undertake the task so that each local government can administer vaccines twice to all elderly people who want to be vaccinated by the end of July,” he said. Suga’s aides were even more optimistic about the timetable. “All elderly people who want to be vaccinated will receive at least the first shot by the end of June,” one aide had said initially. But to meet the government’s end of July deadline, a hefty number of elderly people must receive their first shot by July 10 because the Pfizer vaccine requires a three-week waiting period between administering the first and second shots.

"Olympic bus drivers, security guards struggle to get vaccinated",['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"June 28, 2021 at 17:40 JST"," Several hundred thousand people who are expected to play direct roles in the Tokyo Olympics next month have been left out of the loop in the accelerated vaccination process for athletes, organizers and volunteers. Plans to inoculate shuttle bus drivers, security guards and other mainly subcontracted workers before the Games are nowhere in sight. Organizers of the Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics have been informed of the problem, but they have offered no solutions and only reiterated that the Summer Games will “be safe and secure” from the COVID-19 crisis, sources said. In Gifu Prefecture, 27 bus companies are expected to dispatch up to 79 buses and 280 drivers for the Olympic and Paralympic Games. “Almost all of the bus drivers have yet to receive a COVID-19 vaccination voucher,” Yoshiaki Kishino, chairman of the Gifu Prefecture Tourism Federation, said on June 18 at a prefectural government meeting on dealing with the novel coronavirus pandemic. Citing the fact that the vaccine must be administered twice to be effective, Kishino said, “It will not happen in time for the Olympics.” He said he is seeking help from the prefectural officials: “We are trapped in a difficult situation.” Kishino also said the problem “should have been dealt with by” the Tokyo Organizing Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games. But the committee had not given him any answer, except “it’s under review,” he said. Sho Hiraki, vice governor of the central Japan prefecture, made an impromptu decision to administer the first shot to about 130 bus drivers at the Gifu prefectural government’s mass vaccination center by July 4. Bus drivers in Mie Prefecture in the Kinki region have faced a similar challenge. Fourteen bus companies in the prefecture will dispatch vehicles and drivers to help out in the operation of Tokyo Olympics. But many drivers are still waiting to receive a vaccine shot, according to the Mie Bus Association. “Some drivers might say, ‘I don’t mind transporting vaccinated athletes, but I won’t go if it’s a pick-up and drop-off service for members of the media who may not have been vaccinated,’” a representative of the association said. The Olympic organizing committee has not made vaccinations mandatory for people involved in the sporting events. However, the committee has started a project to inoculate staff members and volunteers whose tasks require them to be frequently in close proximity to athletes. Subcontracted worker, such as bus drivers, are left to get the vaccine on their own. In many cases, such subcontractors have relied on their local government’s mass vaccination program. A representative of a bus company in Nagoya said options are limited for local bus companies. Only a few major bus companies in the capital of Aichi Prefecture can inoculate their employees through company-wide vaccination programs, the representative said. The representative’s company is expected to dispatch drivers to the Olympics, but it has no clear idea on when they can get vaccinated. “We are hoping our drivers are allowed to get the vaccine through the workplace vaccination programs of other companies,” the representative said. Time is also running out for many security companies to have their workers inoculated in time for the Olympics. A man in his 30s who lives in Tokyo and is expected to work as a security guard at the Olympics said he received his first dose at a mass vaccination center. But he said many of his colleagues have been unable to even make an appointment. “Being a security guard, I will inevitably come near many and unspecified persons, such as athletes, officials and spectators,” he said. “It is scary to have many unvaccinated security people working at (the Olympics).” About 600,000 security guards are expected to work before, during and after the Olympic and Paralympic Games. The All Japan Security Service Association has asked the central government to give security guards priority in receiving the vaccine. But that has not happened. Despite the concerns of those directly involved, the Olympic organizing committee has taken the stance that there is nothing to worry about. “We have built a testing system to make the event safe without a vaccine,” a top official of the organizing committee said. “We will carefully explain to all staff members that there is no problem if they practice infection control as per usual.”",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14382758

"Testing at elderly care facilities expands, but at a snail’s pace",['By TOMOE ISHIKAWA/ Staff Writer'],"June 28, 2021 at 15:25 JST"," The central government’s bid to ramp up COVID-19 testing on caregivers and staff at eldercare facilities to prevent infection clusters has faced delays from some reluctant facilities worried that more rigorous testing could cause staff shortages. The health ministry has urged local governments to conduct regular PCR tests focusing on workers at eldercare facilities, a key coronavirus battleground where most clusters are occurring. Testing has been stepped up, but slowly, with some areas running tests less frequently and many smaller facilities expressing reluctance out of fears positive results could strain their operations. “Small facilities like ours do not have many workers, so it will be difficult to operate the facility if someone tests positive,” said the head of a Tokyo facility. Infections have spread at eldercare facilities like wildfire, government figures show. According to data collected by the health ministry, 1,711 infection clusters had broken out at elderly care facilities nationwide, as of June 21. That number was the largest among the categories, exceeding those from restaurants and bars and health care facilities. In early May, it was revealed that 38 residents died at elderly care facilities in Kadoma, Osaka Prefecture, and Kobe. Focusing testing on workers at such facilities is a measure aimed at discovering asymptomatic COVID-19 patients quicker to prevent infection clusters from occurring. The ministry’s guidelines request that facilities located in areas under a state of emergency or pre-emergency measures test their workers once a week, or at least once every two weeks. But the frequency of testing varies by municipality. During the period from February to March this year, the ministry announced a policy to conduct caregiver-focused testing at facilities in 10 prefectures under the state of emergency. But only about 15,000 facilities actually did the testing, about half of the ministry’s target. In response, the ministry issued a request to facilities in late March to conduct focused testing more actively between April and June. The ministry expanded the number of target facilities to 76,656, including those taking care of disabled people. As of June 2, 47,400 facilities, or 62 percent, requested the testing. The ministry said many facilities reported that they would not conduct the testing due to concerns it would leave them short of workers. Many larger facilities have done the testing, while smaller facilities have tended to express concerns about staff testing positive if they run the tests, the ministry said. “I feel nervous when I conduct tests,” the head of the Tokyo care facility said. “I feel uneasy about whether the facility can stay in operation if someone tests positive for the virus. There are staff who are stressed about the testing.” The facility nonetheless complied with the ministry’s request and tested its staff, but voiced concerns that the burden of testing has increased. An infection cluster broke out at that facility last year, but staff who did not contract the virus had managed to keep the facility running. Yasuhiro Yuki, a social welfare professor at Shukutoku University, said that small facilities do not have close ties with other facilities, and it is difficult for them to bolster their workforce amid a labor crunch if someone tests positive. “There should be a measure for securing manpower (for these small facilities), such as appropriating a budget to dispatch caretakers to a facility that has a COVID-19 case,” he said.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14382671
Nishimura: New Tokyo state of emergency likely amid virus surge,['By KOHEI MORIOKA/ Staff Writer'],"June 28, 2021 at 15:19 JST"," The government will declare another COVID-19 state of emergency for areas now under pre-emergency measures if needed, the state minister of economic revitalization indicated on June 27 amid a resurgence in infections in Tokyo. ""The number of new infections in the capital and other areas in the greater Tokyo metropolitan area is clearly trending upward,” Yasutoshi Nishimura, who is also in charge of the government’s novel coronavirus measures, said during a program aired by Japan Broadcasting Corp.

Following the lifting of the emergency declaration, the Tokyo metropolitan government began allowing bars and restaurants to serve alcohol if they meet certain conditions. But Nishimura hinted at another ban on serving alcohol, saying the government needs to consider taking stronger anti-virus measures.

The pandemic is making school life a lot harder for children,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"June 28, 2021 at 07:00 JST"," More than a year of the pandemic upending students’ lives has led to reports of an increasing number frequently visiting school nurse’s offices, skipping classes and generally struggling to adapt to their situations. Education facilities imposed strict behavioral restrictions in efforts to contain the pandemic, piling extra stress onto students at elementary and junior high schools who are finding it difficult to share their troubles with adults, according to new data. School nurses, who witness firsthand the effect the pandemic is having on students every day, are feeling a growing sense of crisis about the increasing number of kids unable to cope with the change. “I am surprised at the continuous stream of students coming to the nurse’s office,” said a school nurse at a public junior high school in the Kanto region around Tokyo. The nurse said that every day following the May holiday period, a succession of no fewer than 10 students stopped by their office once morning classes began. The students usually complain they are “feeling sick” and have stomachaches. The academy has fewer than 300 students, but nearly 20 of them--including some who had refused to go to school before the pandemic--are routinely late for class, go home early, and are absent from school for prolonged periods. “The number is larger than usual,” the school nurse said. One student said he did not sleep at all on one school night because he stayed up and “played a video game until morning.” This is just one of many cases of students struggling with being banned from going out and finding themselves increasingly immersed in online environments and video games. “The extension of life with the coronavirus has had an impact on children’s bodies and minds,” said the school nurse. One publicly run elementary school in Tokyo with almost 500 students said nearly 20 children have been unable to leave the nurse’s office, or often do not appear at class. Under normal circumstances, only a few students a year show these troubling signs. The 30-year-old nurse there said the “influence of last year’s nationwide school closure remains,” and noted that educators were unable to determine how their students’ lives and behavior had changed over that period, even though they phoned their homes. It became impossible for the school to respond quickly to family rifts and students’ deteriorating mental health, resulting in some cases of refusing to attend school, according to educators. As all school trips and other events were canceled last year, students were deprived of opportunities to improve their psychological states and human relationships. “Teachers also lost chances to effectively reach out to children,” said the school nurse. “If this continues, it would be no wonder if people consider school to be an unattractive place to go to.” PHYSICAL AND MENTAL STRAIN A teacher at a ward-run junior high school in Tokyo in his 50s said that more children are eating poorly now. Several children in each class ask teachers to reduce the volume of their school lunch and return part of the served meals. He is also concerned about the fact that an increasing number of students are being absent from school about once a week or so, citing reasons such as headaches and feeling ill. Each situation is different depending on the school and region. The school nurse at a public junior high in Saitama Prefecture argued that “fewer students than previously reported are becoming sick now, thanks to the thorough surgical mask use and hand washing practice.” Megumi Tsukakoshi, 49, a school nurse at the junior high school affiliated with a state-run college in the capital, said the physical and mental toll that the prolonged health crisis is exacting on children “will start to fully surface.” Reports of struggling students unwilling to attend class or skipping school tend to crop up more at the junior high level after the end of the summer vacation period. But this year, those instances have been on the rise since the May holiday period. “There are fewer opportunities to engage students in a way that is stimulating under the various restrictions, sapping students’ mental energy,” Tsukakoshi said. According to Tsukakoshi, maladjusted kids often suffer from a lack of emotional energy, and adults remaining unaware of their problems could lead to serious adverse outcomes, including suicides. “Maladjustment is an important sign,” Tsukakoshi warned. “It is essential for us to allocate more time to listen to each child’s problems in person.” LESS PATIENCE, HARDER TO CONCENTRATE Troubling statistics suggest the burden the pandemic is placing on students is getting worse. Hideyuki Tobe, a professor of school health studies at Saitama University, conducted a survey between March and early May this year of 500 school nurses across Japan. More than half said that “more children are failing to adapt to school life, such as by refusing to go to school, frequenting nurses’ offices or feeling reluctant to attend class,” at 54 percent. The ratio in the same survey in July-September last year was 43 percent. Respondents could choose more than one answer. Those who reported “signs of excessive use of video games and the internet” among students accounted for 76 percent--around the same level as in the previous study. According to the survey team, children are “shying away from personal contact while they are wearing masks, rendering it difficult to build strong friendships with others.” As events are also called off, students “cannot find something to pour their passions into.” The team concluded that the “continuation of such school days are behind the issue.” The National Center for Child Health and Development carried out a survey from February through March that asked 501 elementary, junior high and senior high school students about the emotional and mental strain caused by the pandemic. Twenty percent of the students reported harming themselves or their family members, while 37 percent said they now “become easily irritated” and 32 percent said they “cannot concentrate these days.” All those figures increased from the previous study held between September and October last year, in which the rates of students who reported injuries, irritation and being unable to concentrate were 7 percent, 30 percent, and 26 percent, respectively. Respondents who said “it has become more difficult to talk to or consult with teachers and other adults” over the last year reached 51 percent. Mayumi Hangai, a pediatrician who was involved in the survey, said children are resorting to abusive behavior because they do not have an outlet for their emotions under the strenuous circumstances. “Being stuck at home, children feel stress and cannot find ways to relieve it,” said Hangai. “What is significant is discussing how to address the issue together, such as preparing opportunities to listen to children’s opinions over the cancellation of club activities and school events.” (This article was written by Yukihito Takahama and Azusa Mishima.)",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14374113

"Crowds rejoice, hit streets after partial lifting of curbs",['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"June 27, 2021 at 16:07 JST"," City dwellers celebrated their first weekend in weeks of not living under a full state of emergency by hitting the streets, eating and drinking out and shopping where they pleased, things they used to take for granted. Streets in Tokyo, Osaka and other large cities were buzzing with crowds June 26 following the partial lifting of curbs in the capital and eight prefectures. Despite the seemingly relaxed atmosphere, eased precautionary restrictions remain in place for most of the prefectures. Still, for most people it was a chance to finally let their guard down, albeit slightly perhaps as just about everybody dons a face mask before venturing out. Social distancing must still be observed, which means fewer seats, tables and customers at bars, restaurants and elsewhere. Tokyo was placed under an initial 17-day state of emergency, the third to be imposed, on April 25. It was supposed to end May 11 but then extended, first to May 31 and later to June 20. Other prefectures faced similar curbs. Health experts have voiced extreme concern about people being able to mingle more freely again in public in the leadup to the Tokyo Olympics next month and growing signs that COVID-19 cases are rising in the Tokyo metropolitan area, along with the presence of more contagious coronavirus variants. But judging by the crowds of pedestrians at the iconic Scramble Crossing at 1:30 p.m. outside Tokyo's Shibuya Station, some even spilling into the road, people are fed up with repeated warnings about safety and simply wanted to have a good time. Benches set up around the nearby world-renowned Hachiko dog statue, a popular meeting spot for couples, were all occupied. A salesclerk at a clothing shop near the packed crossing was not impressed by the return of large crowds, however. “People seem to be letting down their guard,” she said. “I am really worried about a big increase in new cases.” And so, she should be. The latest weekly figure for COVID-19 cases in Tokyo already points to a rebound. Tokyo recorded 534 new cases on June 26, 146 more than a week earlier, according to the metropolitan government. The daily average of new cases over the week through June 26 marked an increase of 26 percent from the preceding week. An estimate of pedestrian flow, gleaned from locations of NTT Docomo Inc. mobile phone users, showed a sharp uptick at nine sites surveyed across the nation on June 26, compared with a week earlier. Between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. that day, 48 percent more people congregated in front of JR Osaka Station, far larger than at other sites surveyed.

2 elite METI officials held for scamming subsidy program,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"June 26, 2021 at 18:30 JST"," Two young career bureaucrats at the economy ministry are under arrest over suspicions they pocketed government funds designed for small businesses reeling from the novel coronavirus pandemic. One of them may have used the money to support an expensive lifestyle, including rent in a high-rise condominium that exceeded his monthly salary, according to investigative sources. Makoto Sakurai and Yutaro Arai were arrested June 25 on suspicion of fraud, officers of Tokyo’s Metropolitan Police Department announced the same day. The pair, both 28, were classmates in senior high school who ended up working in the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry. Sakurai joined the ministry in 2018 and Arai followed two years later. They worked in different divisions of the ministry’s Economic and Industrial Policy Bureau. Police suspect the two of abusing the program overseen by the ministry to provide rent support for small businesses and individual entrepreneurs who suffered sales losses due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the sources said. The approval process for the program may have been lax because of the need to provide financial support as quickly as possible to prevent mass bankruptcies, the sources added. According to investigative sources, the two men posed as associates of a small business from about late December and applied for the rent subsidy payments by submitting image data of fake rental agreements to the special website set up by the ministry for the program. In early January, the pair received a lump sum of about 5.5 million yen ($50,000) deposited in the company’s name. While Arai submitted the application, most of the money was grabbed by Sakurai, who, according to investigative sources, immediately purchased an expensive Swiss watch. Sakurai also owned several expensive foreign cars. Arai established a paper company in November 2019 before joining the ministry and applied for the subsidy under its name. According to the company registration, the address was registered at Arai’s residence. Arai was the founding company president, but the company is now headed by a female relative. In their application, the two claimed to use three offices with a combined rent of about 2 million yen. The actual locations were Arai’s residence, the residence of Arai’s relative and the home where Sakurai grew up. The sales record for the company was also allegedly faked because the company did not appear to conduct any sort of business. Sakurai’s colleagues at the ministry mounted their own investigation because he lived in a condominium in the posh Ichibancho district of Tokyo’s Chiyoda Ward. In a statement, the ministry issued deep regret over the matter and pledged to fully cooperate with the police investigation.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14381793

Study: Virus variants make talking up close pose higher risk,['By NAMI SUGIURA/ Staff Writer'],"June 24, 2021 at 18:45 JST"," Researchers are cautioning people about how long they converse face to face as a new study suggests coronavirus variants could transmit in a much shorter time through speech than the original virus. The study was conducted using Fugaku, the world's fastest supercomputer, by the Riken research institute, Kobe University and other universities. “People should be cautious about how long they converse,” said Makoto Tsubokura, professor of computational fluid dynamics at Kobe University, who led the Riken research team. Researchers simulated how droplets containing the coronavirus spread in two cases: when an infected person talked at a normal volume and when they spoke loudly. The infection rates for three types of the novel coronavirus were calculated based on the assumption that two of the variants studied are 1.25 times more contagious and 2.5 times more contagious, respectively, compared with the initial version of the coronavirus that raged for most of last year. The first variant was modeled after the Alpha variant, first identified in Britain, and the second was modeled after the Delta variant, which was first reported in India. The findings showed an increased risk of contracting the virus when people were just 1 meter from an infected individual who spoke loudly for 15 minutes. The researchers estimated the chances of catching the original coronavirus to be more than 20 percent, while the figure is around 30 percent for the Alpha variant and around 50 percent for the Delta virus. If people were 2 meters away, they had about a 20 percent probability of becoming infected with the Delta variant. The infection rate sharply declines for any form of the coronavirus when people kept a distance of more than 2 meters from an infected person. But people should still be careful about conversing over a prolonged period of time, even while social distancing 2 meters apart, the researchers warned. In the case of the Delta variant, the risk posed over the course of a 20-minute conversation was equivalent to those posed by the original novel coronavirus during a 60-minute chat. RISKS AT RESTAURANTS Scientists also simulated the dispersal of droplets at a small restaurant with a counter and tables where 16 people conversed and calculated the risks of contracting the virus if one of them was a carrier. With no precautionary measures in place, some of the people had a nearly 80 percent chance of getting the virus while for others it was almost zero, depending on their position in the room in relation to the infected person. People who were seated to the lee side of the air flow, which is the side sheltered from the wind, were more at risk, according to the findings. When an air conditioner was turned on, droplets containing the coronavirus dispersed more widely. But the overall risk of transmitting the virus lowered as the droplets become less concentrated. Still, the risks became much higher on the lee side of the strong air flow, the research showed. Placing panels dividing people at the counter and those seated across the table, combined with turning the air conditioner on, were found to be helpful in reducing infection risks by about 80 percent, compared with no precautions at all. Panels block droplets and air currents moving upward and downward are created when air expelled from an air conditioner hits the panels, contributing to a drop in risk, according to the research team. “It is important to prevent droplets from concentrating in a certain area and reduce the overall risks in a room,” Tsubokura said. A ceiling fan will be effective in reducing infection risks as it circulates the air upward and downward, he added.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14380232

Health experts warn virus rebound already started in Tokyo,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"June 24, 2021 at 16:52 JST"," The number of new COVID-19 cases is trending downward around the nation--but not in Tokyo, which is scheduled to host the Summer Olympics in a month. Newly confirmed infections of the novel coronavirus are “turning upward from staying flat” in Tokyo, the health ministry’s expert panel on the virus said at a meeting on June 23, three days after the COVID-19 state of emergency was lifted in the capital. “The trend (in Tokyo) is already showing signs of a rebound,” health minister Norihisa Tamura warned. According to the health ministry’s data, the number of new COVID-19 cases per 100,000 people for the latest week was 9.26 in Hokkaido, 19.36 in Yamanashi Prefecture, 7.39 in Osaka Prefecture, and 41.02 in Okinawa Prefecture, which remains under a state of emergency. In Tokyo, the number inched up to 19.70 from 19.13 recorded in the previous week. Although nighttime foot traffic in Tokyo’s downtown areas had been rising for five consecutive weeks since the end of the long holiday period in early May, the level decreased by 0.5 percent last week from the previous seven-day period. However, daytime movement of people jumped by 2.4 percent week over week. By June 21, 433 infections of L452R variants, including the Delta variant discovered in India, had been confirmed around Japan through PCR screening tests. The number doubled from 214 marked a week earlier. “In the Tokyo metropolitan area, the number of new cases has stopped falling, and particularly in Tokyo, the number of new cases has increased by about 10 percent over the past week,” Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga said at a June 23 meeting of Cabinet ministers involved in responding to the health crisis. “We need to be strongly vigilant about the rebound.” Tokyo confirmed 619 new cases on June 23, topping 600 for the first time since May 28 and showing an increase of 118 from the figure a week earlier. The number in Tokyo has been increasing for four straight days compared with week-earlier figures. The upward trend started on June 16.

Japan suspends applications for workplace vaccinations,['By JUNYA SAKAMOTO/ Staff Writer'],"June 24, 2021 at 15:20 JST"," Just five days into the rollout of its much-hyped mass vaccination campaign at workplaces and universities, the central government will suspend program applications because its supply of Moderna vaccines cannot keep up with demand. Taro Kono, state minister in charge of Japan’s COVID-19 vaccine rollout, said at a news conference on June 23 that the government will suspend new applications from companies and universities as of 5 p.m. on June 25 amid a deluge of applications. The government already stopped taking new requests for Moderna vaccines from local governments for their mass vaccination sites on June 23, Kono also disclosed. He said vaccines will still be delivered for applications that have already been filed and approved. But he did not say when the government will resume accepting new applications. “We have no choice but to run the operation for a while like (we are) closing our eyes and walking a tightrope,” Kono said. “To maintain the current capacity of inoculating as many people as possible, delivering the proper (amount of) vaccines is the most important thing,” he added, pledging that the government will do its best to make that happen. However, a Cabinet member said it will take two to three weeks to scan the remaining applications that have already been filed, which means it is unlikely the government will resume accepting new applications anytime soon. The prime minister’s office started taking applications for the vaccination program at workplaces and universities on its website on June 8. The workplace-inoculation effort started on June 21. The government has said 50 million doses of the Moderna vaccine, enough to inoculate 25 million people, will be supplied by the end of September. Kono said the government has already received applications for about 45 million doses, with 33 million requests from workplaces and universities and 12 million from local governments. That maxed out the government’s capacity for daily vaccine deliveries, Kono said.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14380073
"Opposition to Tokyo Olympics widens, but mainly online",['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"June 24, 2021 at 14:54 JST"," With just a month left to protest, around 100 people rallied in Tokyo to demand the cancellation of the Summer Olympics, a turnout that pales in comparison to opposition to the event expressed online. The demonstration was held in front of the Tokyo metropolitan government building in Shinjuku Ward on the evening of June 23, when the number of new infections of the novel coronavirus continued to resurge in the capital. Wearing masks and holding signs with anti-Olympic slogans in Japanese and English, the protesters chanted, “End the Olympic Games that destroy people’s lives.” One sign read, “Cancel the money-tainted Olympics.” Another said, “Use funds set aside for the Olympics on measures to contain the coronavirus.” The demonstration was organized by civic groups that have long opposed the Tokyo Olympic and Paralympic Games. One of the organizers said similar rallies were scheduled to be held in South Korea, Paris and Los Angeles. Another rally held nearby supported the holding of the Tokyo Olympics. “If you can gather like this, there will be no problem holding the Summer Games,” one of the supporters said. The Tokyo Olympics are scheduled to open on July 23, despite continuing health concerns about the novel coronavirus and opinion polls indicating a majority of the public wants the event postponed again or canceled. An analysis of social media data by The Asahi Shimbun using Brandwatch showed that the number of tweets and retweets with hashtags opposing the Tokyo Games, including “#This is no time to stage the Olympics,” stood at more than 97,000 between Jan. 1 and 11 a.m. on June 23. The spread of such tweets surged in the middle of this month, including more than 51,000 on June 20 alone. Mitsuko Uenishi, a professor of labor issues at Hosei University in Tokyo who advocates close scrutiny of Diet discussions, has posted eight comments on Twitter about the Olympics. In a June 21 tweet, she urged the public not to view the holding of the Tokyo Games as a “done deal.” “In mountain climbing, you must not rush to the summit, even if it is so close, once you sense danger,” she said. “There are myriad problems in holding the Olympics. Japan’s preparedness is inadequate in receiving athletes and officials from overseas and in dealing with the coronavirus. The government makes light of experts’ opinions. The problems are so obvious that I will never remain silent.” Her tweet was read by an estimated 234,000 internet users, according to the Brandwatch analysis.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14380094
2nd member of Uganda Olympic team infected with coronavirus,['By TAKUYA NISHIE/ Staff Writer'],"June 24, 2021 at 14:03 JST"," IZUMISANO, Osaka Prefecture--A second member of Uganda's Olympic delegation has tested positive for the novel coronavirus after the team was allowed to travel to its host city here despite a team coach testing positive at Narita Airport. Izumisano officials announced June 23 that a Ugandan athlete in their 20s tested positive for the virus through a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test on June 22. The coach was found to be infected after a PCR test at the airport outside Tokyo on June 19 when the team arrived in Japan. The fact that the team was permitted to leave the airport afterward has incited criticism from lawmakers and heads of local governments, questioning if the anti-virus border control measures and “bubble” promised by the Tokyo Olympics organizers to contain infections are working. Osaka Governor Hirofumi Yoshimura on June 22 said that the rest of the team “were supposed to be kept at Narita.” Izumisano Mayor Hiroyasu Chiyomatsu said that day that the airport's quarantine officers should have identified who had been in close contact with the coach at an early stage. Izumisano's prefectural health center has begun trying to determine who came into close contact with the athlete who tested positive. City officials who traveled to Narita Airport to welcome the team have been ordered to self-quarantine at home. The delegation of nine arrived at Narita on the evening of June 19. Despite all members having all their required documents and vaccination records, the coach's PCR test came back positive. The remaining eight tested negative in antigen tests, but quarantine officers did not check the members to ascertain if they had been in close contact with the coach during the long flight to Japan. The team was allowed to leave and arrived at a hotel in Izumisano, their pre-Olympic training camp site, on June 20 by chartered bus. They have been self-isolating in the hotel, subjected to daily PCR testing, according to the city. City officials announced June 22 that the eight members and a city employee who accompanied the team from Uganda were identified as having had close contact with the coach and will have their health monitored constantly until July 3.

"Letting Uganda team travel was foolhardy, say critics",['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"June 22, 2021 at 18:51 JST"," Japan’s handling of Olympic delegations arriving from overseas was brought into question after a member of Uganda’s team tested positive for COVID-19 at Narita Airport and was placed in quarantine while the other team members continued on to their training camp in Osaka Prefecture. No additional tests were performed on the remaining eight team members after they tested negative in antigen tests given at the airport outside Tokyo. Lawmakers voiced doubts about the decision not to quarantine the entire Ugandan delegation before they left the airport during a meeting with government officials on June 21. “Seeing as the other eight individuals traveled together with the person who tested positive, it is surely reasonable to assume that they were all in close contact,” said a lawmaker with the main opposition Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan who questioned the health screening setup at airports. “They should not have been allowed to leave the airport.” Hordes of Olympians, coaches and officials will descend on Tokyo next month for the Summer Games that kick off July 23. The Ugandan team arrived at Narita around 6 p.m. on June 19. All the members had documentation showing they had been fully vaccinated prior to departure and had tested negative for COVID-19. However, a coach was found to be infected after a PCR test was given at the airport. The PCR test was performed as a safeguard after an earlier antigen test did not produce a definitive result. The other delegation members tested negative in antigen tests and were not required to undergo an additional PCR test. They left the airport by chartered bus early June 20 to reach the team's training site in Izumisano city, Osaka Prefecture. Officials in Izumisano announced June 22 that the eight members and a city employee who accompanied the team from Uganda are having their health condition monitored constantly due to fears they might have been exposed to the novel coronavirus. The prefectural health center there identified them as a group at risk. So far, they have all tested negative during daily PCR tests, according to officials. Quarantine officers at Narita did not check the members to ascertain if they had been in close contact with the coach during the long flight to Japan. The team arrived at a hotel in Izumisano later that morning, having been driven nonstop. They are effectively self-isolating in the hotel, according to city officials. During the June 21 meeting, health ministry officials said the task of identifying individuals at risk of having become infected with the virus lies with local public health officials wherever team members are staying. “Local authorities are supposed to determine who has been in close contact based on information on passengers that airlines provide to the central government,” said one official. But another lawmaker took issue with the ministry’s approach, likening it to passing the buck to a public health center in a local region. In Osaka, a prefectural official expressed anger over the central government’s decision to permit the Ugandan team to leave the airport, saying it posed an unacceptable risk if the virus has already been passed to other members during the journey from the airport in Chiba Prefecture. “Since the infection of one person was confirmed at Narita Airport, the central government should have identified who were at risk of contracting the virus,” the prefectural official said. According to the health ministry, passengers seated within two rows of an infected individual during a flight are required to have their health monitored on a regular basis upon arrival in Japan. The public health center in Izumisano said identifying such individuals is possible if information is made available, such as physical distance of others who were seated close by, whether they wore masks and how long they spent chatting with the infected individual.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14378442

"Bars, customers question point of new rules on serving alcohol",['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"June 22, 2021 at 18:14 JST"," The lifting of the COVID-19 state of emergency in Tokyo allowed businesses to serve alcohol for the first time in about two months, but continued restrictions dampened the spirit of both operators and customers. In Tokyo and six prefectures where the emergency state ended on June 20, pre-emergency measures took effect the following day. In the capital, those curbs include serving only groups of one or two customers, and limiting the drinking time to less than 90 minutes. The same pre-emergency measures were also extended for the three prefectures of Saitama, Chiba and Kanagawa that neighbor Tokyo. Those affected questioned whether the measures would do anything to prevent the spread of novel coronavirus infections or how to enforce such rules. Others said the curbs have led to confusion. A woman in her 30s who was enjoying some drinks with a co-worker on a terrace table of an “izakaya” pub in the Akabane district in Tokyo’s Kita Ward, gave her opinion on the efficacy of the pre-emergency measures. “If I am asked to leave 90 minutes later, I will just find another place to drink,” she said. “It is questionable how effectively such measures can prevent the virus from spreading.” Akabane, which is filled with small drinking establishments tightly packed together, is known for places where one can “get drunk with only 1,000 yen ($9).” One izakaya in the area said that when it asked groups of three to split up, the would-be customers decided to drink elsewhere. “I am thankful that we can offer alcohol, but whether we can recover sales is unknown,” the 35-year-old manager of the izakaya said. In Saitama and Kawaguchi cities in Saitama Prefecture, customers are asked to drink alone or only with family members who live together. Around JR Kawaguchi Station, one train stop north of Akabane, a woman in her 50s visited the Kakuuchi Arai Shoten bar and also expressed doubts about the effectiveness of the rules. “If somebody wants to drink with another person, I think they will go to the nearby Akabane district,” the part-time employee said. The thirtysomething owner of an izakaya around the train station said it is difficult to know whether customers are in the same family and if they actually live together. “Honestly speaking, even if they don’t meet the requirements, it is difficult to refuse customers’ requests for alcohol,” he said. The lifting of the state of emergency allowed major izakaya operators to restart their businesses. Pub operator Kichiri & Co. had suspended operations of 50 establishments, half of its businesses, during the state of emergency. Masaki Tsunoji, a sales promotion official of the reopened Kichiri izakaya pub in Tokyo’s Shinjuku district, said, “The state of emergency that just ended should be the last one.” Restaurant operator Watami Co., Colowide Co., which runs the Amataro izakaya chain, Syoya izakaya chain operator Daisyo Corp., and British-style pub operator Hub Inc. partially restarted their businesses on June 21. Alcohol-serving restrictions differ according to area, so each izakaya chain is checking how their establishments should respond to those requirements. “Service staff shoulder a heavier burden in explaining the rules to customers, which might cause trouble,” an izakaya chain spokesman said.

Ministry urges students aged 12-15 to skip school vaccination sites,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"June 22, 2021 at 15:38 JST"," School-aged children between ages 12 and 15 should be inoculated at local clinics and not at school-wide vaccination sites to avoid peer pressure and identifying those who refuse the shots, according to education ministry guidelines. Local governments were notified of the guidelines on June 22. In May, the ministry decided to include children aged 12 to 15 in the central government’s vaccination project, which uses the Pfizer vaccine. But to prevent identifying children who refuse a vaccination, the ministry has decided not to encourage local governments to conduct a school-wide inoculation. Instead, children are urged to go to a primary care doctor or a vaccination site run by local governments. If a school decides to conduct a mass vaccination, it should be planned during a summer break and not during classes to prevent peer pressure. It has been reported that both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, which are currently used in Japan, are highly effective and safe. Initially, the Pfizer vaccine was authorized to use for people who are 16 or older. But after additional clinical trials, the vaccine is allowed to be used for those 12 or older from June. But it is believed that younger people more often tend to report experiencing pain and a fever after being inoculated. According to an interim report that surveyed about 20,000 health care workers in Japan who received a Pfizer vaccine, younger people more frequently tend to develop a fever higher than 37.5 degrees, a headache or suffer from fatigue. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), post-vaccination adverse reactions vary slightly by age group in the United States. About 10,000 people who are between 16 and 25 reported an adverse reaction. Among these, 22 percent cited dizziness, 18 percent complained of a headache, 16 percent reported a fever and 16 percent noted feeling nausea. About 1,500 children who are between 12 and 15 reported an adverse reaction. Among these, 28 percent felt dizziness, 21 percent reported fainting, 10 percent reported their skin turning pale and 9.5 percent experienced a loss of consciousness. During the same period, about 3.26 million vaccine shots were administered to children between the ages of 12 to 15. As a whole, such reports of adverse reactions are rare. The Japan Pediatric Society on June 16 released its recommendations on vaccinating children. The society said it is meaningful for children to be vaccinated. It added that it is ideal for them to be vaccinated individually under the assumption that the parents and child fully understand the pros and cons of the vaccine and that meticulous care is provided before, during and after the vaccination. “It is important to prevent an adverse reaction from occurring by offering a full pre-vaccination explanation to calm the nerves,” the society said.

Geisha facing dire straits as virus scares off Kyoto customers,['By SATOKO ONUKI/ Staff Writer'],"June 22, 2021 at 07:00 JST"," KYOTO--Geisha and their ""maiko"" trainees are being forced out of work here as the COVID-19 pandemic rages on, shutting down parties where the traditional artists make their living entertaining guests by playing music and dancing. Parties have been scrapped in all five major ""kagai"" traditional entertainment districts here, leading some of the women, collectively known as ""geimaiko,"" to quit the business. ""Last year, I made only 10 percent of my usual income. I have to dip into my savings to pay my daily expenses,"" said a geisha based in the Kamishichiken district. The number of geisha parties declined sharply due to the first state of emergency issued in spring 2020 and during the third state of emergency that ended on June 20, almost no parties were held. While maiko trainees are postponing their debuts, some geimaiko have chosen to leave the kagai districts, citing drastically reduced incomes and uncertainty about the future. The number of geisha, called ""geiko"" in Kyoto, working in the five districts fell from 169 in March 2020 to 161 in March 2021, while the number of maiko declined from 81 to 68, according to the Kyoto Traditional Art Foundation, a public interest foundation working to preserve and pass down the kagai district culture. According to insiders, an increasing number of ""shikomi-san"" (prospective trainees) have also postponed their maiko debuts. ""With no geisha parties being held due to the coronavirus, some geiko have quit, saying that they didn't know what to expect in the future,"" said the Kamishichiken-based geiko. Usually, she would find her appointment book filled with party dates between March and April, largely thanks to a series of ""Kitano Odori"" dance performances. But the spring tradition has been canceled for two straight years now. She also canceled her dance and music lessons to avoid close contact with others. ""I had always worn kimono every day for lessons and parties ever since I was a 'shikomi' after graduating from high school, but it is my first year not wearing kimono on so many occasions,"" she said with a wry smile. While the kagai districts continue to be in dire straits, geisha are the ones hit hardest by the pandemic. While they work as maiko, their rents, groceries and other living expenses are shouldered by ""okiya"" geisha lodging houses. But when they go independent as geiko, they become self-employed and their main source of income are ""hanadai"" party fees that their clients pay them, which have evaporated due to the lack of parties. Teahouse associations have made various efforts to provide support for geiko, helping them apply for government pandemic relief money and setting up a no-interest loan program. The Kyoto Traditional Art Foundation also provided financial support to teahouse associations in April 2020 and again in January this year so that each geimaiko could receive a total of 120,000 yen ($1,100) in a lump-sum payment. But many geiko are still suffering from financial difficulties because they are not eligible for compensation or other support for restaurant operators. ""Teahouses can receive government support money each day because they are restaurants, but there is no compensation for geiko to support their daily living,"" said Saburo Nakanishi, a board member of the teahouse association for the Gion-Higashi district. Nor can the women turn to husbands for support during the current lean times. In Kyoto's geisha districts, it is a long-standing tradition for geimaiko to retire when they marry. For that reason, many geiko are living alone to keep their jobs. ""We don't know when this situation will come to an end,"" said a geiko working in the Pontocho district who performs under the name Ichiwaka . ""I become nervous when I'm all alone in my room with no lessons and parties to give."" A geiko named Momino, who heads an association for geiko working in Pontocho, said she also has a lot of concerns about life after the pandemic. ""I'm not sure whether we can present the same Kamogawa Odori performance as before because we have a lower number of geimaiko. Parties are all about opening up with each other and becoming close to one another by drinking together, but we may have to come up with new ways of entertaining guests,"" she said.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14366877

PCR testing on sewage water from offices for early discovery,['By KAZUHITO SUWA/ Staff Writer'],"June 21, 2021 at 08:00 JST"," KYOTO--A subsidiary of precision equipment maker Shimadzu Corp. is offering to perform polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests on raw sewage running from buildings to more quickly track locations where the novel coronavirus is present. As the virus that causes COVID-19 is known to exist in the feces of infected individuals before they develop symptoms, the company said it can identify likely problem locations through sewage checks. Shimadzu Techno-Research Inc. recommends that all users of targeted buildings be checked at a medical institution if sewage water tests prove positive. The company said its method is a cheaper and more efficient way to locate infected individuals compared with conducting mass testing at the start. The service involves company personnel placing absorbent cotton wrapped in netting down sewage manholes within the premises of a client's building for 24 hours before conducting PCR tests on the absorbed water. It said results would be known a few days after collection. Regular testing would result in earlier discovery, the company said. Shimadzu Techno-Research recommended that facilities for the elderly, schools and accommodation facilities use its service. The company charges a basic service fee of 70,000 yen ($640) each time it is called in. It also charges for transportation at the time of collecting samples and other fees. The two-step testing, which the company calls the “Kyoto model,” has already received nearly 100 inquiries from across the nation, the company said.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14369972

Koike puts kibosh on public viewing events during Olympics,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"June 19, 2021 at 18:56 JST"," Taking note of calls by health experts dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic, Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike announced June 19 that all plans by the metropolitan government to organize public viewing events during the Olympics would be canceled. Initially, the metropolitan government had planned to hold public viewing events at six locations in the capital, including Yoyogi Park, Inokashira Park, Hibiya Park and Ueno Park. The proposal submitted June 18 by experts, including some on the panel advising the government on steps to combat the health crisis, called for cancelling the events designed mainly to cheer on athletes outside of sports venues. Experts said the events would result in large numbers of people congregating, adding to the risk of spreading infections. The metropolitan government announced earlier that the Yoyogi Park site would instead be used as a mass COVID-19 vaccination center. Koike said June 19 that a similar plan is now in the works for Inokashira Park. In place of the public viewing events, the metropolitan government will consider ways of using the internet to generate enthusiasm for the Olympics while the Games are on. Prior to meeting with reporters to make her announcement, Koike met with Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga for about an hour. She explained that they discussed a planned meeting on June 21 to decide how many spectators to allow in for Olympic events as well as the COVID-19 infection situation in Tokyo. “I believe various measures are needed (such as cancelling public viewing) in order to ensure the Tokyo Olympics are a success,” Koike told reporters. “I also gained the understanding of the prime minister.”",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14376644
Ball now in Suga’s court on issue of fans in Olympic stands,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"June 19, 2021 at 15:28 JST"," The message from a group of top health experts could not be clearer: For safety's sake, don't allow spectators at the Tokyo Olympics due to start late next month. Now, it is up to the government to decide whether to heed this advice, even as pre-emergency steps are scheduled to replace a months-long state of emergency that will expire on June 20. The proposal submitted June 18 by the experts starkly spelled out a preference for not allowing any spectators at the Games that kick off July 23. The central government and Olympic organizing committee must now grapple with how many, if any, spectators can attend the various Olympic events. The sports extravaganza has already been delayed by a year because of the health crisis. The scale of pedestrian traffic during an Olympics goes well beyond what occurs during professional baseball and soccer games. The largest number of tickets sold for a single day for events to be held in Tokyo and its three neighboring prefectures already stands at about 430,000. In comparison, baseball stadiums in the four prefectures on average attract 47,000 or so fans a day, while the J.League has about 7,000 fans in the four prefectures on a typical day. The proposal submitted by Shigeru Omi, chairman of the panel of experts advising the government on the novel coronavirus pandemic, and other health experts cited the increased flow of people during the Olympics as representing a major risk for spreading infections. The proposal was submitted less than 24 hours after Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga expressed his intention to allow fans to the Olympic events. However, a close associate of Suga clearly took the experts’ proposal to heart, noting that “it is based on scientific knowledge, so spectators should not be allowed in.” Ignoring the recommendations of experts badly hurt the Suga Cabinet's standing in public opinion polls last autumn during the third wave of COVID-19 cases. The administration pushed ahead with its ""Go To Travel"" tourism promotion campaign and the ensuing surge in new COVID-19 cases resulted in  plunging approval ratings for the Suga Cabinet. There are already signs in Tokyo of a fifth wave of infections. A similar surge of cases due to greater pedestrian traffic during the Olympics prompted  one executive of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party to say, “The prime minister will have to assume the political responsibility.” While polls have consistently shown that 70 percent of the public is against holding the Olympics while the pandemic is raging, Suga has clung to the view that a successful outcome would bolster the LDP’s chances in the Lower House election that must be held this autumn. He and other LDP lawmakers still favor spectators in the stands for Olympic events, if for no other reason than the positive impact that would have on the economy. But with pre-emergency curbs to be implemented for Tokyo from June 21 until July 11, there are growing concerns about what should be done in the event those measures have to be extended until the Olympics. “If those measures cannot be lifted (in time for the Olympics), the option of no fans in the stands cannot be dismissed,” said one high-ranking government source. The general consensus is that a difficult political decision will have to be made regarding the spectator issue. An online meeting involving representatives of the central and Tokyo metropolitan governments, the Tokyo Olympic organizing committee as well as the International Olympic Committee and International Paralympic Committee will be held June 21 to decide how many spectators to allow. The organizing committee’s own roundtable of experts dealing with the pandemic met June 18 after receiving the proposal from Omi and agreed that a flexible approach was needed that could allow for changes to how many spectators are allowed depending on the level of new COVID-19 cases. Some of the experts who joined in submitting the proposal admitted that their gut feeling was for no spectators at the Olympics. “Our fundamental stance from the start was ‘no spectators,’” one expert said. “But the proposal would not have been accepted if we said that, so we also included the conditions that would have to be met in order to allow in some fans.” Criticism was also raised that the proposal came too late, as government officials were already talking about allowing spectators. Omi explained at the June 18 news conference that many of the experts wanted to present the proposal only after considering the latest data about new COVID-19 cases.

Doubts cast on sports agency’s purchase of air cleaners,['By SEIICHIRO KUCHIKI/ Staff Writer'],"June 15, 2021 at 08:00 JST"," The Japan Sports Agency is under fire for purchasing air cleaning equipment for the Tokyo Olympics that has no proven effectiveness in reducing airborne viruses. The agency bought the equipment in the hope that its use at meeting rooms and other areas in the National Stadium in Tokyo, where the Opening and Closing Olympic ceremonies are due to be held, would help keep staff members and others safe from novel coronavirus infection. But experts took issue with the JSA because the purchase could be taken to show the technology has the full endorsement of the government. Manufacturers of such appliances are not permitted under the drug and medical equipment law to promote such devices as helpful in combating viral infections. “The purchase presents a problem because it sounds as if the technology has obtained the full endorsement of the government,” said Narumi Hori, a nurse who offers consultation services to stop infectious diseases from spreading. “I would advise the agency to take appropriate steps without being deceived by suppliers’ advertisements.” Hori accused manufacturers of playing on the public's fears about becoming infected. “They are spurring consumers’ fears,” she said. “They are only adding to the burden on people and society, and as such, their behavior is entirely inappropriate.” The agency said it initially considered purchasing robotic anti-virus equipment that uses artificial intelligence (AI) to purify the air, but dropped the plan in light of objections from the health ministry. The ministry’s only recommended method to keep airborne viruses at bay is “frequent ventilation.” “We didn't research air sterilization technology properly,” conceded an agency representative in reference to earlier plans to snap up AI robotic technology. However, it went ahead with the purchase of atmospheric purifiers billed as having the ability to disinfect the air under the rationale that “ventilating venues as much as possible” presented a viable option. The agency allocated 2 billion yen ($18.3 million) in the third supplementary budget last fiscal year for “steps against the novel coronavirus infection at the National Stadium and elsewhere.” The “air disinfection” technology was included in the funding plan. The budget is aimed partly to ensure there will be a sufficient number of air cleaners at the National Stadium to keep people safe.

Kawasaki city said it will use spare doses to avoid a delay in the schedule of its vaccination program. The vaccine used by the city was developed by U.S. pharmaceutical company Pfizer Inc. and German partner BioNTech, and it must be stored in temperatures of minus 60 to minus 90 degrees. A city official visiting a storage site for vaccine doses in the city heard an alarm blaring from the freezer in question at 8:10 a.m. on June 13, according to the city government. Records show the temperature inside the freezer rose to minus 59.6 degrees at 2:08 p.m. on June 11 and hit 9.1 degrees at 2:53 p.m. the following day, the city said. The temperature then began dropping and reached minus 15.2 degrees at 5:05 a.m. on June 13.

"Quasi-emergency to end in Gunma, Ishikawa and Kumamoto",['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"June 11, 2021 at 17:30 JST"," Quasi-emergency measures will be lifted for Gunma, Ishikawa and Kumamoto prefectures after June 13 although authorities will ask restaurants and bars in some areas to continue to close earlier. The government’s task force team on June 10 approved the lifting of the pre-emergency measures for the three prefectures as COVID-19 cases continue falling there. The three prefectures will not ask eating and drinking establishments to refrain from serving alcohol, but will continue to request those in many areas to reduce their operating hours. At a task force meeting on June 10, Gunma prefectural officials decided to maintain the highest level of the local alert system from June 14 to 20. It will also continue to ask all restaurants and bars in the prefecture to close by 8 p.m. Under the quasi-emergency measures, eating and drinking establishments in 10 municipalities, including Maebashi and Takasaki cities, have been asked not to serve alcohol the entire day. From June 14, they will be able to offer alcoholic beverages until 7 p.m. “We would like to prevent a rebound in cases,” Gunma Governor Ichita Yamamoto said at a news conference on June 10. “We would like to restart economic activities cautiously and gradually.” At a meeting on June 9, Ishikawa Governor Masanori Tanimoto told people associated with a shopping street in Kanazawa city that he knows the quasi-emergency measures have been difficult for businesses. “I think that they have been extremely tough, but the infection situation is improving,” Tanimoto said. The governor has been asking restaurants and bars in the prefecture to close by 9 p.m., and requesting those in Kanazawa city to close by 8 p.m. and to stop serving alcohol as the prefecture’s capital has recorded nearly half of the local infection cases. But after the quasi-emergency measures are lifted, the prefectural government will not ask restaurants and bars in Kanazawa city to stop offering alcoholic beverages. It will also not urge these establishments in the prefecture, except in Kanazawa city, to close early. At a news conference on June 10, Kumamoto Governor Ikuo Kabashima announced his plan to ask only eating and drinking establishments that serve alcohol in Kumamoto city to close by 9 p.m. until June 30. Those establishments have been asked to close by 8 p.m. The prefectural government will stop asking restaurants and bars in Kumamoto city to refrain from serving alcohol and cancel the request for those in the prefecture, except Kumamoto city, to close by 9 p.m. after the measures end on June 13. “If anti-coronavirus measures are relaxed and social and economic activities become more active, then infections could spread again,” Kabashima warned.

"Quasi-emergency needed in Osaka after June 20, governor says",['By YUKI KUBOTA/ Staff Writer'],"June 11, 2021 at 14:55 JST"," OSAKA--Osaka Governor Hirofumi Yoshimura believes quasi-emergency measures should remain in place to deal with the novel coronavirus pandemic even after the state of emergency is lifted on the June 20 deadline. In an exclusive interview with The Asahi Shimbun, Yoshimura reflected on the haste at which infection prevention measures were relaxed soon after the second state of emergency and blamed that move for the sudden surge in COVID-19 cases from late March. “Rather than return to a normal situation (after the state of emergency is lifted), I believe quasi-emergency measures should be in place,” Yoshimura said. He said the Osaka prefectural government was considering asking the central government to implement quasi-emergency measures once the state of emergency is lifted. After the second state of emergency was lifted on March 1, the Osaka prefectural government ended its request for bars and restaurants to voluntarily shorten their business hours in areas outside Osaka city. But that move, combined with the approach of spring vacation for students and a period of personnel transfers at companies in late March and early April led to a sharp increase in pedestrian traffic. That, in turn, caused a spike in novel coronavirus infections from late March and from April 13, Osaka Prefecture recorded more than 1,000 new cases daily. That put a tremendous strain on the medical care system and from late April until early May only about 10 percent of those recuperating at home or other accommodations were able to enter hospitals for treatment. The Osaka prefectural government has labeled the period after March 1 the fourth wave of infections. By June 9, Osaka had logged 1,367 deaths from COVID-19, the largest number for a prefecture in Japan. Osaka accounted for about 20 percent of the 5,956 total fatalities during that period. The Osaka prefectural government established its own standards for deciding whether to ask the central government to lift the state of emergency in March. But Yoshimura said partly due to his own insufficient explanation of what those standards meant, “A belief emerged among Osaka residents that they would be able to (move around more freely).” The most dangerous time for a prefecture is when the mood in society is that “everything is all right,"" he added. ""But it is difficult to stop such thinking from emerging.” Based on that experience, Yoshimura said there was a need to have a common understanding among Osaka residents that infection prevention measures would only gradually be relaxed. That meant the quasi-emergency measures were needed, he added. Such measures were implemented in Osaka from April 5 and bars and restaurants in Osaka city were asked to close at 8 p.m. while other establishments in the prefecture were asked to shut down at 9 p.m. After the third state of emergency was implemented from April 25, it took about two weeks for COVID-19 numbers to drop in Osaka. While the numbers have fallen under 200 per day since June 4, Yoshimura raised more concerns about the mutant coronavirus strain first found in India. He said caution had to be exercised from mid- to late-July as students will enter their summer vacation breaks and there would be more movement among families and young people. “If the India strain should spread during that period, we could end up with the same situation (as the fourth wave),” Yoshimura said. “I feel there is the possibility of a fifth wave at that time because vaccines will still not have reached a large portion of the population.”",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14370719

"Chiba, Saitama, Skytree drop out of public Olympic viewing events",['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"June 10, 2021 at 18:59 JST"," With the start of the Tokyo Olympics six weeks away, public viewing events are falling by the wayside due to COVID-19 concerns, with gatherings in two neighboring prefectures and at the tallest structure in the capital called off. Chiba Governor Toshihito Kumagai on June 10 briefed reporters on the decision to scrap events in his prefecture. “The purpose of holding the viewing events was to share the inspiration and excitement of the Games and promote the appeal of the prefecture,” he said. “But in the midst of novel coronavirus infections spreading, such a purpose will be unachievable. From the standpoint of controlling the costs, I thought a decision needed to be made quickly.” According to the prefectural government, public viewing events were scheduled for Makuhari Kaihin Park in Chiba’s Mihama Ward on July 31 and Aug. 1 for Olympic events, as well as on Aug. 28 and 29 for Paralympic events. As many as 3,000 people were expected to watch the Games live on a large LCD screen, the city said. On-stage performances by elementary and junior high school children were planned, while neighboring municipalities hoped to hold promotional events for local products. The prefectural government budgeted 90 million yen ($822,000) for staging the events. Kumagai followed Saitama Governor Motohiro Ono, who announced the cancellation of Olympic-related events in his prefecture just days earlier. Ono said at a news conference on June 7 that the public viewing events that the prefectural government had planned were called off. “It is very sad, but I made the decision as the host,” Ono said. Viewing events were scheduled at Sonic City in Saitama’s Omiya Ward from July 31 to Aug. 8, as well as at a public sports complex in the city of Asaka from Aug. 28 to Sept. 5. The prefectural government estimated about 11,000 visitors would be drawn to the two sites. Meanwhile, Tokyo lost another iconic landmark from the venues hosting public viewing events. Tokyo’s Sumida Ward on June 8 announced the cancellation of viewing events scheduled at Tokyo Skytree Town, the tallest structure in Japan, at 634 meters. The ward office said it made the decision to “prioritize the residents’ health and safety.” Shigeru Omi, the head of a government pandemic-response panel, on June 9 said in a Lower House committee meeting that public viewing events should not be held. “There are other ways to cheer on (the athletes),” Omi said, adding that through TV and other means he hopes people find a new way of enjoying the Games together. Facing strong criticism, the Tokyo metropolitan government on June 1 canceled plans to use Yoyogi Park for viewing events during the Olympics, but not for five other locations.

Municipalities get angry calls for offering jabs to teenagers,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"June 10, 2021 at 18:51 JST"," INE, Kyoto Prefecture--This small town has been flooded with phone calls from around Japan questioning the decision by officials here to inoculate teenagers against the novel coronavirus. Town officials contacted the police following one phone call that they deemed a death threat. Ine, with a population of about 2,000, began vaccinating students aged 12 to 15 on June 6 after the health ministry added the age group to the list of those eligible for free access to the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. But the town’s call center dealing with the vaccination schedule has been inundated with phone calls assailing giving a jab to junior high school and other students since June 7, when the news media reported on the town's program. The call center was forced to shut down 30 minutes after opening at 9 a.m. that day. Town officials said that they received about 110 phone calls, 36 emails and eight faxed texts from across Japan by late at night on June 7. Many of them were inquiring if it was safe to immunize children, officials said. But some equated vaccinating children with murder. An official in charge of the vaccination program blamed the reaction on a lack of understanding about the health ministry's expanded eligibility for receiving jabs. The town initially planned to vaccinate students across the board, but it has now changed its policy to inoculate only students who wished to receive the shots and whose parents gave consent. The shift, following numerous calls and emails raising doubts about immunizing the youth, is intended to make it clear that students are receiving shots out of their own choice. About 50 residents in Ine are aged 12-15. The town began rolling out a vaccine to residents aged 16 through 64 from May 30, after starting with vaccinations of people aged 65 or older. Strong reactions against inoculating young students have taken place in other municipalities as well. Komaki city and Togo town in Aichi Prefecture were met with protests calling for a halt when they announced prioritized vaccination of junior and high school students. Komaki had received 30 calls and 20 emails as of June 9, two days after the city announced the plan to give inoculations to students. Officials said most of those calls and emails came from outside the city, including from Tokyo and Nagano Prefecture. Officials will allow students to get vaccinated only after they and their parents give consent. The Togo town hall had received more than 100 calls in protest by June 9, after officials said June 4 they would send a vaccination coupon to third-year high school students as a priority. The callers either questioned the soundness of inoculating teenagers or criticized vaccinating them as they are less likely to develop serious symptoms if they catch the virus. Okushiri, an island in Hokkaido, is also experiencing a backlash from the public following the town government’s announcement to inoculate high school students who wish to get the shots from as early as late June. Tetsushi Yoshikawa, professor of pediatrics at Fujita Health University in Aichi Prefecture, underscored the significance of inoculating children. “Children aged 12 to 15 also need to be given a jab,” he said. “If they are vaccinated, they could avoid class or school closures.” He also said doctors should fully inform teenagers who are considering getting a shot about the vaccines before allowing them to get one.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14369992
School activities? Nope. Olympic event at leprosy center? A-OK,['By MAYUMI UJIOKA/ Senior Staff Writer'],"June 10, 2021 at 18:40 JST"," A city in western Tokyo is giving pandemic-frustrated children a chance to release pent-up enthusiasm and stifled excitement by attending an Olympic torch relay ceremony held at a sanitarium for leprosy patients. Schoolchildren in Higashimurayama city have seen many of their school activities canceled as a precaution against the spread of the novel coronavirus in the capital. But city officials have asked children at elementary and junior high schools to join the ceremony to welcome the Olympic torch’s arrival on the evening of July 13. Bewildered teachers and parents questioned the city’s decision. “Why in the world is there an exception in the case of the Olympics?” one of them asked. City officials have insisted that attendance “is not mandatory.” The torch ceremony will be held at Tama Zenshoen, a national sanitarium for leprosy patients, which has suspended annual visits of school children to avoid the risk of novel coronavirus infections. The event is being hosted by the Tokyo Organizing Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games and is scheduled to start at 4:30 p.m. and end at 7:30 p.m. Under the city’s initial plan, 2,000 to 3,000 schoolchildren would attend the Olympic torch ceremony. But the COVID-19 pandemic prompted the city to halve the number of attendees. On May 31, the principals of 22 elementary and junior high schools in the city received a request from the Higashimurayama government to each select two children and their parents or guardians to attend the event. The city explained that the ceremony will provide an opportunity for children “to welcome the torch’s arrival together, deliver smiles and think about the importance of human rights and the realization of an inclusive society.” But many principals were not comfortable with the explanation. A principal of a junior high school said discussions among educators about the invitation were like: “It’s difficult. What should I do? What will you do?” The principal decided to let all of the school’s students know about the invitation because  “some parents and students might be willing to attend because it is a once-in-a-lifetime event.” Noting that the torch ceremony falls under the “after-school activity” category, the principal said, “Attend or not to attend, it is up to the parents to decide.” So far, 18 people at the school said they wanted to attend. The principal said there will be a lottery to select the attendees. Another school, using email, only notified parents of sixth-graders about the city’s invitation. According to a school representative, the email said: “This request came from the city. It is the parents’ choice to attend the event or not. The school has nothing to do with it.” The school recently selected attendees in a drawing. Another principal of an elementary school said the school has declined the invitation. “Initially, we thought we had to select attendees,” the principal said. “But then we heard from the city that it is not mandatory. We saw a risk of infections, as well as a problem in the selection process. After discussing the matter with teachers, we declined.” Parents and teachers have also raised questions about the city’s decision. A 38-year-old woman said her child’s elementary school has canceled or suspended many school activities out of safety concerns. “It doesn ’t make sense that only the torch relay event gets the OK,” she said. She also expressed fears that the virus could spread during the torch welcoming ceremony. “What happens if it becomes an infection cluster? They can’t just say, ‘We don’t know,’ because they are calling for participants through the schools.” Another mother, 34, whose child attends a junior high school in the city, expressed mixed feelings. “My child wants to go, but I don’t know what kind of event it will be. I am worried that the bus going home will be really packed,” she said. Hiromichi Miyazawa, who teaches at a public elementary school in Higashimurayama, said, “The city has yet to tell schools about safety measures, so I cannot assume responsibility as a teacher who has the children’s lives in my hands.” As a school activity, students in the higher grades at Miyazawa’s school visit Tama Zenshoen to learn about human rights issues by listening to people who have recovered from leprosy. But in the past year or so, the sanitarium has had to suspend such visits because of the pandemic. “We have canceled traveling classes, social studies field trips and excursions, keeping children from participating in many activities,” Miyazawa said. “How can we tell them that we’ll make an exception, just this once, for the Olympic torch event?” A city official insisted that COVID-19 preventive measures will be in place at the ceremony, such as asking attendees to wear masks, use hand sanitizers and have their body temperatures checked. “If many parents are worried and nobody wants to attend, then it is not an obligation for schools to select attendees,” the official said.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14369897
"Up to 68,000 Olympic fans a day expected at waterfront area",['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"June 10, 2021 at 17:59 JST"," Up to 68,000 spectators a day would crowd Tokyo’s Olympic-themed waterfront area if their numbers are limited to 5,000 for each competition venue during the Summer Games, an Asahi Shimbun study showed. The estimate does not include visitors without tickets who may visit the area, which has been designed to provide an “Olympic experience” for all people. Seven competition venues are located within a 1.5-kilometer radius in the waterfront area of Koto Ward. Olympic organizers and government officials have yet to decide on whether the Summer Games will be staged with spectators during the continuing novel coronavirus pandemic. Overseas spectators have already been barred from attending. Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga wants audiences in the stands at the Games, according to officials with the Tokyo Olympic organizing committee. Health experts, however, said that if fans can attend the events, there should be a cap on their numbers for each venue. Government officials are expected to decide on the spectator issue by June 20, when the COVID-19 state of emergency is scheduled to be lifted for Tokyo and nine prefectures. Under the state of emergency, sports and other events have been held with spectators based on the rule that only 50 percent of the venue can be filled, and the number of people must not exceed 5,000. If a similar rule is used for the Summer Olympics, a maximum total of more than 3 million people are expected to attend the events, excluding the marathons and track and field competitions, according to the Asahi calculations. The crowd estimate was based on the competition schedule and the capacity of each venue published by the Tokyo Olympic organizing committee. Competitions will be held in the capital and nine other prefectures over 19 days. The calculations showed that up to 68,000 spectators will attend competition events at the seven venues in the waterfront area on July 25, the first Sunday after the Opening Ceremony on July 23. Overall, around 700,000 people are projected to show up at the seven venues during the Games through Aug. 8. However, many more are expected to visit the area, which the International Olympic Committee and other organizers named “Tokyo Waterfront City.” It was set up under the concept of fusing a city and sports and to give visitors without tickets an Olympic experience. An Olympic flame cauldron, separate from the one at the National Stadium, the main Olympic venue, will be placed on the Dream Bridge connecting the Ariake and Odaiba districts in the area. The area also features a recreational walking path of about 2 km, a zone for skateboarding and 3x3 basketball, which will make their debuts as Olympic sports in Tokyo, pavilions of official sponsors, and a large shop selling Olympic-related goods. Before the pandemic, the Odaiba Marine Park on the waterfront was visited by fewer than 10,000 people a day in July, according to park managers. Officials at the organizing committee and the Tokyo metropolitan government are working on measures to prevent congestion there during the Olympics. But their policy to open the area to the general public remains in place. Details of the measures are expected to be announced later. Tetsuya Matsumoto, a professor of infectious diseases at the International University of Health and Welfare, stressed the urgency of restricting crowd sizes at places where people will likely gather, saying spectators from all over Japan will come to Tokyo during the Games. “If spectators go straight home after watching the competitions, they will be less likely to impose risks in terms of transmitting the virus,” he said. “But the Olympic Games are, simply put, a ‘festival.’ They will tend to linger in the waterfront area if various events by official sponsors are staged. If other crowds join, the infection risk will heighten.” Shigeru Omi, chairman of the government’s expert panel responding to the pandemic, and his colleagues will soon issue a report on the assessment of the infection risks in Tokyo when the Olympics and Paralympics are held and measures to reduce the risks.

Suga sets goal of finishing COVID-19 vaccinations by November,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"June 10, 2021 at 14:36 JST"," Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga said he aims to finish inoculating all citizens who want to be vaccinated against the novel coronavirus by October or November to contain the COVID-19 pandemic. He announced the goal June 9 during his first one-on-one Diet debate with leaders of the opposition camp. It was the first to be held in two years. The debate centered on steps the government is taking to bring the COVID-19 pandemic under control and whether Japan should press ahead with the Olympic Games scheduled to start in late July. Yukio Edano, leader of the main opposition Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan, pointed out that the current COVID-19 state of emergency was repeatedly extended due to a resurgence of infections. “It was too early to lift the previous emergency declaration in March,” Edano told Suga. “A fifth wave of infections must be prevented at all costs. You should present clear and strict criteria (for lifting the state of emergency).” Suga responded that progress in the vaccination program holds the key to controlling infections, noting that nearly 20 million doses had been administered already. “I want to finish inoculating all those who need or want to be vaccinated by October or November,” he said. With regard to the Olympics, Suga vowed that the government will take all possible steps to prevent a spread of infections by capping the number of athletes and staff who attend and monitoring the movements of the foreign media using GPS devices. “I want to show that the world can overcome the coronavirus by fighting as one,” he said, renewing his resolve to stage the sports extravaganza, already delayed by one year due to the pandemic. However, Suga rejected opposition parties’ demands for a supplementary budget to fund anti-virus measures and an extension of the ordinary session of the Diet that ends June 16. In response, the CDP, the Japanese Communist Party, the Democratic Party for the People and the Social Democratic Party began preparing to submit a no-confidence motion against the Suga Cabinet.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14369771

Tokyo police and firefighters get jabs at ex-Tsukiji fish market site,['By MOMOKO IKEGAMI/ Staff Writer'],"June 9, 2021 at 18:36 JST"," The Tokyo metropolitan government on June 8 started mass vaccinations for police officers and firefighters at the former Tsukiji fish market site in the capital’s Chuo Ward. The metropolitan government plans to open similar mass vaccination sites in five other locations, hoping to inoculate every Tokyo resident who wants to receive a shot by the end of the year. About 3,000 employees of the Metropolitan Police Department and the Tokyo Fire Department received a shot of COVID-19 vaccine on the first day. Their body temperatures were checked in a tent set up at the outdoor site and aft er physicians interviewed them about their health inside a prefabricated facility, they were guided to one of the 15 booths to get a shot administered by nurses. To secure enough health care workers to administer the vaccine, the metropolitan government enlisted nurses who have been off work due to child-rearing and other reasons, as well as dentists who have been trained to administer an intramuscular injection. The metropolitan government initially expected to administer the vaccine at the site to 52,000 MPD employees and 5,000 TFD employees, but it has expanded the eligibility to include members of fire companies, veterinarians, acupuncturists and judo therapists. Officials plan to administer the first of two shots for 5,000 people per day, and 110,000 people in total, at the Tsukiji site by June 30. Afterward, the site will be used as a base for vehicles that will transport athletes and officials during the Tokyo Olympics. For the second shot, the metropolitan government will use Yoyogi Park in Shibuya Ward. Officials hope to administer the vaccine to 5,000 people every day and up to 25,000 people per day at the five sites that will be newly established for mass vaccinations, which include one in the western Tama area, they said. In addition to the metropolitan government, multiple organizations--city and ward offices, the Self-Defense Forces and large-scale companies--are running a mass vaccination program in Tokyo. Each program has different eligibility rules for people to receive the vaccine such as occupation and age.

An estimated 2,000 Kurdish people live in Kawaguchi, just north of Tokyo, and the neighboring city of Warabi. Many have not registered their residencies with the city government because they are seeking recognition from immigration authorities as refugees.

Companies rush to set up in-house vaccination programs,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"June 9, 2021 at 16:47 JST"," Companies across Japan rushed to apply to set up vaccination programs for employees at their workplaces after the government gave the green light June 8 for them to do so. But many others wavered as they considered the practicalities of what would be involved. Applications were submitted by companies and universities for approval to set up more than 500 sites at workplaces and campuses. The program is scheduled to begin June 21. Many companies are concerned about whether they can secure enough medical staff for the vaccinations and if it is OK to inoculate their employees ahead of elderly local residents. Companies and universities can apply for the workplace vaccination program after they decide the procedures and rules to provide inoculations. The government anticipates this will be done in three ways: vaccinating at clinics within companies; asking medical personnel to visit and provide vaccinations; and sending employees to medical institutions. Companies and universities will receive vaccines, syringes and equipment to store the vials at low temperatures to start giving inoculations as early as June 21. East Japan Railway Co. was one of the companies that applied for the program on June 8. “To operate our railway services in a stable manner, it is essential that we start the vaccination rollout as early as possible,” Yuji Fukasawa, the president of JR East, said at a news conference. The company said it will implement the program at two facilities in Tokyo and Sendai. It plans to finish the vaccination rollout this year for 22,000 employees, such as station staff, signal operators and maintenance workers. Softbank Corp. also applied to vaccinate about 100,000 people, including employees, their family members and mobile phone sales agents. The mobile carrier giant said that it had already secured the services of 40 or so doctors and nurses. Rakuten Group Inc., Nomura Holdings Inc., BicCamera Inc., Iris Ohyama Inc. and Sompo Japan Insurance Inc. were among other large companies that applied for the workplace vaccination program the same day. Sompo Japan said it had not yet determined the priority order for its employees. “This is a race against the clock, so we should think about it while we are running,” said Kengo Sakurada, the president of the parent company Sompo Holdings Inc. Many companies did not apply for the program, however. Toyota Motor Corp., Honda Motor Co. and Nissan Motor Co., are planning to follow suit but did not apply on June 8. “There are too many things to decide, so we failed to apply in time,” said a representative of a large corporation.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14368937
Student to sue university for only offering online courses,['By YURI MURAKAMI/ Staff Writer'],"June 9, 2021 at 16:10 JST"," Fed up with only being offered online courses due to the novel coronavirus pandemic, a university student is planning to sue the institution for the return of school fees. The student, who is 19, accused Meisei University of not fulfilling its obligation to offer face-to-face learning opportunities for more than a year. He entered the university in Hino, western Tokyo, in April 2020 to study business administration to equip him with the skills to run his own company in the future. His first disappointment came when the university canceled its entrance ceremony to welcome new students. The next blow came when the department of business administration decided to offer only online courses for all of fiscal 2020. In most cases, students were asked to watch a lecture video that had been recorded beforehand and submit a report. “I saw professors only through a computer screen,” he said. “There was no opportunity to make friends to talk to and ask questions from the classes. I felt lonely.” He contends the university did not adequately explain its decision to continue online courses, and said that created a sense of distrust. Frustrated by the situation, he decided to sue the university. His 70-year-old father encouraged him to pursue the matter if the university continued to handle the matter in an irrational way, he said. In prepared legal documents, the student pointed out that the education ministry in July and September 2020 asked universities to explain being unable to offer face-to-face instruction and urged them to set up opportunities for students and professors to mingle. But Meisei University acted “against the ministry’s request” and failed to fulfill its contractual obligation to let students use its facilities, he argued. He is expected to demand 1.4 million yen ($12,800) in compensation, which includes part of the tuition. “Many students are concerned and questioning the university's decision to continue online courses without giving the issue careful consideration,” he said. “Somebody needs to say something about it.” A university representative said that all departments had offered only courses online since spring last year. Starting from last fall, some courses returned to a face-to-face format, but the business administration department stuck to online courses throughout the last fiscal year. The guidelines were posted on the portal website for students and the university’s website, the representative said. Freshman in the business administration department had two opportunities, September 2020 and March this year, to mingle with each other, as well as senior students and professors, the representative said. The representative declined to comment on the student’s plan to file a lawsuit. A survey by the education ministry found that as of last October, 187 schools including universities and polytechnics said face-to-face courses constituted less than half of the all those offered. Eighteen of those schools said that “Almost all of the students understood and accepted the formats of courses.”",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14368916

Top Japanese virologist warns of risks of Tokyo Games during pandemic--paper,['REUTERS'],"June 8, 2021 at 14:51 JST"," A top Japanese virologist and government adviser has warned of the risks of spreading COVID-19 infections during the Tokyo Olympics, the Times of London reported on Tuesday, the latest high-profile caveat about the global sporting showpiece. Tohoku University professor Hiroshi Oshitani was an architect of Japan’s “Three Cs” approach to the pandemic, which advises avoiding closed spaces, crowds and close contact situations. “The government and the organizing committee, including the IOC (International Olympic Committee), keep saying they’re holding a safe Olympics. But everybody knows there is a risk. It’s 100 per cent impossible to have an Olympics with zero risk... of the spread of infection in Japan and also in other countries after the Olympics,” the Times quoted Oshitani as telling the newspaper. “There are a number of countries that do not have many cases, and a number that don’t have any variants. We should not make the Olympics (an occasion) to spread the virus to these countries,” he added, noting most countries lack vaccines. Already postponed from last year because of the pandemic, a scaled-down version of the Games with no foreign spectators is set to start on July 23 despite public fears the event could spread the coronavirus and drain medical resources. Japan has not suffered the explosive outbreak seen elsewhere but has recorded nearly 760,000 cases and more than 13,500 deaths. Tokyo and other regions are under a state of emergency after a fourth wave hit, straining hospitals. The government’s top medical adviser, Shigeru Omi, said last week medical experts planned a statement on the Games by June 20, when the state of emergency is set to be lifted. A labor union in the northern island of Hokkaido, where the Olympic marathon will be held, petitioned its governor on Monday calling for the Games to be cancelled, media said. Japanese Olympic Committee board member Kaori Yamaguchi, a judo bronze medalist at the 1988 Games, said on Friday Japan had been “cornered” into pressing ahead with the Games. Japan’s public remains divided about holding the Games, although opposition appears to be easing somewhat. A poll by broadcaster TBS this week showed 55 percent wanted the Games either postponed or cancelled--down 10 points from last month.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14368034

Virus variants causing surge in COVID-19 cases among children,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"June 7, 2021 at 18:20 JST"," More transmissible COVID-19 variants have led to a rapid rise in infections among an age group previously seen as the least susceptible to the novel coronavirus, health experts said. People under 20 years old now account for about 10 percent of all COVID-19 patients in Japan. The health experts are making fresh calls for families to step up protection of their children and to monitor them for signs of severe symptoms that could develop weeks after they become infected. Outbreaks have been reported at schools and child care facilities across the nation, affecting many children. One example was a cluster infection that hit a preschool in Niigata Prefecture in February. Thirteen children and four workers were infected by a variant. The virus eventually spread to family members, raising the total of infections to 42. The case underscores the variants’ ability to spread more easily than the initial coronavirus that was prevalent last year, according to Akihiko Saito, professor of pediatrics at Niigata University who is tasked with compiling anti-coronavirus measures for the Japan Pediatric Society. Health ministry statistics showed that patients under 20 numbered 78,952 as of June 2, accounting for about 10.7 percent of the 737,086 overall COVID-19 patients in Japan. The figure for the under-20 age group has grown by about 2.2 times since Feb. 3, when the country was in the grip of variants that were fast replacing the original type of the coronavirus. In contrast, the number of patients who are 20 or older has increased by about 1.9 times since Feb. 3. Saito said the disparity in the growth of cases between the two age groups does not necessarily mean that children are more vulnerable to variants. “As variants are more transmissible, they push up the number of overall infections, including children,” he said. The common route of infection among children has been through family members. But the sharp rise in infected children indicates that more younger people bear the brunt of household infections driven by variants, according to the experts. Most infected children generally develop mild symptoms. In some extremely rare cases, children slip into serious condition weeks after getting infected. One major concern in Japan has been the multiple reports of children developing multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C), in which patients’ heart or liver functions deteriorate, or they suffer from digestive symptoms, such as diarrhea and stomachaches. The Japanese Society of Kawasaki Disease also said it has confirmed four severe cases of MIS-C among children who were infected with the novel coronavirus. In one case, a teenage boy was hospitalized with a high fever and diarrhea about two months after a family member transmitted the virus to him. The boy suffered from large lymph nodes in the neck, a rash, and red eyes and lips, which are also symptoms of Kawasaki Disease. The causes of the disease, which usually affects children under 5 years old, are unknown. The teenager was hospitalized for about four weeks and has since recovered. He has not complained of any aftereffects, according to the Japanese Society of Kawasaki Disease. In the United States, more than 3.85 million children had been infected by the novel coronavirus by May 6. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported about 3,700 MIS-C cases, including 35 deaths, as of May 3. Mamoru Ayusawa, associate professor of pediatrics at Nihon University and vice chairman of the Japanese Society of Kawasaki Disease, urged parents to closely monitor their children for symptoms, referring to a possible rise in MIS-C cases in Japan amid the continuing pandemic. “(Parents) should pay attention especially to symptoms of children’s digestive organs, chest pain and complexion over a couple of months after they are infected with the coronavirus,” he said. “If children show such symptoms, they should see a doctor at a hospital with a large pediatrics department.”",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14367428
Chiba governor: No good reason to let spectators attend Olympics,['By YOSHIHIRO SAKAI/ Staff Writer'],"June 7, 2021 at 16:45 JST"," Chiba Governor Toshihito Kumagai on June 6 insisted that the Tokyo Olympics be held without spectators, arguing that there are more important things, such as public health, than watching sports live. “If the Games are hosted with spectators, the risks of creating a huge flow of people will be the highest,” Kumagai said on his blog. “The Olympics may be a once-in-a-lifetime event, but they are just sports events after all.” Chiba Prefecture, located just east of the capital, is scheduled to host events in four Olympic sports: fencing, taekwondo and wrestling in Chiba city, and surfing in Ichinomiya town. Olympic organizers have already decided that spectators from overseas will be banned from attending the Olympics as a measure against the spread of the novel coronavirus, but they have not yet decided on whether to allow any people into the stands. In what is believed to be his first public opinion on the issue, Kumagai, who took office in April, said on his blog that if spectators are allowed, he “will not be able to ask residents to refrain from crossing prefectural borders and to avoid nonessential outings during the Summer Games.” He asked the central government and Olympic organizing officials to explicitly recognize this point. The governor also compared watching the Olympics with visiting hometowns to see family members for the first time in a year or traveling with a growing 5-year-old child. “Those cases cannot be considered less essential than going to watch the Games,” he wrote. Kumagai also commented on the government’s comparison of the Olympics with professional baseball games that now allow a limited number of spectators in the stands. “We should not think of an event held by private companies and an event hosted by governments in the same way,” he said. “There are no important life-sustaining reasons for the Games to be held with spectators.”",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14367402
Second Olympic viewing event at Tokyo park faces call for scrapping,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"June 7, 2021 at 15:05 JST"," Musashino city officials are asking that a s cheduled public viewing event in Inokashira Park for the Tokyo Olympics be called off to prevent the spread of novel coronavirus infections. Neighboring Mitaka city, which co-hosts the park with Musashino, has not called for its cancellation but is asking that stronger anti-virus measures be taken for the event. The Musashino city government on June 4 submitted a request for the Tokyo metropolitan government to call off the public event at the park, which straddles both cities. On the same day, Mitaka city government also asked the metropolitan government to take tougher anti-virus measures for the event and share information on what those will be. The requests follow the Tokyo metropolitan government's decision on June 1 to cancel plans to use Yoyogi Park in Shibuya Ward for a public viewing event during the Olympics. Instead it plans to set up a mass vaccination center there. At the public viewing sites, Olympic partner corporations plan to set up booths and visitors can try their hand at some of the events. The Inokashira Park event venue is expected to have a capacity to host 20,000 visitors. In Hachioji, also in western Tokyo, another Olympic viewing event is scheduled in the Minami-Osawa Campus auditorium of Tokyo Metropolitan University. According to the university, the auditorium can accommodate about 1,000 people. However, the university's labor union is calling for scrapping the event due to its concerns over holding it during the COVID-19 pandemic. It is asking the university to refuse to let the Tokyo metropolitan government use the auditorium. In a statement, the union said, “As the metropolitan government is asking the university to hold online classes and cancel students’ extracurricular activities, it is simultaneously calling for cooperation for the public viewing event, which will attract an unknown number of spectators.

Squid statue paid for with COVID-19 funds inks following in Noto,['By HIROYUKI KOJIMA/ Staff Writer'],"June 6, 2021 at 07:10 JST"," NOTO, Ishikawa Prefecture--A giant squid statue here funded by a central government subsidy to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic is no longer being derided as a colossal waste of taxpayers' money by all. Instead, to people like squid lover Nameko Shinsan, who sometimes eats the popular seafood three times a day, the statue ""looks as if it is swimming right there and has a life force."" The squid’s mouth is a hole where visitors can poke their head through. “For squid lovers, sticking your head out of the mouth is like a dream come true,” Shinsan said. Visitors take a picture of a giant squid statue in Noto, Ishikawa Prefecture, on April 9. (Hiroyuki Kojima) The squid is a super life-like statue, 13 meters in length and four meters in height. It weighs about five tons. The squid has goggling eyes and its legs stretch out long and far as if it is dancing and moving. The statue, made of fiber-reinforced plastic, was installed on the side of a prefectural road that runs along Tsukumo Bay, a popular spot for sightseeing and pleasure boats, in late March. It is in the town of Noto, located near the tip of the Noto Peninsula, more than two hours by car from the prefectural capital, Kanazawa. The town’s Ogi Port is a leading port for the catch of surumeika, a type of squid. Town officials said the statue’s concept is dog-eat-dog, or ""squid-eat-squid."" The town last year came up with a plan to build the statue near a facility that has a shop, restaurant, tourist information center and exhibition corner featuring the squid, hoping to boost its post-pandemic tourism economy. According to town officials, 25 million yen ($229,400), or 90 percent of the construction costs, were paid for with COVID-19 relief funds from the central government. The town shouldered the rest of the costs, about 2 million yen. There have been reports around the country that local governments spent the funds, called a local recreation emergency grant, on offbeat items such as “a bell to eliminate discrimination against COVID-19” and “illumination in front of a train station.” LOCAL ATTRACTION DESPITE NEGATIVE COVERAGE As soon as the Noto town officials announced its plan to install a giant squid with the COVID-19 money, they were swept up in a flood of criticism from far and wide. Foreign news media, including the BBC and The New York Times, reported on the controversy. A town official said in frustration, “News media reported it as if we spent all of the COVID-19 relief funds on the squid.” However, the squid has been a sleeper hit with many locals and visitors. A giant squid statue installed in front of Tsukumo Bay in Noto, Ishikawa Prefecture, on April 9 (Hiroyuki Kojima) On a weekday in April, families and couples surrounded the statue to take a picture with it. A man in his 40s, who lives in Kanazawa and works in the construction industry, said he came to the town for work. When he was driving along the prefectural road, he was so surprised to see the giant squid that he had to pull over to take a look. “The complexion looks very authentic. It has a strong impact,” he said. The town government called for a nickname for the squid and received 909 suggestions, officials said. Town officials see no problem with spending the relief money on the statue. The central government listed examples for the use of the fund, which include projects that “polish up local attractions” and “promote local specialties.” The town officials said the statue falls under these two categories. In fiscal 2020, the town received COVID-19 relief funds totaling 680 million yen. Much of the money was spent on a project to provide a terminal device to every student attending the town’s elementary and junior high schools for online classes, as well as for issuing shopping vouchers to boost the local economy. NOT ALL ON BOARD WITH EXPENDITURE Hideki Noboru, a professor on local autonomy at Meijo University, said the spending on the squid was not an appropriate use of the funds. He said the central government allowed local governments wide discretion in spending the money, which spurred local governments to go overboard on projects that are not closely related to COVID-19 measures. “I think it is fraud committed against the people,” Noboru said. A man in his 60s who lives in Noto said the squid “may bring in tourists, but the money should have been spent on support for health care organizations that have worked hard on the front lines of the pandemic.” A giant squid statue lit up at night on April 9 in Noto, Ishikawa Prefecture (Hiroyuki Kojima) Despite the criticism, the squid has established itself as a new local attraction. It is lit up at night, drawing even more attention. A woman in her 70s who lives near the statue has welcomed her new shiny neighbor. She said many households in the community are elderly people and the local sentiment tends to be negative. “But the light of the squid has brightened the mood of our community,” she said. Shinsan said she becomes hungry just by seeing a picture of the statue. She believes the statue actually will achieve a purpose of the fund by making the local specialty well known around the nation. “I have eaten squid in Saga Prefecture but never in Noto,” she said. Once the pandemic has ended, she wants to fulfill her dream of sticking her head out of the squid’s mouth.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14354438

The prefecture is currently under a COVID-19 state of emergency. Prefectural officials reported about 120 new COVID-19 cases per 100,000 people over the most recent week, much higher than any other prefecture in Japan, according to data from the National Institute of Infectious Diseases. The health ministry’s advisory panel of experts on the pandemic expressed alarm at the figure at its meeting on June 2, calling it “unprecedentedly high.” The occupancy rate of hospital beds remains high in the prefecture. As of June 2, 99.5 percent of hospital beds set aside for COVID-19 patients were filled, while the figure was 93.2 percent for beds for patients with other diseases, according to the prefectural government. The Okinawa Prefectural Nanbu Medical Center & Children’s Medical Center in Haebaru, which has provided inpatient treatment to some 500 people infected with the novel coronavirus, declared a hospital state of emergency on June 1. The center announced it will limit the number of outpatients and inpatients it accepts per day until June 20, when the central government’s state of emergency is due to end. The center said it will give priority to those who require emergency care when accepting inpatients. Okinawa Chubu Hospital in Uruma also began restricting outpatient services and hospitalizations on June 2. Ishigaki issued its own state of emergency on May 31.

"EU agrees to add Japan to safe travel list, holds off on Britain",['REUTERS'],"June 3, 2021 at 12:46 JST"," BRUSSELS--European Union governments agreed on Wednesday to add Japan to their small list of countries from which they will allow non-essential travel, while holding off until at least mid-June for British tourists, EU sources said on Tuesday. Ambassadors from the EU's 27 countries approved the addition of Japan at a meeting on Wednesday, with the change to take effect in the coming days. EU countries are recommended gradually to lift travel restrictions for the current seven countries on the list - Australia, Israel, New Zealand, Rwanda, Singapore, South Korea and Thailand. Individual EU countries can still opt to demand a negative COVID-19 test or a period of quarantine. The EU last month eased criteria for adding new countries to the list, by changing to 75 from 25 the maximum number of new COVID-19 cases per 100,000 people in the previous 14 days. Britain met that revised target but was left off the list because of an increase in COVID-19 cases arising from an infectious coronavirus variant first identified in India. Britain recorded no COVID-19 deaths on Tuesday, for the first time since March 2020, but cases of the Indian variant doubled last week and the government has said it is too early to say whether Britain can fully drop restrictions on June 21. EU diplomats said Britain could be added to the list, depending on the course of the variant, in mid-June, when a larger group of countries are expected to be considered. The list is designed to eliminate inconsistency of travel restrictions across the bloc. France and Germany have imposed quarantines on UK visitors and Austria banned British tourists, while Portugal and Spain now welcome them. Meanwhile, Britain advises against travel to all EU countries except Portugal and only exempts people coming from Portugal from a requirement to quarantine.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14364317

OLYMPICS/ Host city to vaccinate staff helping athletes before seniors,['By HISAO NAGATA/ Staff Writer'],"June 2, 2021 at 19:21 JST"," OTA, Gunma Prefecture--A city that is hosting the Australian women's softball team prior to the Tokyo Olympics will use vaccines secured for senior citizens to inoculate Japanese staff who are taking care of the athletes. Officials here said the Cabinet Secretariat on June 1 accepted the city’s request to prioritize the vaccinations of city and hotel employees who are helping the Australian team. The city government made the request on the evening of May 31, asking “Please allow us to vaccinate Japanese staff in order to host a safe Olympics.” “It is not good that they hold practices fearing if they contract the virus from each other. But if the Japanese side are vaccinated, it will lead to safety and security,” Ota Mayor Masayoshi Shimizu said at a news conference on May 31. But a city official did not deny uneasiness in the decision, citing that the city, in fact, received complaints and angry calls from about 100 residents after the early vaccination of 300 people last month. “If we give the Olympics special treatment and let the (staff) jump the line, we will likely be swamped with complaints,” the official said. Asked by a reporter if such decision would provoke a backlash from residents, the mayor said, “I don’t think it is that much of a sin.” “And we don’t have such a petty person in Ota,” he added. Ota is hosting a pre-Olympic training camp for the Australian softball team, who arrived in the city on June 1. The team is expected to stay until July 17, practice and play games against Japanese teams, before the Olympics open on July 23. All 33 members of the team have been vaccinated before departing from Australia. They will take a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test every day during their 47-day stay in the city. City and hotel employees who take care of the team will be required to take a daily PCR test, while Japanese players and umpires involved in practice games are expected to take a test by the day before a game. But none on the Japanese side has received a vaccination. Since the team stays in a ""bubble"" and is only allowed to move between the hotel and a baseball park where they practice, city employees take care of many daily chores for the team, such as shopping. They are also tasked to prepare the practice facility including groundkeeping duties and keeping close tabs from the stands. According to the city, 13 city employees and 40 or so hotel employees who come into close contact with the athletes are expected to receive two Pfizer shots, originally secured through the central government to vaccinate elderly residents of Ota. Shimizu told reporters that such preferential treatment would not deprive senior citizens of being inoculated. “Seniors in Ota have received a Moderna vaccine at a mass vaccination center set up by the prefectural government, too,” Shimizu said. Therefore, the mayor said, “Inevitably, we will have vaccines to spare.” But the reality may not be so rosy. According to the city’s estimate, the city has secured enough Pfizer vaccines to inoculate about 54,200 people, 90 percent of the city’s elderly population, by the week starting June 21. The city has received a postcard reply from more than 80 percent of the elderly population who said they want to be vaccinated. The ratio of people who are willing to receive a vaccine was much higher than the city’s estimate, which was 70 percent. A prefectural Tomo vaccination center was set up in the city on May 24. By May 30, 300 elderly residents went in first ahead of 60,000 others and received a shot. It accounted for only 0.5 percent of the entire elderly population of the city. More vaccines are scheduled to be delivered to the city in July, which are intended for residents younger than 65. “If there is a shortage of vaccines, we can divert these vaccines,” said a city official who handles the vaccination project. “But we could well be criticized by residents who wonder, ‘Why do we have to go to such lengths for the Olympics?’” the official added.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14363904

Akihito, 87, and Michiko, 86, got their jabs at their residence, the Sento Imperial Palace in Tokyo’s Minato Ward. Prince Hitachi and his wife, Princess Hanako, as well as Princess Nobuko, the widow of Prince Tomohito, and Princess Hisako, the widow of Prince Takamado, received inoculations at the Imperial Household Hospital in the Imperial Palace, sources said. They were the first royal family members to have been vaccinated. Seven royal family members were eligible for the prioritized vaccination for people aged 65 or older. Only Princess Yuriko, 97, the widow of Prince Mikasa, has not received the vaccination yet. Unlike members of the general public, imperial family members do not register their addresses with municipal governments, and as such they would not receive vaccination vouchers from them.

"Osaka’s infection total exceeds 100,000; 53% in past 3 months",['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"June 2, 2021 at 19:15 JST"," More than half of all novel coronavirus infections in Osaka Prefecture, which exceeded 100,000 on June 2, were reported over the past three months, showing that earlier pre-emergency measures had failed, officials said. The Osaka prefectural government attributed the increase to the spread of the British variant and other mutated strains of the virus. Osaka Prefecture confirmed 213 new infections on June 2. That brought its total number of cases recorded since January 2020, when the first infection was reported in Japan, to 100,199, according to a tally by The Asahi Shimbun. The central government applied pre-emergency measures for Osaka, Hyogo and Miyagi prefectures from April 5 following a spike in infections there. But the number of new cases began exceeding 1,000 every day in Osaka Prefecture since mid-April, prompting the central government to issue a state of emergency for the prefecture on April 25. “The pre-emergency measures helped reduce the flow of people but failed to curb the number of new infections,” an Osaka prefectural government official said. “Both the movement of people and infection cases dropped sharply after the state of emergency was declared.” Osaka Prefecture logged 1,814 cases during the first wave of infections, which hit the country between Jan. 29 and June 13 last year. The prefecture reported 9,307 cases during the second wave between June 14 and Oct. 9 and 36,067 during the third wave between Oct. 10 and Feb. 28. As of June 2, Osaka Prefecture confirmed 53,011 infections during the current fourth wave, which started on March 1. The figure for the past three months accounted for 53 percent of the total number of cases reported in the prefecture. The cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in Tokyo has already surpassed 100,000 and reached 161,426 as of June 1. The capital on June 2 confirmed 487 new novel coronavirus infections, down 256 from a week earlier, as well as 13 deaths from COVID-19. The daily average of new infections in Tokyo for the week through June 2 came to 500.4, or 82.3 percent of the preceding seven-day period.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14363922
Tokyo ditches plan for Olympic viewing event at Yoyogi Park,['By MOMOKO IKEGAMI/ Staff Writer'],"June 2, 2021 at 19:03 JST"," After coming under heavy criticism, the Tokyo metropolitan government on June 1 scrapped plans to use Yoyogi Park for a public viewing event during the Olympics and instead will set up a mass vaccination center there. The park in Tokyo’s Shibuya Ward will be used to vaccinate employees of the Metropolitan Police Department and Fire Department starting on June 8. The metropolitan government’s plan to set up public viewing event sites for the Games has drawn fire over concerns that such crowded venues could hasten the spread of novel coronavirus infections at a time most of the Japanese population has yet to be vaccinated. The metropolitan government last month announced plans to inoculate police officers and firefighters at the former site of the Tsukiji fish market in Chuo Ward from June 8. But the Tsukiji site can be used for such vaccinations only until the end of this month because it is scheduled to be turned into a depot for vehicles associated with the Summer Games, which open on July 23. The metropolitan government decided to continue rolling out vaccines for police and firefighters at Yoyogi Park. The site will still be used for a public viewing event during the Paralympics, which begin on Aug. 24, as was planned. Public viewing events for the Olympics will be held at sites in Inokashira Park straddling Musashino and Mitaka on the outskirts of Tokyo and the square in front of Chofu Station, along with similar sites in Iwate, Miyagi, Fukushima and Kumamoto prefectures.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14363800
Virus expert calls for reduced scale of Olympics held amid pandemic,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"June 2, 2021 at 18:37 JST"," Out of fears about further spreading the coronavirus, the head of a government pandemic-response panel is urging that the scale of the Tokyo Olympics be kept to a minimum with strict safety measures in place if Japan pushes ahead with holding the Games. Shigeru Omi said at the Lower House Committee of Health, Labor and Welfare on June 2 that staging the Summer Games amid a major health crisis would be ruled out under normal circumstances. “But if organizers were to hold the Olympics (amid the pandemic), it would be their responsibility to minimize the scope of the event and strengthen health management,” he said. Omi, an expert on contagious diseases, was pressing for an Olympics with no spectators, or at least a minimal number of spectators, to prevent many people from coming into close contact. The Summer Olympics are scheduled to open on July 23. He also said the public “will be less likely to cooperate with efforts to host the Games, as it is unclear why organizers are bothering to hold the event despite the public health crisis.” Omi indicated he and other panel members would share their concerns about the risks of the Olympics turning into a super-spreader event with the International Olympic Committee and Tokyo Olympic organizing committee but not with the central government. He said that is because the government alone cannot decide on the fate of the event. Omi has taken the position that it is not the job of health experts to decide whether the Summer Games should be held. But he has said many experts believe they have the responsibility to provide advice on how to lower the risks of infection and point out any areas where risks are high.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14363884
Welfare benefit applications up for 1st time in 11 years in FY 2020,['By RYUICHI HISANAGA/ Staff Writer'],"June 2, 2021 at 18:32 JST"," The number of applicants for welfare benefits in Japan rose for the first time in 11 years in fiscal 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, as did the number of households that started to receive them, the labor ministry announced. Both numbers had been trending downward after they increased in fiscal 2009 in the aftermath of the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy and the ensuing global financial crisis. In fiscal 2020, the number of people who applied for welfare benefits climbed 2.3 percent year on year to 228,081, while the number of households that started to receive them rose 2.1 percent to 202,856, the ministry said on June 2. The highest number of welfare benefit applications filed in the fiscal year came when Japan declared its first state of emergency in April 2020, with applications jumping 24.9 percent year on year. The monthly figures were lower year on year between May and August last year, but from September to March they were higher year on year. For those seven months, the number of applications filed continued rising. In March, they rose 8.6 percent year on year. April 2020 also marked the fiscal year's highest growth rate in the number of households that started to receive the assistance, a 14.9 percent increase.

"Ishigaki island in Okinawa, hit hard by virus, under emergency",['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"June 2, 2021 at 18:30 JST"," This popular tourist destination here on a remote southern island is reeling under a surge of novel coronavirus infections, forcing local officials to declare their own state of emergency. Ishigaki logged a record 25 new COVID-19 cases on May 31. The number of new infections in the most recent week per 100,000 population was 209.84, far higher than that of the entire Okinawa Prefecture, which was 127.43. The spike prompted city officials to issue the emergency declaration on May 31, urging residents to stay home even if they have no symptoms. All schools have been shut down. Hotels have received cancellation requests. At the Okinawa Prefectural Yaeyama Hospital, 37 of 41 beds set aside exclusively for COVID-19 patients have been occupied. Three of the patients have developed severe symptoms. “The situation is very difficult,"" a prefectural official said. ""It has already started greatly impacting general practitioners.” The city’s state of emergency, which urges residents to stay home from June 1 to 15, is strictly voluntary and not enforceable under a law or an ordinance. Businesses in the city are also asked to reduce the number of employees working in offices and to implement thorough measures to prevent infections from spreading. Both prefectural and city education boards decided to close schools from June 2 to 13. About 5,000 students who attend city-run elementary and junior high schools, as well as 1,400 or so who attend prefectural schools, have been urged to refrain from going out. According to the city’s education board, students at the affected elementary and junior high schools have obtained study materials online. Those who do not have an internet connection at home have received paper versions. The prefectural education board on June 1 notified prefectural high schools and others to support online learning for students. Junichi Ebinuma, 42, who runs a cafe in Ishigaki, on June 1 asked customers to sit side by side to prevent infections and shortened business hours. The number of customers that day was less than usual but several tourists came by, he said. Ebinuma decided not to serve alcohol. After 8 p.m., the cafe only accepts to-go and delivery orders. “As a business, it is difficult. But I think it will be effective in (preventing infections from spreading),” he said. Citing the fact that several people around him have tested positive for the virus, Ebinuma showed understanding for the declaration of a state of emergency. A 62-year-old woman who runs a guest house in the city said she has been inundated with cancellation requests since the prefecture came under the central government’s state of emergency late last month. All bookings made until around June 20 when the state of emergency for the prefecture expires have been canceled, she said. To anyone inquiring about a room reservations at the guest house, the woman would reply, “You would not be admitted to a hospital now because the hospitals are full.” The city’s issuance of its own state of emergency “came too little too late,” she lamented. The Okinawa leg of the Tokyo Olympic torch relay passed through Ishigaki before the Golden Week national holidays in early May. She said authorities “should have tightened border controls before the long holidays.” “It is hard to see negative news on the internet and on TV. Small accommodations (like mine) will not survive if this continues,” she said. (This article was written by Maho Fukui and Takuya Miyano.)",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14363801
"Companies, universities can start COVID-19 shots on June 21",['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"June 2, 2021 at 15:00 JST"," The government is opening a third avenue for COVID-19 vaccinations—companies and universities—to accelerate and expand coverage against the novel coronavirus. Chief Cabinet Secretary Katsunobu Kato said at his June 1 news conference that companies and universities can start giving shots to employees and students and faculty on June 21 using the recently approved vaccine developed by Moderna Inc. of the United States. The vaccine developed jointly by U.S. pharmaceutical company Pfizer Inc. and German biocommerce company BioNTech has been used for senior citizens, but as of May 31 only about 14 percent of that age group had received even a single dose. Japan’s vaccine program started in February for health care workers. Inoculations have been conducted at medical facilities and government-designated venues. Vaccinations in the third avenue will be managed by the companies and universities themselves. Although major companies with clinics or medical personnel regularly stationed on their premises could start giving the jabs from June 21, smaller businesses may have to find other means to inoculate their employees. One option may be to have local chambers of commerce organize joint vaccination programs for small businesses. Kato indicated that each company can decide if family members of employees as well as those working for subcontracted companies will be included. A number of companies whose employees are in regular contact with the general public, such as airlines and railway operators, have indicated they were preparing to begin vaccinations on June 21. Kato said that those seeking jabs at companies and universities can do so even if they have not yet received vaccination tickets from their local governments. The government has signed a contract with Moderna to obtain enough vaccines for 25 million people. The government has also set a goal of giving all senior citizens the required two shots by the end of July. The new program will mean that vaccinations will also be provided to much younger age groups. Kato also said local governments can begin inoculating other residents once they determine that the goal of vaccinating their senior citizens is in reach. Local governments are being asked to prepare vaccination tickets for mailing to the general population from mid-June. Masakazu Tokura, the new chairman of the powerful Keidanren (Japan Business Federation), said at a June 1 news conference that his organization would cooperate fully with the government plan for vaccinations at companies. Although it is unclear how many companies can begin to administer the shots on June 21, a high-ranking official of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party said that spreading the availability of vaccinations would help in holding the Tokyo Olympics about a month later. Takashi Nakano, a pediatrics professor at Kawasaki Medical School who is also knowledgeable about vaccines, said inoculations at the workplace would help protect other people. Those receiving the jabs not only have a comparatively low risk of developing serious symptoms, but they are also in the age group at high risk of infecting others because their work may take them to various locations outside the company, he said. Nakano added that steps would be needed to deal with possible side effects after inoculating employees.

Monitoring of teleworkers raises concerns of Big Brother,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"June 2, 2021 at 08:00 JST"," A supervisor told a woman not to worry about the company’s new plans for teleworking employees. Using software, her employer would determine how long she worked from home and would log the names of every Word and Excel file she used. There would be records kept of the subjects on her emails and which websites she viewed, as well as how long she actually operated her computer. All that data would be shared among management. “This is not surveillance,” the supervisor explained. The woman left the company two months later. “Is working at home impossible without such a thorough staff monitoring system?” the woman said with a sigh. With more people working from home in the COVID-19 pandemic, employers are using increasingly advanced software to remotely check if staff are loafing on the job. Some companies say the software is used to prevent extreme overtime. But whatever the reason, employees have expressed concerns about excessive surveillance and rising stress levels because of the monitoring. UNSHARED DETAILS NOW SHARED The woman who quit her job had worked as an editor of websites and paper publications. In January this year, she and her colleagues were encouraged to work from home under the second COVID-19 state of emergency. According to the employer’s accounts, the monitoring software was intended to see whether proper amounts of work were assigned to each worker and if such tasks were being done efficiently. The company said it would use the objective numerical data to review workload allocations and improve productivity because there would be far fewer opportunities for staff members to meet their bosses in person. But the woman and her colleagues could not believe that explanation, and they thought the company “simply wants to ensure that teleworkers are not lying down on the job.” The woman said she already had no time to relax while on duty because of strict deadlines and constant communication with clients. Being monitored as a teleworker increased the mental pressure on her. A rumor circulated that “just opening a file to work on would not be regarded as part of the job if nothing is done on it for a certain period of time.” That rumor heightened fears among workers that their employer was watching their every move. The woman said she tried to show she was present in front of her PC by working on unimportant email after finishing another task. While at the office, she said she was assessed based on the quality of her written articles and other outcomes. But after she began teleworking, all unshared details, including websites she referred to for writing, were made clear to management. “The company cannot trust employees when they are not in the office unless everything is made visible,” the woman said. “The employer’s stance was horrific.” Although she loved the work, she quit the company by March, saying the monitoring left her with a bad aftertaste. Some monitoring systems randomly select images of the teleworking employees’ computer screens, and another system uses cameras to take videos of them working. A Persol Research and Consulting Co. study in March 2020 found that 40 percent of bosses fear at times that teleworkers “may not do their tasks.” The percentage is higher than that of teleworkers who think they “may be considered to be slacking off on the job.” LABOR-MANAGEMENT TALKS URGED The Labor Lawyers Association of Japan said in a statement about teleworking in February that it is “a problem that employers constantly monitor the progress of work of employees.” Lawyer Kazuya Takemura, who is knowledgeable about teleworking, said “surveillance using software is the same as supervisors’ always watching subordinates’ work beside them at the office.” “Management and labor unions should discuss and determine how far employees should be managed to prevent a psychological burden from being imposed on them,” Takemura said. Some employers say that if attendance-recording systems are embedded into employees’ computers to check when they log on and off, working times can be very closely controlled, and excessive overtime can be prevented. “Labor time management is different from surveillance,” Takemura said. “Good use of technologies should be made without going as far as to carry out excessive surveillance.” The government, which has promoted working from home during the health crisis, is preparing a foundation for a much wider use of teleworking mechanisms. Labor ministry guidelines revised in March said companies that highly evaluate employees who continue commuting to offices go against the promotion of remote working styles. The ministry also strongly demands measures to prevent people from working excessive hours outside their offices. But it is difficult to clearly separate labor time management from surveillance. “Required first of all is a condition where employees can work securely under the company’s proper control,” said a labor ministry official about work management via the internet. “Talks between labor and management to set rules are important.” One significant precaution suggested is creating an atmosphere where employees can voice objections if they find the surveillance extreme and uncomfortable.

Panel experts mull how to raise doubts about holding Olympics,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"June 1, 2021 at 18:57 JST"," Some members of a government expert panel assigned to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic oppose holding the Olympics if infections are skyrocketing in Tokyo, but they have been reluctant to publicly present such views. According to several panel members who spoke to The Asahi Shimbun, many on the 17-member committee feel it would be difficult to go ahead with the Summer Games if the COVID-19 situation in the capital was at the most serious stage 4, meaning an “explosive growth” of new infections. But the members are still considering how to express this opinion, citing the huge social impact such an announcement would have. Panel members also said they were uncertain about how to state their views because the Tokyo Olympic organizing committee has its own panel of experts that is looking into how the event should be held. However, some government panel members feel they should make their opinions known before the organizing committee decides later this month on whether spectators will be allowed in the stands for the Olympics. If the Olympics are held, domestic travel to Tokyo would increase significantly, raising the risk of an explosion in new COVID-19 cases, they said. If Tokyo was at stage 4 during the Olympics, not only would new cases rise, but the health care system also would be strained, making it more difficult to provide ordinary medical care to the general public. Panel members also assessed what could happen if the Olympics were held while Tokyo was at stage 3, meaning a “sharp increase” in new infections. One assessment was that new cases would jump either during the Olympics or soon after the Closing Ceremony. It added that no spectators should be allowed into the stands and the overall scale of the event should be reduced in a stage 3 situation. Panel members also pointed out that Japan would have to bear the responsibility if the sporting extravaganza becomes a “superspreader” event that ends up contaminating populations overseas. “We want the government to present a detailed risk assessment for each stage of the infection spread,” one panel member said.

OLYMPICS/ Spectators may need negative COVID-19 test to enter venues,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"June 1, 2021 at 18:18 JST"," Government and Olympic-related officials are considering tougher anti-virus measures for the upcoming Tokyo Games, including requiring spectators to show negative COVID-19 test certificates at the time of admission, if they are allowed to attend the events. The plan would obligate spectators to undergo PCR tests in advance and show the certificates obtained within one week of entry to an Olympic venue. People who received vaccine shots will be exempted from the requirement, but they will need to show their vaccination certificates instead, according to the officials. However, some government officials and experts raised doubts about the achievability of implementing such a large-scale precautionary measure at this late date in addition to a possible public backlash. “There have not been official negative certificates issued (in Japan),” said an official handling the Olympic and Paralympic Games. “For instance, any document issued by hospitals where spectators are tested will be acceptable? How can you confirm them as authentic? It can cause many problems.” The government and the Tokyo Olympics organizing committee have already decided not to accept overseas spectators. All spectators will be prohibited from eating and drinking alcohol at the venues as well. The government and organizers are planning to decide whether the Games will be held with spectators in June as they monitor the infection trends and analyze the outlook for the state of emergency, which is currently in effect for Tokyo and nine prefectures. A government official said that Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga and his administration “are leaning toward hosting the Olympics with spectators.” If the government decides to hold it with spectators, it wants to improve the effectiveness of anti-virus measures by requiring the COVID-19 negative test certificates. When Suga was questioned at a May 28 news conference about the risk of the Olympics spreading infections further, he showed willingness to hold them with spectators, citing professional baseball games as an example that have fans in the stands. “It is true that they are being held with spectators as measures to prevent the virus from spreading are in place.

While national and other museums in the capital are reopening from June 1, four museums in Osaka will remain closed until the June 20 deadline for the end of the state of emergency. And for the Tokyo museums, reservations must be obtained beforehand through the internet as the number of entrants will be limited daily. In Tokyo, fans of cinemas and super “sento” bathhouses were lining up outside those establishments before their doors opened. At the Shinjuku Piccadilly cinema complex, a 59-year-old man living in Matsudo, Chiba Prefecture, came straight to the theater after getting off the night shift at his job as a security guard. “I was looking forward to it reopening for so long,” the man said. “There are so many movies I want to see, so I'll watch two today.” A 53-year-old female company employee living in Shinjuku Ward said, “Movies are indispensable for maintaining my health because they help me laugh and cry. I'm so relieved it's open again.” Most major cinema complexes had cooperated with government requests to cease operations from April 25. But even with the new relaxed restrictions, Tokyo cinema complexes will shut at 9 p.m. daily. Osaka movie theaters will remain closed on weekends. There were also people waiting for the Ryogokuyuya Edoyu public bathhouse to open in the capital’s Sumida Ward. The super sento previously operated from 11 a.m. until 9 a.m. the next day. In compliance with the April request, it had remained closed for more than a month. Even with the relaxed measures, it will only operate until 8 p.m. every day and remain closed on weekends. Bathhouse staff were busy cleaning the baths and disinfecting lockers from about two hours before opening. While there are 400 lockers at the bathhouse, only half will be in use to allow for proper social distancing among customers. Posters have been put up at various locations in the bathhouse calling on customers to bathe without conversing, and the facility has put out more bottles of disinfectant for people to use. A 41-year-old female company employee living in Edogawa Ward was in line to enter from before 11 a.m. “Even with the pandemic going on, I need to relax,” she said. She planned to use various different baths until the evening, she added. The relaxed measures in Tokyo also cover video game centers, pachinko parlors, gymnasiums and bowling alleys. Four zoos and aquariums in the capital, including the zoo at Ueno, will resume operations from June 4. All four have been closed since December. But the number of daily entrants will be limited and reservations are required. Universal Studios Japan in Osaka reopened from June 1, with business hours from 10 a.m. until 6 p.m. Only 5,000 customers will be allowed in daily and the theme park will remain closed on weekends. While Chiba Prefecture is not covered by the state of emergency, the two Disney-related theme parks in Urayasu will continue with operating hours between 10 a.m. and 7 p.m. and upper limits of 5,000 people will be allowed in daily until June 20. Establishments that serve alcohol are being asked to remain closed until June 20.

Kobe Marathon called off again due to pandemic,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"May 31, 2021 at 05:30 JST"," KOBE--The Kobe Marathon is being called off for the second straight year due to difficulties securing medical staff and volunteers because of the novel coronavirus pandemic, organizers said. The marathon scheduled to be held Nov. 21 would have marked the 10th anniversary of the annual event and at least 20,000 entrants were expected. But organizers decided that staging a large-scale event would be risky at a time when the country, not just Kobe and Hyogo Prefecture, is struggling to contain the health crisis. Hyogo Prefecture is now under its third state of emergency as a fourth wave of infections has triggered a surge of new cases. The curbs are due to expire June 20. Last year’s Kobe Marathon was also canceled due to the pandemic. Organizers decided in March it would be OK to go ahead with the marathon and were preparing steps to ensure safety against the virus, such as expanding the area at the start line to reduce congestion based on guidance provided by the Japan Association of Athletics Federations. They also planned to secure more staff to guide runners, implement measures to monitor the temperature of the entrants and organize water stations along the route. This was to be done by raising the entry fee. The Kobe Marathon is organized primarily by the Hyogo prefectural and Kobe city governments. The Asahi Shimbun acts as a co-organizer.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14361590

Governors call for tightened steps against Indian variant,['By HARUFUMI MORI/ Staff Writer'],"May 30, 2021 at 17:45 JST"," Prefectural governors across Japan made an impassioned plea to the government to enhance steps against a coronavirus variant from India and to help speed up the vaccine rollout. As an immediate step, they called for strengthened checks at airports to keep the virus from entering Japan. Their proposals were compiled at an online meeting of the association of governors held May 29 in response to the government’s announcement the day before that the state of emergency for Tokyo and eight other prefectures will be extended beyond May 31 until June 20. At the meeting attended by 43 governors, many expressed concerns about the Indian variant, which is deemed to be more contagious than a variant first detected in Britain. The variant from Britain is now the dominant strain spreading in Japan, which is in the grip of a fourth wave of infections. The strain was first detected in Japan late last year. In calling for more rigorous measures at airports, Tottori Governor Shinji Hirai said the government’s efforts to keep the virus from Britain at bay had failed miserably. Toshihito Kumagai, the governor of Chiba Prefecture where Narita Airport is located, also acknowledged that the virus has made inroads into Japan despite airport checks aimed at detecting incoming affected passengers. Twenty-nine cases of the Indian variant had been detected in Japan as of May 24, the health ministry said. Among other proposals, the governors called on the government to keep track of the whereabouts of new arrivals during the two-week period they are obliged to provide frequent updates on the state of their health. They also urged it to share information on suspected infection cases and for local governments to receive assistance in identifying variants at regional labs, just like central government-affiliated facilities. With regard to vaccines, the governors urged the government to swiftly provide information on the schedules of supplies in July and beyond, including how many doses will be provided and for which vaccine. They also suggested that essential workers, such as the police and staff at facilities for people with disabilities and childcare centers, to be vaccinated ahead of the general public. To date, the authorities have placed priority on inoculating health care workers and those aged 65 or older. A number of governors proposed that jabs be offered at company offices and universities to speed up inoculations of those aged 64 or younger. “The government needs to work on a program to allow people to get vaccinated at their office or university,” said Osaka Governor Hirofumi Yoshimura, noting that many large companies and universities are located in his prefecture.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14361541

Those with Olympic links able to bypass self-quarantine,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"May 29, 2021 at 18:50 JST"," More than 1,400 athletes, officials and other key personnel associated with the Olympic Games being staged in Tokyo from July were exempted from self-isolating after arriving in Japan. The special treatment since April is in stark contrast to strict government policy implemented after the novel coronavirus pandemic struck early last year. Foreign nationals, in principle, remain prohibited from entering Japan, now in the grip of a fourth wave of COVID-19 cases. And even Japanese nationals living overseas and spouses of permanent residents are only permitted to enter under special circumstances. In all cases, those individuals are required to self-quarantine for two weeks. The government admitted May 28 that it was giving preferential treatment to Olympic athletes, coaches, referees and executives connected with the sports events after Akira Nagatsuma, a member of the opposition Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan, raised the issue during a session of the Lower House Health, Labor and Welfare Committee. The government said that 1,649 foreign nationals connected with the Olympics had entered Japan since April, of whom 1,432 were exempted from the self-quarantine requirement. Those connected with the Olympics and Paralympics were exempted from the self-quarantine restriction as long as they repeatedly take polymerase chain reaction tests. Athletes are allowed, in principle, to take up training immediately after their arrival. Between April 1 and May 16, government officials said 1,649 individuals connected with the Olympics had arrived from 80 or so nations and regions. Of that number, 24 were from India, where a virulent mutant strain of the novel coronavirus is now making its presence felt in Japan. Of the 14 who arrived in May, all had shortened self-quarantine periods. Nagatsuma wanted to know why the principle of self-quarantine was waived for those connected with the Olympics. According to officials with the Cabinet Secretariat and Japan Sports Agency, included in the number of foreign arrivals are athletes who took part in pre-Olympic test events in track and field, diving and volleyball held in May. Others who arrived were individuals with the Olympic Broadcasting Services and technicians preparing for the upcoming Games. For such individuals, enforcing the self-quarantine requirement would have led to not meeting their work deadlines, officials said.

More people on Tokyo streets heralds uptick in COVID-19 cases,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"May 29, 2021 at 17:30 JST"," An analysis of pedestrian traffic in Tokyo suggests another uptick in COVID-19 cases may be just around the corner. The study by The Asahi Shimbun was based on the flow of human traffic aggregated by Tokyo-based Agoop Corp., a Softbank Group subsidiary that tracks people’s movements through GPS data on their mobile phones. The Asahi used data from Agoop compiled between April 1, 2020, and May 25, 2021, to calculate the average population per week around 14 rail hubs in the capital. Accepted wisdom to date suggests that if fewer people are on the streets, fresh cases of COVID-19 will show signs of dropping about two weeks later. One finding for the one-week period from April 28, following the declaration three days earlier of a third state of emergency, was that the flow of pedestrian traffic had fallen to 64 percent of the level of the previous week. The number of new COVID-19 cases for the week from May 12 was 90 percent of the level for the week from April 28, while the figure dropped to 73 percent for the week from May 19. However, the Agoop data points to a subsequent increase in the number of people going out. In comparison with the previous week, pedestrian traffic for the week from May 5 increased by 24 percent, while it had increased by 15 percent for the week from May 12. The figure remained unchanged for the week from May 19. While the number of new COVID-19 cases has been falling since the week from April 28, the latest figures indicate another uptick may be possible soon. “A key lesson we've learned so far is the need to maintain restraints on people's movement during the period when new infection cases start to decline so as to further reduce new cases,” noted Koji Wada, a professor of public health at the Otawara, Tochigi Prefecture-based International University of Health and Welfare. “But gaining the understanding of the public will not be possible unless data is presented about the number of vaccinations given and an exit strategy is also clearly presented.” A comparison of total human traffic flow for four-week periods found a 78-percent reduction between April 28 and May 25 compared with the immediate preceding four-week period between March 31 and April 27. But in comparison to the four-week period between April 29, 2020, and May 26, 2020, when the first state of emergency was declared, the figure for April 28 and May 25 represented a 64-percent increase. The figure indicates that the effects of the third state of emergency will likely be weaker than for the first one.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14361113

Komeito vaccine survey shatters rosier outlook by the government,['By KAYOKO GEJI/ Staff Writer'],"May 28, 2021 at 17:25 JST"," Komeito, the junior ruling coalition partner, found that 248 municipalities, nearly double the number in a government survey, doubt they can achieve Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga’s goal of vaccinating all seniors by July 31. Komeito surveyed 1,741 cities, wards, towns and villages through its prefectural chapters nationwide and released the results on May 26. It was conducted largely because a government survey on the COVID-19 inoculation program released on May 21 was vague and potentially misleading. According to that survey, 125 municipalities said it would be difficult to vaccinate all elderly residents by Suga’s targeted date. The government survey did not disclose which municipalities said they were unlikely to achieve the goal. A Komeito official said the party wanted to investigate why those municipalities were falling behind schedule and to help them improve the situation. The party’s survey found that far more municipalities were having difficulties meeting the target. The survey also asked the municipalities for reasons behind their struggles, allowing them to choose multiple answers. Of them, 187, or 75 percent, cited a difficulty in securing medical personnel. A source in the internal affairs ministry, which conducted the government survey, acknowledged that it lacked accuracy. “It’s like the municipalities made a resolution to do their utmost to achieve the target,” the source said.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14360351
People under 65 to get vouchers for vaccinations from mid-June,['By KAYOKO GEJI/ Staff Writer'],"May 28, 2021 at 16:48 JST"," The health ministry has instructed municipalities to start mailing COVID-19 vaccination vouchers to people aged under 65 from mid-June. The ministry recommends that the vouchers be sent to residents in order of age or by area, instead of mailing them all at once, to avoid causing confusion when they make reservations to receive shots. Health care workers top the government’s vaccine priority list, followed by senior citizens aged 65 or older. People with underlying conditions, workers at facilities for elderly people and citizens aged between 60 and 64 are in the third priority group. People not in any of those categories will be vaccinated only after those in the priority groups receive jabs, in principle. But the ministry will allow municipalities to start inoculating residents with pre-existing conditions even before they finish vaccinating senior citizens. The ministry does not require people with underlying conditions to present medical certificates at an inoculation site to prove their eligibility. They only need to write their diseases on medical questionnaires they fill in before receiving a shot. Workers at facilities for elderly people are required to present certificates issued by the facilities, while staff at a vaccination site will check the eligibility of people in the 60-to-64 age group by referring to the date of birth entered on medical questionnaires.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14360221

109 manga artists sketch their daily lives amid COVID-19,['By SHOKO MIFUNE/ Staff Writer'],"May 28, 2021 at 07:00 JST"," The short anthology ""MANGA Day to Day"" is a collection of reflections by 109 manga artists on how the onset of the coronavirus pandemic quickly changed daily life as we know it. The artists collectively inked the first 100 days of the unremitting health crisis in Japan, beginning in April 2020. The cartoonists span genres and generations, including the likes of Tetsuya Chiba, famous for his boxing manga ""Ashita no Joe"" (Tomorrow's Joe), and Moyoco Anno, the creator of “Sugar Sugar Rune.” The project started after Kodansha Ltd. began publishing a similar series of stories and essays by 100 writers on its literary website in May last year. Ryoichi Suzuki, 39, an editor in charge of manga comic magazines at the company, was inspired by the project and decided it could also work well as manga. ""With the coronavirus pandemic still ongoing, it seems like we've been getting used to the situation in recent months,"" Suzuki said. ""When you read these books, I think you can remember the sense of tension we had earlier."" The editor used his personal connections to call on cartoonists to contribute, which resulted in 109 manga artists, including some working in duos, putting their pens to paper. Each artist took turns to create a manga strip taking place over the course of a day from April 1 to July 9, 2020. Their works began being published on Twitter on June 15, and the project generated a huge response. Chiba kicked off the project with the first strip for April 1, drawing the plague-fighting monster Amabie and expressing concerns over the way society has drastically changed in the pandemic. Kenshi Hirokane, known for his long-running ""Kosaku Shima"" series, drew a strip that features him anguishing over whether he should have his manga characters wear masks. In her panels, Kazumi Yamashita wonders how young people are coping with the pandemic when they cannot attend live concerts. Other artists explored a wide variety of techniques and styles to continue the run. While some portray how their characters are coping amid the pandemic, others shared a slice of their own day-to-day lives in essay format. The project ended on Sept. 22 on Twitter. The short works have been compiled into the two-part ""MANGA Day to Day"" anthology by Kodansha, which was released in March this year. Each part is being sold for 1,540 yen ($14). ‘WONDERFUL DAILY LIVES’ WILL RETURN In an interview with The Asahi Shimbun, Tetsuya Chiba, 82, talked about his experiences during the pandemic. Born in Tokyo in 1939, Chiba spent his early childhood in former Manchuria (present-day northeastern China). He is best known for boxing manga ""Ashita no Joe"" (""Tomorrow's Joe""), ""Notari Matsutaro,"" and many other works. Excerpts of the interview follow: Question: How has your life changed in the last year? Tetsuya Chiba: We manga artists can't work unless we hole up in our homes. Or rather, I can get more work done now. But it's a shame not to be able to visit places and meet people for my research. When I worked on the sumo manga ""Notari Matsutaro,"" I went to a sumo stable. As I watched the wrestlers in the training room, I could smell their sweat, the salt sprinkled on the ring and the blood from the abrasions they sustained when they were thrown into a roll. I can create vivid drawings only after I experience those things. Now, I do research on the internet and ask my son to go to places. But he takes photos with more details than I capture, so maybe I can draw better than before. Q: How do you feel now, with seemingly no end in sight to the pandemic? A: I hope we all think about new ways so that we can be a little smarter and become friendlier to the Earth. Nowadays, our values are fundamentally changing. I feel that the times are about to change in a big way. We are in a challenging time, but I have hope that when we come through it, our wonderful daily lives will be back, and I live every day looking forward to seeing it happen.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14350655
OLYMPICS/ Tokyo neighbor Chiba shuts out torch relay over virus concerns,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"May 27, 2021 at 18:48 JST"," Already rerouted and largely bereft of crowds because of resurging novel coronavirus infections, the much-hyped Tokyo Olympic torch relay will now have to bypass an entire prefecture located beside the host city. “In the best interests of local residents’ safety and security, I’ve made the decision to cancel the torch relay on all routes in the prefecture,” Chiba Governor Toshihito Kumagai said at a May 27 news conference. Local leaders and regional organizers have already restricted crowds and taken other anti-coronavirus measures for their legs of the 121-day Olympic torch relay that kicked off in Fukushima Prefecture on March 25. The torch was supposed to be carried in all prefectures in Japan before lighting the Olympic cauldron in Tokyo in July. In prefectures dealing with skyrocketing new COVID-19 cases--namely Osaka, Fukuoka, Hiroshima, Okayama, Hyogo and Kyoto--the routes for the torch runners were changed to avoid public roads. Residents have also been banned from ceremonial events concerning the torch relay. Many runners, including celebrities and star athletes, have withdrawn from the relay, citing the risk of spreading the novel coronavirus. Chiba is the second prefecture to entirely scrap the relay, following Fukuoka in Kyushu. Kumagai said he would inform Tokyo Olympic organizers about the prefecture’s decision by the end of the day. The relay was scheduled to start in the prefecture, which lies just east of the capital, on July 1 from Umihotaru, a rest area on the Tokyo Bay Aqua Line highway with a panoramic ocean view, in Kisarazu. A total of 258 people or groups were slated to participate in Chiba Prefecture’s route until July 3. Instead of the relay, Kumagai said, a torch lighting ceremony will be held behind closed doors on each of the three days. A parking lot of the Makuhari Messe exhibition and convention complex in the city of Chiba is being considered as a site for such a ceremony. The sprawling facility will be a venue for the Tokyo Olympics. “We are still in a situation where residents in the entire prefecture are urged to refrain from going out for nonessential purposes,” Kumagai said. “Letting torchbearers run will cause a movement of people in wide areas and likely further spread the virus.” In Ichinomiya, an oceanside town that will hold surfing competitions for the Summer Games, 14 runners were scheduled to carry the torch on the edge of the water for about 3 kilometers. A town official said the run was canceled because the prefectural government deems the “Swash zone” route a public road. “I get sad thinking about the torchbearers,” Ichinomiya Mayor Masaya Mabuchi said. “But we have no choice, considering the relay cannot be held on any public road.” The torch relay scheduled in Hokkaido on June 13 and 14 could also be canceled. After asking the central government to extend the COVID-19 state of emergency for the northern main island until June 20, Hokkaido Governor Naomichi Suzuki said on May 26, “It will be difficult to hold the relay on public roads once the state of emergency is extended.” A ceremonial event related to the relay is slated for Upopoy, the National Ainu Museum, in Shiraoi on June 13, as well as at Akapla, a square in Sapporo, on June 14. Both events will likely be held without public attendance, the Hokkaido government said. Toyama Prefecture is not under the state of emergency. But the prefecture in central Japan on May 23 logged a record number of new infection cases with 64. Alarmed by the surge, Toyama Governor Hachiro Nitta told reporters on May 26 that the torch relay scheduled for June 2 and 3 in the prefecture will not be held on public roads. Instead, a celebration event will be held each day, he said. “It was a tough decision. I am very sorry for not being able to fulfill the expectations of those who have looked forward to (the relay),” the governor said.

Japan steps up efforts to keep Indian variant out as cases rise,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"May 27, 2021 at 17:40 JST"," Some health experts fear that a coronavirus variant first detected in India and potentially more contagious than one that devastated Britain is slowly gaining a foothold in Japan. The government has been forced to ramp up efforts to keep the virus from India at bay through tightened quarantine measures at airports. It also is trying to slow its spread by early detection of those infected with widespread PCR tests that can detect the L452R mutation in the spike protein found in the India variant. The health ministry announced on May 26 that 29 people have been confirmed infected with the variant from India, known as B.1.617, in Japan as of May 24. Among these were six patients each in Chiba and Osaka prefectures, five patients each in Tokyo and Shizuoka Prefecture and four patients in Hyogo Prefecture. The number rose to 160 as of May 17 for people who tested positive during checks at airports. Tests conducted by the Tokyo metropolitan government showed that the India variant was detected in 14 people as of May 25. Of these, nine became infected after having close contact with people who had traveled overseas, indicating that preventing the virus’s inroad at airports has its limits. Tomoya Saito, head of the Center for Emergency Preparedness and Response for the National Institute of Infectious Diseases (NIID), said the variant may be more widespread than believed. “Given the ratio of positive cases found at airports, the India variant may have made inroads inside Japan in significantly larger numbers than the strain from Britain did” late last year, he said. What is also alarming are reports on cases of those who tested positive for the variant from India despite having not traveled overseas nor had contact with anyone infected. On May 14, the Tokyo Medical and Dental University announced that a patient at its hospital was confirmed with the variant from India. The infected patient is a man in his 40s with an underlying condition. He had no record of traveling abroad nor exposure to anyone infected with the virus from India. “The patient’s case can be interpreted that community infections with that particular variant are widening,” Hiroaki Takeuchi, an associate professor of virology at the university, said, adding that the confirmed cases so far may not necessarily reflect the extent of infections with the Indian strain of the virus in each region. Yoshihiro Takayama, a doctor at Okinawa Prefectural Chubu Hospital who leads the prefecture’s coronavirus response, fears the spread of the variant from India would exacerbate Japan’s battle against the virus. The variant from India is estimated to be more contagious than the strain that was first identified in Britain, a variant that is itself assessed around 30 percent more transmissible than the initial novel coronavirus by the NIID. “If the Indian version swept through the nation, it would be a lot more devastating to the country,” Takayama said. The southernmost prefecture has been placed under a state of emergency. It reported the nation’s highest new cases per 100,000 people over the most recent week on May 26, with 92.88. The prefecture has been pounded by variants that have a mutation known as N501Y, which is most notably seen in the British version, like elsewhere in Japan. In Britain, the Scientific Advisory Group of Emergency, an expert group, suggested in its report on May 13 that it is “a realistic possibly” that the India variant could be up to 50 percent more contagious than the Britain variant. Although Britain’s Public Health of England did not give specific numbers, it also suggested that the India variant is substantially more transmissible than the Britain variant. Scientists raised concerns about a possible drop in antibody levels created among people infected with the initial form of the coronavirus. They point to a possibility that protection provided by a vaccine that was developed based on the original virus could decline. But some studies showed that people who are fully inoculated with the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine are protected against the India virus as well. While the World Health Organization added the virus from India to the list of “variants of concern” to call for caution, the NIID also took a similar step by naming it one of the variants of concern. Variants from Britain, South Africa, Brazil and the Philippines are also on the list. The health ministry is set to conduct a large-scale surveillance by commissioning PCR tests to identify the variant from India to private-sector labs to detect patients and isolate them at an early stage.

Requests pour in for extension of COVID-19 state of emergency,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"May 27, 2021 at 13:58 JST"," Health experts have joined expanding calls from around Japan for Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga to extend the COVID-19 state of emergency beyond the May 31 deadline, saying medical systems remain severely strained. The central government plans to convene a task force meeting on May 28 to make a formal decision on whether to extend the state of emergency, which is currently in place for 10 prefectures A May 27 meeting of Cabinet ministers dealing with the pandemic will decide on the length of the extension. One likely scenario is to continue the emergency declaration until June 20, the deadline now for recently listed Okinawa Prefecture. That new deadline would come one month before the scheduled start of the Tokyo Olympics. On May 26, Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike held a video conference with her counterparts from the neighboring prefectures of Kanagawa, Saitama and Chiba and suggested the extension should be for a month or so. While Tokyo is under the state of emergency, quasi-emergency measures are in place for the three other prefectures. The four governors submitted a request with the central government for an extension of both measures. The governors of Osaka, Kyoto and Hyogo prefectures in the Kansai region, as well as the leaders of Hokkaido, Hiroshima and Okayama prefectures made a similar request for an extension on May 26. The three Kansai governors earlier in the day agreed to continue asking bars and restaurants to refrain from serving alcohol. Fukuoka Prefecture asked for an extension on May 25. Although Aichi Prefecture has not made a formal request to the central government, prefectural officials there also believe an extension is needed. The number of new COVID-19 cases in Tokyo and Osaka has been declining in recent weeks, but the medical care situation remains precarious. Tokyo is the only prefecture under the state of emergency where the hospital bed usage ratio is not at the most serious stage 4 level in excess of 50 percent. The strain on health care systems is one reason experts dealing with the pandemic are recommending that the state of emergency and other anti-virus measures should be kept in place. Health experts also pointed to the still high number of COVID-19 patients with serious symptoms as well as the number of fatalities. Japan had 1,050 patients with serious symptoms on May 1, but the figure had risen to 1,294 by May 24. Sixty-seven deaths from COVID-19 were reported on May 1. The number increased to 86 on May 24. The number of new cases per 100,000 residents over the most recent week has fallen to 32.09 in Tokyo and to 31.76 in Osaka. But in other localities, the number remains high. Hokkaido had a per capita figure of 79.5, while the number for Okinawa was 87.2. Eleven prefectures had numbers at the stage 4 level, leading experts on the government panel to say the health care situation was still very tight.

The 302 cases pushed the southernmost prefecture’s number of new COVID-19 patients per 100,000 residents to 92.88 for the most recent week, the highest figure in Japan. One alarming development is that infection routes were unknown for about 60 percent of the new cases on May 26. In addition, the ratio of hospital beds occupied by COVID-19 patients remains at a high level of 86.4 percent. Okinawa Prefecture so far has had a total of 15,750 COVID-19 cases.

Limiting people’s movement key to holding ‘safe’ Olympics: study,['By HISATOSHI KABATA/ Staff Writer'],"May 25, 2021 at 19:12 JST"," Strict restrictions of movements of people in Tokyo for the Summer Olympics and Paralympics could reduce the spread of novel coronavirus infections to near the same level if the events were called off, researchers said. But a number of other factors must be in place for such a scenario to happen. The projection was made by Taisuke Nakata, an associate professor of public policy, and Daisuke Fujii, a project assistant professor of economics, both of whom are with the University of Tokyo. They said that crowding in the capital would cause far more new COVID-19 cases than the arrival of 100,000-plus people from overseas for the events. In addition to 15,000 athletes, 78,000 officials and workers are expected to arrive from abroad for the Summer Games from July 23 to Aug. 8 and Paralympics from Aug. 24 to Sept. 5. The study premised that 105,000 people would come from overseas, including journalists. Half of them would be vaccinated against virus, while 100 would enter Japan after testing negative at the time of their arrival. The research showed that if a new wave of infections emerged after the Olympic Games, the daily case numbers would peak in mid-October--if the current state of emergency for Tokyo is lifted in the middle of June and if 600,000 vaccine doses are administered daily across the nation. If the Games did not cause any additional increase in economic activity and people’s movements, the number of daily new COVID-19 cases would reach a peak of 842, according to the researchers. If the Olympic and Paralympic Games are called off, the study put the daily count of new cases at 822 in the middle of October. They said the key to stemming the spread of the novel coronavirus is to significantly curb movements of people by avoiding holding public-viewing gatherings and other events during the sports extravaganzas. If people’s movements increased by 2 percent and 6 percent, new daily infections at the peak time would reach 1,046 and 1,600, respectively. Crowds at these heightened levels have been recorded during the cherry blossom viewing season, according to the study.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14357743

Japan says U.S. travel warning for virus won’t hurt Olympians,['THE ASSOCIATED PRESS'],"May 25, 2021 at 16:54 JST"," The Japanese government Tuesday was quick to deny a U.S. warning for Americans to avoid traveling to Japan would have an impact on Olympians wanting to compete in the postponed Tokyo Games. U.S. officials cited a surge in coronavirus cases in Japan caused by virus variants that may even be risks to vaccinated people. They didn’t ban Americans from visiting Japan, but the warnings could affect insurance rates and whether Olympic athletes and other participants decide to join the Games that begin July 23. Most metro areas in Japan are under a state of emergency and expected to remain so through mid-June because of rising serious COVID-19 cases that are putting pressure on the country’s medical care systems. That raises concern about how the country could cope with the arrival of tens of thousands of Olympic participants if its hospitals remain stressed and little of its population is vaccinated. Japan’s Chief Cabinet Secretary Katsunobu Kato told a regular news conference Tuesday that the U.S. warning does not prohibit essential travel and Japan believes the U.S. support for Tokyo’s effort to hold the Olympics is unchanged. “We believe there is no change to the U.S. position supporting the Japanese government’s determination to achieve the Games,” Kato said, adding that Washington has told Tokyo the travel warning is not related to participation of the U.S. Olympic team. The United States Olympic & Paralympic Committee said it still anticipates American athletes will be able to safely compete at the Tokyo Games. Fans coming from abroad were banned from the Tokyo Olympics months ago, but athletes, families, sporting officials from around the world and other stakeholders still amount to a mass influx of international travelers. The Japanese public in opinion surveys have expressed opposition to holding the Games out of safety concerns while most people will not be vaccinated. The U.S. warning from the Atlanta-based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said: “Because of the current situation in Japan even fully vaccinated travelers may be at risk for getting and spreading COVID-19 variants and should avoid all travel to Japan.” The State Department’s warning was more blunt. “Do not travel to Japan due to COVID-19,” it said.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14357698
Osaka to request new extension of COVID-19 state of emergency,['By YUKI KUBOTA/ Staff Writer'],"May 25, 2021 at 16:30 JST"," OSAKA--Osaka Prefecture decided to ask the central government to re-extend the COVID-19 state of emergency for the prefecture because of the continued strain on the health care system. The official decision was made at the prefectural government’s task force meeting on May 25. Osaka Governor Hirofumi Yoshimura has been cautious about the lifting of the emergency declaration for his prefecture scheduled on May 31. The state of emergency for the prefecture was already extended on May 12. “We managed to curb the growth in infections, and (new cases) are now on the decline,” Yoshimura said at the meeting. “But the health care system is still under severe strain.” He told reporters after the meeting that he does not think continuing the state of emergency for only a short period would be enough, although the central government would decide how long the extended measure will last. The prefecture is asking the neighboring Kyoto and Hyogo prefectures, which are also covered by the state of emergency, to jointly seek an extension, according to Osaka prefectural government sources. Osaka Prefecture currently bans bars and restaurants from serving alcohol and asks them to shorten their operating hours. It is also requesting large facilities, such as department stores and movie theaters, to close temporarily at the governor’s discretion. Osaka Mayor Ichiro Matsui said that if the state of emergency continues beyond May 31, the Osaka prefectural government should review its anti-virus measures, which are stricter than those taken in other areas under the emergency declaration. Osaka Prefecture reported 216 new infections on May 24, the second consecutive day the daily count fell below 300. As of May 24, 318 COVID-19 patients in the prefecture were hospitalized with severe symptoms, including 29 who are continuing to receive treatment at beds for patients with moderate symptoms.

Japan to extend quarantine for 6 countries to fight entry of variants,['By TATSUYA SATO/ Staff Writer'],"May 25, 2021 at 15:51 JST"," In a belated attempt to stop the spread of novel coronavirus variants first seen in India, the Japanese government will further strengthen quarantine measures on entrants from six southern Asian countries. Japanese nationals arriving from India, Pakistan, Nepal, Bangladesh, Maldives and Sri Lanka will likely be required to stay at an accommodation facility designated by the quarantine station for 10 days, extended from the current six-day isolation period. They will also be required to be tested for COVID-19 five times, one more than the existing requirement, before and after their entry to Japan. Japan has already banned entries of foreign nationals traveling from these six countries, in principle, regardless of their visa status. But the central government agreed on further tightening border controls, weeks after the Indian variants have already been spreading throughout Japan. Currently, Japanese nationals arriving from these six countries are required to be tested before arrival, upon arrival, three days after entering Japan and six days after entering. But under the newly proposed rule, they will be required to take an additional test on the 10th day after entry. If they test negative for the novel coronavirus, they will then be allowed to move from the designated accommodation facility to their home. But they will still be asked to remain home until the 14th day after entry. “Ideally, they should be quarantined for 14 days” at a designated accommodation facility, said Shigeru Omi, chairman of the government panel of experts dealing with the pandemic, at a news conference on May 21.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14357579

U.S. warns against all travel to Japan as Olympics loom,['THE ASSOCIATED PRESS'],"May 25, 2021 at 09:35 JST"," WASHINGTON--U.S. health officials and the State Department on Monday warned Americans against travel to Japan because of a surge in coronavirus cases in the country, which is preparing to host the Olympics in just two months. The twin alerts don’t ban U.S. citizens from visiting the country, but they could have an impact on insurance rates for travelers and may factor into decisions by Olympic athletes and spectators on whether to compete in or attend the games, which are due to start in July. There was no immediate indication as to what effect the warnings might have on would-be Olympic-goers. “Travelers should avoid all travel to Japan,” the Atlanta-based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in a new COVID-19 update. “Because of the current situation in Japan even fully vaccinated travelers may be at risk for getting and spreading COVID-19 variants and should avoid all travel to Japan.” The State Department's warning, which followed the CDC alert, was more blunt. “Do not travel to Japan due to COVID-19,” it said in the announcement, which raised the department's travel alert from Level 3 — Reconsider travel — to Level 4 — Do not travel. The previous alert was issued on April 21. The United States Olympic & Paralympic Committee said it still anticipates that American athletes will be able to safely compete at the Tokyo Games. “We feel confident that the current mitigation practices in place for athletes and staff by both the USOPC and the Tokyo Organizing Committee, coupled with the testing before travel, on arrival in Japan, and during Games time, will allow for safe participation of Team USA athletes this summer,” the committee said in a statement Monday. Earlier Monday, Japan mobilized military doctors and nurses to give shots to older adults in two major cities, as the government tried desperately to accelerate its vaccination rollout and curb coronavirus infections before it hosts the Olympics. That move came amid growing calls for the games to be canceled. Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga is determined to hold the Olympics in Tokyo beginning on July 23, after a one-year delay, and has made an ambitious pledge to finish vaccinating the country’s 36 million older people by the end of July. Japan has recorded just over 12,000 COVID-19 deaths — good by global standards, but poor in Asia — but Tokyo and Osaka and several other areas are under a state of emergency until May 31 that is likely to be extended.

"Mass inoculation of seniors starts in Tokyo, Osaka and elsewhere",['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"May 24, 2021 at 17:30 JST"," Seniors who received COVID-19 shots at mass vaccination centers that opened in Tokyo and Osaka on May 24 expressed relief at getting in quicker than at sites operated by their municipalities. In Tokyo, a resident of Suginami Ward was administered a jab at 8 a.m. at the inoculation center set up in a central government building in Chiyoda Ward. The man, who will turn 65 this year, said he canceled an appointment he had made with his ward as he could secure a slot at the mass vaccination site, part of the central government program. “I am feeling safer since I got my first jab,” said the man, who will be traveling to Indonesia to teach Japanese when the novel coronavirus pandemic is brought under control. The shots at the Tokyo and Osaka sites for people aged 65 or older are being given by doctors and nurses with the Self-Defense Forces. Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga is pushing to complete the inoculations of Japan’s 36 million seniors by the end of July. On May 24, 5,000 doses and 2,500 doses will have been administered at each site, respectively. Vaccinations will be doubled at both locations starting from next week. For this week, those eligible to get vaccinated are seniors living in the capital’s 23 wards and in Osaka. The eligibility will be expanded to all the elderly in Tokyo and Osaka Prefecture from next week. At the Osaka location, a 69-year-old man in Osaka who cares for his mother, 96, was among the first recipients. “I was worried about being infected with the coronavirus as I heard that a variant is more transmissible,” he said. “I feel at ease now after enduring many days of being anxious.” The Osaka vaccination center was set up in the Osaka International Convention Center in the city’s Kita Ward. A free bus ride is being offered to the site from JR Osaka Station and Nankai Electric Railway Corp.’s Namba Station. Many prefectures are also moving to set up their own vaccination centers to accelerate the vaccine rollout. The Aichi prefectural government set up two mass vaccination locations in the prefecture--one in Fujita Health University Hospital in Toyoake and the other at Nagoya Airport in Toyoyama, with a capacity of a combined 3,000 jabs a day.

Prefectures rush to set up own mass inoculation sites for seniors,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"May 24, 2021 at 16:50 JST"," With concerns rising about the snail's pace of the COVID-19 vaccine rollout, Osaka, Kyoto and 13 other prefectures have either opened or plan to open mass vaccination centers for seniors, according to an Asahi Shimbun survey. In addition, Tokyo, Hokkaido and 15 other prefectures are considering following suit. However, a challenge cited by most of these prefectures is securing large numbers of health care workers to administer doses, the survey showed. Municipalities across the nation began the rollout for people 65 or older on April 12 as the main organizers of the inoculation program. But a calculation by The Asahi Shimbun, based on data from the Cabinet Office and official figures of registration of residents as of January 2020, showed that the share of seniors who have received at least one dose totaled only 2.6 percent as of May 16. Japan has an elderly population of about 36 million. Prefectural authorities’ efforts to set up their own vaccination centers comes as large-scale vaccination centers, which are operated by the Self-Defense Forces, opened in Tokyo and Osaka for the elderly on May 24. Tokyo and the three neighboring prefectures of Saitama, Chiba and Kanagawa are home to 9 million seniors. Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga set a target of completing immunizations of residents 65 and older by the end of July. The central government is pushing the mass immunization drive under a slogan of “1 million jabs a day.” It plans to provide prefectural authorities with subsidies to set up vaccination centers supplied with U.S. drug maker Moderna Inc.’s vaccine, whose use was authorized in Japan on May 21. The prefectures that have either opened or plan to open mass sites are Miyagi, Gunma, Saitama, Fukui, Aichi, Mie, Kyoto, Osaka, Hyogo, Tottori, Hiroshima, Tokushima, Fukuoka, Nagasaki and Miyazaki. Of these, Miyagi, Gunma and Aichi prefectures were expected to begin administering doses on May 24, according to the study. Miyagi’s daily target is 2,100 doses, while Gunma began with 100-200 jabs and will eventually increase that number to 1,000. Aichi aims to achieve 3,000 shots by setting up two mass vaccination sites. Saitama will open such a venue on June 1, while Tokushima is eying an early June opening. Kyoto, Osaka and Hyogo plan to set up centers in the middle of June. The targeted daily doses widely vary from one prefecture to the next. Tottori said its target is from 200 to 400 per day. Hyogo said it will establish a mass vaccination center to make doses available to residents with underlying health conditions as soon as possible by completing the rollout for the elderly. Saitama is seeking to make up for local governments that are unlikely to finish the vaccination schedule by the end of July. Gunma will open a mass vaccination center in an area where the ratio of doctors and nurses is low on a per capita basis. Niigata, one of the 17 prefectures considering mass vaccination centers, said it will be a big plus for the prefecture to set up a mass site as the effort secures supplies of Moderna vaccines from the central government. Tokyo is still considering setting up its own center for the elderly. But Tokyo officials said on May 21 that they will use the former site of the Tsukiji fish market in Chuo Ward to inoculate police officers and firefighters in the capital.

The advisory was in the form of an email sent May 19 by the Itako public health center in Itako to the Hokota city government in the prefecture and Hokota's local agricultural cooperative. The intention was to share it among farmers hiring foreign workers. Citing numerous COVID-19 cases in foreign communities and farms where many foreign nationals worked, the document urged farmers to remember “to wear masks when conversing with foreigners” and “not dine with foreigners.” After being alerted to the advisory on May 21, officials in charge of infectious diseases at the prefectural government urged the Itako public health center to cancel the guidance. “The advisory may cause misunderstandings because it targeted foreigners,” a prefectural official said. Hokota, with a population of 48,000, had a high ratio of foreign nationals among its residents. Most of them work as technical intern trainees who came to Japan from developing countries. The city is famed for its melons and other fruits, as well as agricultural produce. (This article was written by Kazumichi Kubota and Keiji Maruyama.)",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14356299

The government has signed contracts with Moderna for enough doses for 50 million people, and the vaccine is expected to be used at mass inoculation programs in Tokyo and Osaka from May 24. The contract with AstraZeneca is for enough doses for 60 million people, but due to reports from abroad of the vaccine causing side effects in rare cases that lead to thrombosis, further studies will be conducted before deciding who it can be administered to. The two vaccines were given the green light under a special approval procedure based on the results of clinical testing overseas, such as the vaccine jointly developed by U.S. pharmaceutical company Pfizer Inc. and German biocommerce company BioNTech, which is now being used on senior citizens. Moderna’s vaccine must be stored at minus 20 degrees, and like Pfizer’s vaccine, uses genetic material called Messenger RNA.

Formal approval of the two additional vaccines is expected Friday by a broader vaccine policy panel, officials said. Health Minister Norihisa Tamura said approval of the additional vaccines will help speed up inoculations. Japan has administered one or more vaccine doses to roughly 5 million people, or just 4 percent of the population. As the government pushes to host the Olympics in about two months, accelerating vaccinations is key to warding off mounting public concern about the safety of the event. Recent polls have found that more than 80 percent of Japanese oppose hosting the Olympics this summer. Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga has pledged to finish vaccinating the country’s roughly 36 million elderly population by the end of July, when the games are to be held. However, a government survey of 1,741 municipalities released last week found around 15 percent will not be able to meet the deadline. On Monday, the government will open mass-vaccination sites in two of the country’s biggest metropolitan areas, Tokyo and Osaka, with the goal of administering vaccines to up to 15,000 elderly people a day. Moderna shots are to be used at the sites.

Kumamoto OKs local officials to get vaccine shots if canceled,['By SHOMEI NAGATSUMA/ Staff Writer'],"May 20, 2021 at 18:51 JST"," KUMAMOTO--To justify getting COVID-19 shots ahead of the elderly or medical personnel, Kumamoto officials here have made the practice permissible for local government heads and others if there are cancellations of appointments. The Kumamoto prefectural government, its mayors’ association and other groups made the guidelines on May 19 to allow municipal heads and others to receive vaccine shots in the event of cancellations. It marks the first time in Japan that such a guideline on vaccinations has been created, according to a prefectural official. Recently, municipal government leaders in Ibaraki and Hyogo prefectures and others evoked controversy when it was found they had received jabs ahead of the elderly and medical personnel. They justified the shots by saying that there were cancellations of vaccinations or they were in charge of their town's vaccination program. When Kumamoto Governor Ikuo Kabashima exchanged ideas with the head of its mayors’ association and head of the town and village association on May 14, he disclosed his plan for the prefecture to make its own rules to avoid similar criticism. “If rules are set and people get canceled vaccine shots based on the rules, there will be no problems,” Kabashima said. Takashi Kimura, vice governor of the prefecture, said at a May 19 news conference that there is a certain ""mood"" among the public that local officials should not get preferential treatment, but there may be some necessity for doing so. “But they should not receive shots behind people’s backs,"" Kimura said. ""I want them to get vaccinated after their policies are made public in advance. The guidelines for Kumamoto designate who will be eligible for vaccinations when inoculation centers receive unexpected cancellations. Those eligible include workers at inoculation centers, heads of municipal governments, local officials who are in charge of anti-COVID-19 measures and day care personnel who work with the elderly or disabled people.

Experts: Virus numbers still too high to lift state of emergency,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"May 20, 2021 at 15:29 JST"," New COVID-19 cases have decreased in some areas of Japan, but not enough to warrant a lifting of the state of emergency as scheduled on May 31, health experts have warned. They said many affected places have yet to show they can emerge from the most serious stage of the health crisis. “It is too early to judge now, but lifting the emergency may be difficult,” a member of a health ministry panel of experts on COVID-19 said a May 19 meeting. Tokyo, Osaka, Hyogo, Kyoto, Aichi, Fukuoka, Okayama, Hokkaido and Hiroshima prefectures are covered under the latest state of emergency to stem the spread of novel coronavirus infections. Under one of the criteria set by a government task force, the state of emergency can be lifted only after the number of new COVID-19 cases drops below the most serious stage of a four-level classification. Stage 4 for this category is a situation in which there are 25 or more new infections per 100,000 people over a week. Cabinet Secretariat data as of May 18 showed the figure for Hokkaido was 72 and 64 for Fukuoka Prefecture, while the numbers exceeded 50 in Aichi, Osaka, Okayama and Hiroshima prefectures. In Tokyo, it was 38, about 40 percent of the peak in January, when the capital was struck by the third wave of infections. Data compiled by The Asahi Shimbun showed that on March 1, when the second state of emergency was lifted for Osaka Prefecture, the prefecture’s number was 5.7. On March 22, after Tokyo emerged from the second state of emergency, the figure for the capital was 15.3. Health experts said the number of new cases has not declined substantially despite more stringent anti-coronavirus measures being taken under the state of emergency or for pre-emergency periods. They said more contagious variants have taken root and are causing numerous outbreaks. Shigeru Omi, an infectious disease expert who heads the government task force, said the state of emergency should not be lifted when new case numbers are hovering at high levels. “It is crucial to first make sure the infection trajectory is on stage 3 and steadily moving toward stage 2,” he said at a May 7 news conference. A stage 3 situation is when 15 or more new cases per 100,000 people are reported over a week. Some experts said the bar should be set even higher for Tokyo to prevent a quick rebound in infections in the densely populated capital. They suggested that Tokyo’s daily count of new cases should be down to around 100 before the state of emergency is lifted. The capital reported 766 new cases on May 19 and 843 on May 20. With the exception of Tokyo, health care systems have been stretched in all prefectures under the state of emergency. Half or more of their hospital beds for COVID-19 patients are occupied, putting the prefectures at stage 4 in that category. The situation is particularly dire in Fukuoka and Okayama prefectures, where more than 80 percent of the beds are filled. In Osaka Prefecture, the number of hospitalized COVID-19 patients is more than five times the lowest figure for stage 4--30 or more patients per 100,000 people. Fukuoka Prefecture has reported more than triple the lowest number for stage 4 categorization. Also disturbing is a surge in the number of COVID-19 patients in serious condition, with the national total hitting a record 1,293 on May 18. The collective number of such cases for the Kansai prefectures of Osaka, Hyogo and Kyoto stood at 493, 39 fewer than from May 1. But some experts suspect that figures for severely ill patients in some prefectures, including Osaka, may be underreported because of the lack of hospital beds secured for them. As for Tokyo and the three neighboring prefectures of Saitama, Kanagawa and Chiba, serious COVID-19 cases rose by 52 to 216. The remaining 40 prefectures in Japan accounted for 584 serious cases, 230 more than the number on May 1.

During a period from the day of the inoculation until Day 13, the number of people who contracted the virus per 100,000 people was 1.26. But from Day 14 to Day 20, the number fell to 0.53. The number continued declining to 0.49 between Day 21 and Day 27, and 0.18 after Day 28. The number started declining after around Day 12, the institute said. In general, it takes a certain number of days after receiving a vaccine shot for a recipient to develop neutralizing antibodies that help prevent infections after inoculations.

Researchers create antibodies to protect against virus variants,['By SHIGEKO SEGAWA/ Staff Writer'],"May 18, 2021 at 18:13 JST"," Researchers succeeded in quickly creating neutralizing antibodies that can render the novel coronavirus ineffective, raising hopes for a possible medicine to treat COVID-19. A team of researchers at Hiroshima University, Kyoto University and other institutions also confirmed the effectiveness of the antibodies against coronavirus variants, which are likely to be more contagious than the original strain of the virus or reduce vaccines’ efficacy. “With blood samples collected from several survivors of COVID-19, we can now make neutralizing antibodies in just 10 days or so,” said Tomoharu Yasuda, a professor of immunology at Hiroshima University and a member of the research team. “We hope the antibodies will help prevent patients from becoming seriously ill and develop medicines to treat those with serious symptoms.” Patients who contracted the virus and recovered from the disease have antibodies in their blood produced by immune cells. Neutralizing antibodies bind to the virus and help prevent it from entering a cell. Scientists around the globe are racing to develop neutralizing antibodies since they can be used as medicines to treat COVID-19. The team analyzed blood samples collected from patients who recovered from the disease. It confirmed that patients with serious symptoms are more likely to have neutralizing antibodies generated in their blood than those with mild symptoms. The researchers then chose candidate immune cells, which produce neutralizing antibodies, from blood samples of four patients who were formerly seriously ill. They extracted a gene that produces antibodies from the selected immune cells and amplified the gene to create neutralizing antibodies. From those antibodies, the team picked ones that bind strongly to the virus strain that caused the initial outbreak of the virus in the Chinese city of Wuhan. The researchers found 97 percent of the antibodies also bind to the British variant, which is thought to be more transmissible, while 63 percent adhere to the South African variant, which is likely to make vaccines less effective. They confirmed that even a small amount of the antibodies that attach themselves to the British and South African variants is effective at staving off the virus. The team said it takes only 10 days or so to make neutralizing antibodies as the researchers successfully speeded up the process. The team added that it wants to create neutralizing antibodies that can protect people against the Indian variant, which is feared to be even more contagious.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14352539

Experts: Speed of vaccine rollout risks 4 more emergencies,['By KENJI TAMURA/ Senior Staff Writer'],"May 17, 2021 at 18:40 JST"," Japan will likely need to issue four more emergency declarations by April 2022 if its COVID-19 vaccination program does not significantly pick up the pace, experts warn. Researchers have crunched the numbers and are now calling on the government to inoculate citizens four times faster than the current speed to bring the pandemic under control. The study was done by Yasuharu Tokuda, who heads the Muribushi Okinawa Center for Teaching Hospitals, and Toshikazu Kuniya, an associate professor of mathematical biology at Kobe University. “The results of simulations may vary depending on other anti-virus measures, but the speed of inoculations still needs to be greatly accelerated,” Tokuda said. “I want the government to swiftly create an environment to realize that.” The researchers based their calculations on data of COVID-19 cases reported between Jan. 14, 2020, and April 20 this year, assuming that the government will issue a fresh state of emergency when the daily number of new infections tops 5,000 nationwide and will then lift the emergency declaration once the count dips below 1,000. Using a mathematical model, the researchers estimated what the infection situation will look like if the vaccine rollout continues at the pace seen around mid-April, when about 220,000 shots were being administered per day. They also took into account the spread of coronavirus variants. If the speed of the vaccination program remains unchanged, daily cases would exceed 5,000 around July, forcing the government to issue a state of emergency four more times by April next year, the study results showed. Even if people receive jabs twice as fast as that, three additional emergency declarations would still be needed. If the vaccination speed is four times as fast, the government would still have to issue another state of emergency around the end of July. But it would not likely face a surge in new infections after that. Administering 1 million shots a day is believed to be more than enough to vaccinate people four times faster than the current pace. The researchers published their modeling before the study was peer-reviewed to make the results quickly available to the public.

"Seniors fill up slots fast for 1st mass vaccination in Tokyo, Osaka",['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"May 17, 2021 at 18:35 JST"," Senior citizens snapped up appointments for Tokyo and Osaka's planned mass COVID-19 vaccinations as the Defense Ministry debuted online reservations for jabs on May 17. Some 21,000 of the 50,000 slots made available for the Tokyo site were filled 45 minutes after bookings began at 11 a.m. All 25,000 slots at the Osaka site had been booked 26 minutes after reservations were accepted, from around 1 p.m. People age 65 or older who have received a vaccination slip issued by their local governments can make reservations for the first dose only. They will be notified about the schedule for their second dose when they show up for the first shot. The slots made available on May 17 are expected to cover the vaccinations over a week from May 24, when the Tokyo and Osaka centers are scheduled to open. Japan has a population of 36 million who are 65 or older, designated a priority group for vaccination. Immunization of senior citizens has been under way under a program implemented by local governments. People in that age group, in Tokyo’s 23 wards and Osaka, are eligible for doses at the two sites, which will be operated by the Self-Defense Forces. While the central government intends to accelerate inoculations through the mass vaccination centers, it cautioned the public against double bookings as central and local government systems were not linked up. “As our systems are not equipped to remove double bookings, people seeking vaccinations at the SDF mass vaccination centers should make sure that they have not booked for doses provided by their local authorities,” Chief Cabinet Secretary Katsunobu Kato said on May 17. Bookings are accepted online only through dedicated sites and through the SDF's account on the Line messaging app. SDF medical staff will administer doses of U.S. drugmaker Moderna Inc.’s vaccine at the two sites over about three months. Applicants, to secure their appointments, need to type in a number assigned to each individual by local governments. To prevent the booking sites from crashing due to floods of reservations, applicants for the Tokyo venue were limited to residents of the capital's 23 wards and to Osaka at the Osaka site. Elderly people in other parts of Tokyo and Osaka Prefecture, in addition to those in Tokyo's 23 wards and Osaka, will be allowed to book slots from May 24 for doses to be administered between May 31 and June 6. From May 31, senior citizens in Saitama, Chiba, and Kanagawa prefectures can secure their appointments for the Tokyo center and those in Kyoto and Hyogo prefectures may book them for the Osaka center.

Osaka death toll from COVID-19 dwarfs all other prefectures,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"May 16, 2021 at 18:54 JST"," Only 15 days into May, Osaka Prefecture reported a record 487 deaths from COVID-19 for any month. Surging numbers of novel coronavirus infection have stretched the prefecture's health care system to the limit and few rooms are available for new patients. An Asahi Shimbun tally shows that the death toll in the prefecture accounts for more than 20 percent of the nation’s overall fatalities since March. The prefecture has been in the grip of a fourth wave of infections that started in March, local authorities say. From April, accumulative deaths in the prefecture represented more than 30 percent of all fatalities across the nation. Since the middle of February, daily deaths from COVID19 had remained below double digits in Osaka Prefecture. But the toll began spiking sharply from late April. In May, more than 15 deaths were logged per day. Then on May 11, the prefecture reported 55 deaths, a record for a single 24-hour period. Deaths from COVID-19 around the nation since March 1 stood at 3,403 as of May 13. With 751 fatalities, Osaka Prefecture accounted for 22.1 percent of the national total. The figure rises to 32.2 percent if overall deaths since April 1 are taken into account. The average age of patients who died from the third wave of infections from Oct. 10 to late February was 78.0, prefectural officials said. Of these deaths, 98.1 percent of the patients were aged 60 or older. But in the current fourth wave, the average age of fatal cases dropped to 75.2 due to a sharp increase in the number of patients in their 50s or younger who succumbed to the disease. The ratio of patients in their 60s or older who died came to 93.1 percent. Prefectural officials attribute the growing death toll to the steep rise in new cases. Between April 13 and May 2, daily new cases topped 1,000 except for April 19 and April 26. The ratio of deaths among COVID-19 patients during the fourth wave stands at 1.0 percent, compared with 2.6 percent during the third wave. However, the number of deaths surged in conjunction with the sharp rise in new infections. Prefectural officials say they believe a variant, called B.1.1.7, which was first identified in Britain late last year triggered the fourth wave. This mutant is more contagious and more likely to result in death, according to reports from overseas. The pace of rise in the number of serious cases grew about three-fold from the third wave of infections in the prefecture, leaving hospitals with few unoccupied beds. As of May 12, the number of patients who have been hospitalized represented only 10 percent of people who tested positive for the novel coronavirus in the prefecture. About 15,000 people were staying at home without medical care at hospitals as of May 15. Osaka Governor Hirofumi Yoshimura warned that fatalities could surge in coming weeks, given the high number of patients denied access to care at hospitals.

"In abrupt shift, 3 more prefectures tapped for state of emergency",['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"May 14, 2021 at 18:00 JST"," The government suddenly changed its plans and decided to add Hokkaido, Okayama and Hiroshima to the list of prefectures under the COVID-19 state of emergency from May 16 to 31. At a May 14 meeting, the government’s expert panel on COVID-19 approved the new plan, which is expected to receive formal approval at the government’s task force meeting later in the day. Under the initial proposal made the previous day, the government planned to apply pre-emergency measures in the five prefectures of Gunma, Ishikawa, Okayama, Hiroshima and Kumamoto to stem the spread of the novel coronavirus. However, infections are rising across the nation, particularly in Hokkaido, Okayama and Hiroshima prefectures. Hokkaido has already been placed under the pre-emergency measures, but new COVID-19 cases there continue to increase, reaching a daily record of 712 on May 13, including 499 in the capital of Sapporo. The Hokkaido government has asked the central government to issue the state of emergency for Sapporo. The pre-emergency measures will still be issued for Gunma, Ishikawa and Kumamoto prefectures. These anti-virus measures will apply from May 16 to June 13, according to the new plan. Earlier this month, the state of emergency was extended until May 31 for Tokyo, Osaka, Hyogo and Kyoto prefectures. It also covers Aichi and Fukuoka prefectures. The initial proposal was made at a May 13 ministerial meeting that was attended by Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga and health minister Norihisa Tamura. Kazuhiro Tateda, a member of the expert panel and a professor at Toho University, explained how things changed. “I repeatedly said that no matter how you looked at Hokkaido, the situation is serious, and Okayama and Hiroshima, too,” he told reporters after the meeting on May 14. “I am glad that the government’s proposal was changed.” Tateda said other panel members also described Hokkaido, Okayama and Hiroshima prefectures as being in a serious situation, and that they should be immediately placed under the state of emergency. Yasutoshi Nishimura, who heads the central government’s efforts in dealing with the COVID-19 crisis, listened to the panel’s opinions, Tateda said. “Nishimura then left for a Cabinet meeting and talked about it with Suga there,” he said. “Nishimura came back here and said that he would submit a new proposal.” Under the state of emergency, businesses that serve alcohol, provide karaoke services or allow customers to bring in alcohol are asked to close their operations. That request, however, was eased for commercial outlets with a floor space of 1,000 square meters or more. They are allowed to stay open until 8 p.m. Venues for sports and other performances are asked to end such events by 9 p.m. Under eased rules, the venues can be filled to 50 percent of capacity, but only up to 5,000 people. Governors facing still high numbers of new cases have been given more flexibility on the measures, such as whether to continue asking large commercial outlets to shut operations and imposing more restrictions on events. The central government plans to restrict the business closure request in Hokkaido to areas where the local government was planning to apply pre-emergency measures. The pre-emergency measures are intended to prevent prefectures from entering the most serious stage 4 situation, which indicates an explosive growth in infections and would place them under a state of emergency. Categories in the 4-stage scale include hospital bed capacity.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14349630

The mayors of Shirosato, Ibaraki Prefecture, and Kamikawa, Hyogo Prefecture, both received vaccinations although neither are 65 or older or medical personnel, who are eligible for the jabs. Shirosato Mayor Osamu Katono, 42, revealed on May 13 that he had been vaccinated against COVID-19 in late April. He and 11 other town officials, including senior members and receptionists of vaccination centers, got inoculated because there were cancellations of vaccinations for medical personnel. After the media reported the story, Katono held a news conference. The mayor said that he received a vaccine shot on April 28. On April 26 and 28, 162 medical workers in the town were scheduled to get inoculated, but 12 canceled their appointments. In the event of cancellations, about 10 town officials were supposed to get the shots, but there were more cancellations than expected, according to the mayor. He said as he is in charge of the town’s vaccination program, “he received a shot so as not to bring administrative activities and vaccination projects to a standstill.” “I did not receive a high priority on the vaccinations,"" Katono said, adding, “I could be called a member of medical personnel because I established medical clinics to become vaccination centers. I followed the government’s notice.” In Hyogo Prefecture, Sogo Yamana, Kamikawa town mayor, 62, also received a vaccination on May 6, the first day of the town's group vaccination program for people aged 65 or older, although he was not eligible. “I have received one because I am in charge of crisis management,” he told The Asahi Shimbun on May 12. “I apologize for causing concerns and a disturbance among town residents.” According to Yamana, he considered the infection risk he is exposed to at Kanzaki Municipal General Hospital, which he founded and visits every week to attend meetings. He asked the deputy mayor in late April, “Can we make good use of vaccine doses for appointments that have been canceled or which will be wasted?” Yamana asked the deputy mayor to talk to hospital officials to allow him to be inoculated. The chief clerk of the hospital replied, “We can use canceled doses for him,” so Yamana decided to get a shot.

Study: Pfizer vaccine protects against variants of coronavirus,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"May 13, 2021 at 18:22 JST"," About 90 percent of people fully inoculated by the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine are well protected from variants of the novel coronavirus, having produced antibodies stimulated to better fight them off, Japanese researchers said on May 12. The vaccine is the only one currently available in Japan. A team of researchers at Yokohama City University reported the vaccine has a high efficacy against variants after analyzing how it protects against the original form of the virus and seven types of variants, including those believed to be highly contagious and can elude the immune system. The study includes the variant first detected in Britain, one identified in South Africa, one that has spread throughout Brazil and one raging in India. “The vaccine will very likely control the variants that have been identified so far,” said Takeharu Yamanaka, a professor of health data science at the university’s medical school. The same day, the National Institute of Infectious Diseases said the strain that devastated Britain now makes up more than 90 percent of the coronavirus infections discovered across Japan. Yokohama City University’s study involved 105 health care workers who tested negative for the virus before the study and were fully vaccinated between March and April. Their average age was 42. Researchers collected their blood samples prior to the first shot, and then again after the first and second shots, to examine whether enough neutralizing antibodies, a subset of immune system fighters, were produced in their blood to help prevent infection. Through the university’s own technology, researchers used virus-like particles that come with the coronavirus surface proteins, rather than the genuine coronavirus itself. The study found that after their first jab, 57 percent of the subjects produced enough neutralizing antibodies to protect themselves from the original version of the coronavirus, while that was not the case with variants. But after the second shot, 94 percent of the subjects were protected against the variant detected in Britain and 97 percent against the type identified in India. More than 90 percent of the people on average were protected against each of all variants. Researchers also found that separately from the 105 subjects, six people who already had antibodies to the novel coronavirus had generated enough neutralizing antibodies after receiving the first shot. To determine whether a sufficient number of neutralizing antibodies were produced, the team used the number required to stave off the original form of the coronavirus. Yamanaka noted there is a possibility that more neutralizing antibodies may be needed to defend against variants. The team plans to study how long the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine will be effective against variants, and how long vaccines from other drug makers will protect against variants. Apart from Pfizer, Japan has signed a deal with foreign drug makers Moderna and AstraZeneca over vaccine supplies.

Municipal governments and hospitals nationwide started accepting reservations for the vaccine from people 65 years old or older on May 12. However, demand has far exceeded supply of the vaccine in many areas. Seniors have said they are only getting busy signals when they phone their local governments to make reservations.

"Ad with bamboo spears, virus was message ‘not to repeat mistakes’",['By TAKAHIRO KAWAMURA/ Staff Writer'],"May 13, 2021 at 16:56 JST"," A Tokyo-based publishing company defended its two-page newspaper advertisement that used World War II imagery to send a blunt message to the government about its handling of the COVID-19 pandemic. The ad by Takarajimasha Inc. read: “No vaccines. No medications. Are we supposed to fight with bamboo spears? If this goes on, we will be killed by politics.” It carried a picture reminiscent of wartime military drills for school children to learn to fight against the enemy with bamboo spears. In a prepared statement, a representative of the company said the ad was intended to send the government “a strong message that we should not repeat the same mistakes.” “People’s frustration with the central government, which has kept forcing people to show self-restraint, has reached a peak while the development, securing and administering of a vaccine has been delayed,” the representative said. The advertisement, which appeared in the morning print editions of three national newspapers—Asahi, Yomiuri and Nikkei—on May 11, generated a buzz on social media. Much of the reaction was positive, with some posters saying, “It’s dead-on” or “Thank you for saying that.” But others criticized the ad for likening anti-virus measures to unscientific bamboo-spear training. The representative explained: “The current circumstances in which only citizens are forced to bear the burden by wearing masks, washing hands, avoiding crowded places and showing self-restraint overlap with the unscientific war strategy during World War II that forced even little girls to do bamboo-spear training.” A large red spherical object resembling the novel coronavirus appeared in the center of the advertisement. In a smaller font, the ad read: “We are tricked. What was the last year after all? How long do we need to show self-restraint? We don’t want this game of patience anymore.” It continued: “Don’t make excuses, period. (It) just goes on torturing us, and nothing has changed. It’s high time to voice our anger.” Some observers said the red virus at the center made the ad look like Hinomaru, Japan’s rising sun flag. The representative said the advertisement was designed to look like a child was spearing the virus, and that any resemblance to the national flag was unintentional. The ad never specified the object of the criticism, but it was widely seen as a sharp rebuke of the central government’s response to the novel coronavirus crisis. The representative confirmed that the ad was intended to relay a message urging the government to learn from its past failures in preparing for or taking effective action against the virus, and to make the maximum effort and offer thorough explanations from now. Since 1998, Takarajimasha has occasionally placed advertisements that included social messages. In January this year, the company created an ad that featured the phrase, “It is said that the spread of infections by close contact with (a patient) is individual responsibility.” The representative said the company places such advertisements “not as an organ of public opinion or of a publishing firm,” but it rather considers the practice as “a role of a company.” “It’s the company’s pleasure to use advertisements that make people feel something and give them an opportunity to think about something,” the representative said.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14347702
Japan entry ban on India includes foreigners with residency status,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"May 13, 2021 at 15:11 JST"," Japan will ban entry to foreign nationals from India, Pakistan and Nepal, including those with residency status in Japan, amid a surge in COVID-19 cases there. The government announced on May 12 that the measure will start at midnight on May 13, targeting foreigners who have stayed in one of the three countries within 14 days before arriving in Japan. Even spouses of Japanese nationals will be barred from entering the country, in principle, according to the Foreign Ministry. But people in such categories as permanent residents and spouses of Japanese nationals who have left Japan by May 13 with re-entry permission are exempted from the ban. Japanese nationals will continue to be allowed to enter Japan, according to the ministry. The government on May 10 tightened border controls against entrants from India, Pakistan and Nepal by increasing the number of COVID-19 tests they must undergo before and after their arrival. Some 4,000 travelers from the three nations entered Japan in April, the government said at a May 12 meeting of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party.

"Around Japan,  a COVID-19 ‘state of emergency’ in name only",['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"May 12, 2021 at 18:05 JST"," A “ho-hum” attitude was expressed among commuters, businesses and the general public on the first day of the extended state of emergency over the COVID-19 pandemic. Many said the declaration has no effect on their lives. Some were elated that the government allowed for an easing of anti-virus measures, but others questioned if those relaxed rules were sending a mixed signal on the seriousness of the novel coronavirus situation. The state of emergency, initially scheduled to end on May 11, was extended in Tokyo, Osaka, Kyoto and Hyogo prefectures until May 31. Aichi and Fukuoka prefectures were added to the list from May 12. Just after 8 a.m. on May 12, commuters and high school students formed lengthy lines at the ticket gates of JR Ueno Station in Tokyo. “I am disappointed that the (state of emergency) has been extended,” a 55-year-old accountant said at the station. He said the central government’s decision to extend the state of emergency “does not particularly change the nature of my work.” “That is why I am commuting today, just like I did yesterday,” he said. Although government authorities have urged people to work from home, he said he is allowed to telework only once or twice a month. “I don’t think the virus will be contained soon unless (the government) imposes a lockdown at least,” he said. “I think everybody is fed up with the same old routine.” Tokyo is now under its third state of emergency. All of them have been extended. But under this extension, the central government allowed an easing of requests for businesses to restrict crowd sizes or shut down. The central government planned to reopen five national facilities in Ueno, including the National Museum of Nature and Science, on May 12. However, the decision was reversed on May 11 after the Tokyo metropolitan government sent a strong request to the Cultural Affairs Agency. On May 12, a “closed” sign appeared at the entrance of the Tokyo National Museum in Ueno Park. Among the three Kansai prefectures of Osaka, Kyoto and Hyogo, large-scale commercial facilities are taking different approaches under the extended state of emergency. Department stores in Kyoto and Hyogo prefectures had closed all floors except the ones that sold essential goods, such as food. But now, floors and sections selling nonessential items are open on weekdays. Daimaru Kyoto in Kyoto’s Shimogyo Ward reopened all shops. About 20 people waited in line before the department store opened at 10 a.m. A 42-year-old man who owns a restaurant in the city said he visited the department store to check out expensive watches. “I come here all the time, but I couldn’t because of the state of emergency,” he said. “I can finally take them in my hand to have a look.” However, in Osaka Prefecture, where the medical system is under enormous strain from the increase in COVID-19 patients, department stores kept nonessential floors and sections closed, complying with the prefectural government’s request. In Fukuoka Prefecture, commuters and students wearing masks came and went at JR Hakata Station on the morning of the prefecture’s first day under the state of emergency. A 60-year-old company employee who commutes from neighboring Saga Prefecture to Fukuoka city said, “I think the effectiveness of the state of emergency declaration has gradually diminished.” He said his company let employees work from home when the first state of emergency was issued in April 2020. But this time, employees must show up for work. Many commuters were also seen at JR Nagoya Station just past 8 a.m. on May 12. “It seems the crowds are a little smaller but not much different,” said a 50-year-old man who works at a nearby office of an IT company. A 20-year-old company employee disagreed, saying, “I don’t think the crowds are smaller.” He said his training period will end on May 12, but he is supposed to keep going to the office after that.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14346998
Centenarian beats COVID-19 with supportive doctor at her side,['By SHINYA OKUDAIRA/ Staff Writer'],"May 12, 2021 at 17:39 JST"," OTSU--Centenarian Ayako Ito is healthy and ready to celebrate her 101st birthday in June after a month-long bout with COVID-19, thanks to a positive attitude and the support of her doctor. Ito, an Otsu resident, attended a news conference at the Shiga prefectural government office on May 10 to talk about her uplifting recovery. She had to be hospitalized for a month and her condition even worsened at one point. “I trusted my doctor and depended on him completely,” Ito said, adding that it was important to have a strong will to overcome one's own difficulties. Taku Yamaguchi, 41, of Omihachiman Community Medical Center, Ito’s primary doctor during her hospitalization, also attended the news conference. According to Yamaguchi and other sources, Ito tested positive on Jan. 10. She was hospitalized on Jan. 11 along with her second daughter, who lives with her and also tested positive. Ito initially had only a cough, but from around the third day at the hospital, she developed a fever of around 38 degrees. Her peripheral oxygen saturation level was dropping, so she was hooked up to oxygen and treated with steroids. After about two weeks, she did not need to be administered oxygen. Ito went into rehab and was released from the hospital on Feb. 5. “I have no idea why or how I got infected,” she said. “I was three times more careful than others.” She said that she had great confidence in her doctor and tried to remain strong mentally, as COVID-19 poses an especially severe health risk to older patients. “Ito had been healthy before she got infected,” Yamaguchi said. “She often tried to talk and kept a positive attitude all the time.” He believes that she recovered well mainly because of self-encouragement and positivity.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14347029

Officials to call on those who fail to abide by Japan’s virus entry rules,['By TATSUYA SATO/ Staff Writer'],"May 11, 2021 at 19:01 JST"," Japan is dispatching enforcement officials for follow-up checks on people entering the country in response to entrants failing to abide by the anti-coronavirus measure to stay home for two weeks after their arrival here. The move comes after health ministry data showing that 300 entrants per day are flouting the government’s rule for them to inform authorities of their location and health on each day of the isolation period. Renho, a senior member of the main opposition Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan, raised concerns at an Upper House Budget Committee session on May 10. “Some 300 people cannot be reached per day, but we don’t know if they got sick or infected,” she said. “It could contribute to the spread of the virus.” The government will send inspectors to the homes or accommodations of entrants found to have skipped the safety protocol to confirm their whereabouts more frequently than before. As a step against the novel coronavirus, the government has requested people arriving in Japan from overseas to stay home for 14 days to restrict their movements and contact with others even if they test negative for the virus. About 20,000 to 24,000 people are asked to follow the protocol each day, according to the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare. Entrants, under the setup, must report daily to an entity commissioned by the health ministry on their location and health conditions, such as if they have a fever or a cough, using a smartphone app or email that they registered at their point of entry. Arrivals are allowed to enter Japan only after signing a written pledge to do so. But up to 300 people defy the rule per day, according to the health ministry. In response, the government’s task force on May 7 decided to take more rigorous measures to bring them in line. Inspectors will now visit the addresses that entrants registered as where they will be staying while in Japan to confirm if they are actually there. Entrants who don't answer phone calls from officials inquiring over their whereabouts will get an email from the government warning that their names could be disclosed to the public due to their negligence. Between March 26 and April 30, the health ministry only called those who failed to report. But the ministry began sending enforcement officials in May to drop in on some of those who neglected to do so and since May 7 has been sending them more frequently. Those who break their written pledge, however, won't face jail time or any other penalty. “It's difficult to impose a penalty as freedom of movement is guaranteed under the Constitution,” a health ministry official said.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14346386
"City apologizes for prioritizing company chief, wife for vaccines",['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"May 11, 2021 at 19:00 JST"," NISHIO, Aichi Prefecture--The city government here apologized on May 11 for attempting to let a prominent businessman and his wife jump the line for COVID-19 vaccinations. Nishio Vice Mayor Yoshihide Kondo said at a news conference that he tried to “do a favor” for Hirokazu Sugiura, the 70-year-old founder and chairman of pharmacy giant Sugi Holdings Co., and his wife because “the city has received assistance (from the company) in many forms.” Takaou Yanase, manager of the city government’s health and welfare department, which manages a division in charge of the vaccination program, said a secretary at Sugi Holdings, operator of the Sugi Pharmacy drugstores, had repeatedly demanded that the city give the couple priority in receiving the shots. He said the secretary made about three calls to the division’s manager-class personnel. “Before that, we received several phone calls, too,” Yanase said. “I, myself, received three or four calls. The pattern continued of us saying ‘no’ and them calling back again.” The company on May 11 also apologized to residents of the city. In a statement, the company said the secretary was worried about the chairman's wife who has a pre-existing condition. It also said the chairman doesn't want the vaccination out of concerns he would suffer from an anaphylactic reaction. According to the municipal government, the secretary first contacted city officials in mid-April and asked if Sugiura and his wife, Akiko, 67, an executive adviser for the company, could receive priority in receiving COVID-19 shots. The secretary explained that the couple, both residents of the city, are pharmacists and should be considered health care workers. A city employee rejected the request. But the Sugi secretary kept contacting the city government. “We told Sugi from the get-go that this is a special consideration,” Yanase said. “To be honest, we wanted to refuse it. But it went beyond a regular request. He also quoted the secretary as saying, “The chairman is looking forward to receiving a vaccination.” Yanase said he consulted Kondo about the matter. Kondo recalled saying, “Can you work it out?” He admitted that he instructed the health department to ensure the couple receive priority in vaccine reservations. A tentative reservation for the couple was made for May 10, the first day of the city’s vaccine rollout for elderly people. The couple were supposed to call the division to complete the reservation. Kondo, however, said the appointment was canceled on May 10 after a third party pointed out ethical problems with the arrangement. “I apologize to the city’s residents for ignoring impartiality in terms of handling the valuable vaccine,” Kondo said. He noted that the company has lent a gym for senior citizens to the city for free. He also said Sugi Pharmacy signed a comprehensive partnership agreement with the municipal government to support various projects of the city. Asked if he would resign, Kondo said, “I want to consult the mayor about my next course of action.” Kondo said he never consulted Nishio Mayor Ken Nakamura about the vaccine matter. Nakamura told the news conference: “At the moment, we want to find out the truth and implement preventive measures in full force. Reprimands will be needed afterward.” Sugi Holdings, which is headquartered in Obu in the prefecture, operates around 1,400 Sugi Pharmacy drugstores mainly in the Tokai and Kansai regions. The couple founded the company in Nishio in December 1976. They converted the company into a joint stock corporation in 1982, and Sugiura became the president. He is expected to step down as chairman, a post he has held since 2009, and become a special adviser this month.

Mie University stirs anger by asking students to behave safely,['By TETSUAKI OTAKI/ Staff Writer'],"May 11, 2021 at 18:49 JST"," TSU--Following a major COVID-19 outbreak, Mie University officials are meeting with pushback after asking students living in areas under the current state of emergency to pledge not to engage in risky behavior such as partying and traveling. Officials of the national university said the commitment form is nonbinding and seeks to secure the safety of students. Mie University was at the center of a major cluster last summer that prompted criticism from the prefectural governor. But some students and faculty on campus are criticizing the university's latest measure as a violation of human rights. “All classes were held online last year,"" said a student who lives in Mie Prefecture, which is not under a state of emergency. "" We are finally able to go to campus. But now this? I feel nothing but anger and appalled.” The form lists eight pledges including, “I will take adequate infection prevention measures,” “I will eat by myself on campus,” “I will not attend a dinner party in Mie Prefecture regardless of the number of attendees or time,” “I will refrain from traveling” and “I will not do karaoke.” Students are asked to check each box, write in their names, student ID number, the name of their department and school year, and submit it to the university. Currently, the university holds classes both online and in person on campus. In late April, the third state of emergency over the novel coronavirus pandemic was issued in Tokyo and Osaka, Hyogo and Kyoto prefectures. The university officials then started asking students who live in these areas to contact the university in advance when they attend an in-person class on campus and submit the form. Because Aichi and Fukuoka prefectures are added to the state of emergency that kicks in on May 12, the university is currently asking students who live in the two prefectures to do the same. The university said there is no punishment for those who do not comply with the request. But a professor at the university said: “It is inconceivable. What does (the university) think of students’ human rights? “The university should think about anti-virus measures and create a campus life together with students,” the professor said. A representative of the university’s department of academic affairs said, “We want the students living in the area under the state of emergency to have a high level of consciousness, in particular.” The form is “a measure to encourage students’ self-awareness and maintain their safety,” the representative said. Four COVID-19 clusters involving Mie University students have occurred so far. Infection sources include a students’ dinner party. Between Aug. 3 and 5, 2020, a total of 22 students who studied medicine and nursing science tested positive for the novel coronavirus. Of these, 11 traveled to Wakayama Prefecture in a group in late June, and one student visited a nightlife district in the Kansai region around the same time. After they returned to Mie Prefecture, infections spread among the students likely through drinking and eating together. Mie Governor Eikei Suzuki declared on Aug. 4 that the case was “the biggest infection cluster in Mie” and suggested that it worsened the already bad situation in the prefecture.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14346331

Governors urge Suga to mull nationwide state of emergency,['By NAMI HAMADA/ Staff Writer'],"May 11, 2021 at 16:15 JST"," Prefectural governors are calling on the government to consider issuing a nationwide state of emergency amid an alarming surge in infections from coronavirus variants raging across Japan. The National Governors’ Association set out a list of emergency recommendations to the central government at an online meeting on May 10, warning the infection situation has become so serious that expanding the state of emergency nationwide should be in the cards. They raised concerns that the steep rise in infections is putting the health care system at risk of collapse, and urged the government to immediately move on to stronger anti-virus measures that go beyond the existing policy framework. Ryuta Ibaragi, governor of Okayama Prefecture, which reported a record high number of new COVID-19 cases on May 8, touched on the country’s first state of emergency that was expanded in April 2020 to cover the entire nation. “We must draw on the experience of successfully curbing the spread of the virus with that decision (to expand the emergency declaration nationwide),” Ibaragi said. Shiga Governor Taizo Mikazuki echoed Ibaragi’s view, saying now is the time to issue a nationwide state of emergency, while Yamaguchi Governor Tsugumasa Muraoka called for tougher anti-virus measures across Japan. Governors of all 47 prefectures attended the meeting. “The central government declares a state of emergency, but prefectures also need to press the government to do so,” Tokushima Governor Kamon Iizumi, who is also the president of the association, told reporters after the meeting. The Suga administration’s latest emergency declaration, which covers Tokyo as well as Osaka, Kyoto and Hyogo prefectures, would have expired on May 11, but will be extended until May 31. The central government also decided to expand the scope to include Aichi and Fukuoka prefectures, starting from May 12. The government on May 7 decided to expand areas covered by pre-emergency measures, but chose not to apply them to Ibaraki, Ishikawa and Tokushima prefectures, despite requests that their jurisdictions be included. Many governors criticized that decision at the May 10 meeting. “It’s crucial to implement (pre-emergency) measures in a timely manner when they are needed,” said Fukushima Governor Masao Uchibori. “The government should swiftly approve the measures.” In its recommendations, the association also noted that in some cases, the government has decided not to grant governors’ requests to apply pre-emergency measures to their prefectures and expressed reluctance to approve the measures when discussing the matter with prefectural governments. The association asked the central government to authorize governors to be able to implement the measures in their prefectures soon after they send their requests, so that they can quickly rein in the spread of infections.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14346271
Seniors trying to reserve vaccines grow frustrated by busy signals,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"May 11, 2021 at 16:12 JST"," “Confusing” and “infuriating” have quickly joined the list of words of criticism against the government’s COVID-19 vaccine program, which has already been described as sluggish and ill-prepared. Many local governments around Japan began accepting vaccination reservations from senior citizens over the phone or internet on May 10. But the limited supply of vaccines and the “first come, first served” nature of the reservation system led to a flood of calls and overwhelmed internet connections. Many callers only got a busy signal, sometimes for days. An 83-year-old woman who lives by herself in Tachikawa, western Tokyo, does not have a computer or smartphone. She also has no one she can depend on to make a reservation on her behalf. She tried calling from May 6 when the city government began taking reservations, but she still had not succeeded as of May 10. “I may try again at the end of this month,” the woman said. “I will have to be resigned if I come down with COVID-19 in the meantime.” In nearby Higashi-Kurume also in western Tokyo, about 30 senior citizens who could not get through to the phone reservation system gathered at the city government building. A 70-year-old man in the group said he called about 30 times from 9 a.m. when the phone reservation system began but could not get connected. A city government official said that to avoid congestion, reservations were not being taken at the section where inquiries can be made. Narashino in Chiba Prefecture also began accepting phone reservations at 8:30 a.m., but all available vaccines were taken in 30 minutes. A 77-year-old man who could not get through by phone turned to the city government’s website only to find there were no more shots. “My grandchild who is taking online college classes due to the pandemic will help me the next time, so I plan to use both the internet and phone when reservations begin again,” he said. In Kawagoe, Saitama Prefecture, the limited supply of vaccines forced the city government to delay by about a month the mailing of vaccination vouchers to residents in the 65-to-74 age group. The Kawagoe municipal government began accepting reservations from those 75 and older on May 6. Although there are about 48,000 residents in that oldest age group, the city government set a limit of about 6,200 vaccination reservations for the first round. One city official in charge of the program said the delivery of vaccines was slower than expected. With more than 40,000 residents 75 and older who have not even placed a reservation, the city government decided to hold off on mailing the vouchers to the next younger age bracket. In western Japan, a programming glitch has forced the Uji city government in Kyoto Prefecture to abandon use of an internet reservation system for vaccinations. Senior citizens are now being encouraged to call, fax or mail applications for vaccine reservations. City government officials discovered a security deficiency in the internet reservation system, which was developed by an outside contractor.

Doctors plan less claustrophobic transport unit for virus patients,['By FUMI YADA/ Staff Writer'],"May 10, 2021 at 07:00 JST"," SUITA, Osaka Prefecture--A hospital here, frustrated by the poor design of isolators for transporting novel coronavirus patients, is developing its own and turning to crowdfunding to cover the costs. Doctors at Osaka University Hospital have designed a capsule-shaped isolation unit that is more spacious for patients and safer for medical personnel transporting them. The hospital has been using soft bag-type plastic isolators to prevent secondary infections from patients to doctors and nurses during transportation. But their plastic film is apt to stick to the patient’s body, making them feel claustrophobic. Medical personnel also have difficulties checking the patient when the film wrinkles. It also takes about two hours to prepare the units for use and to disinfect them afterward. Other commercially available isolators have similar problems, so the hospital decided to develop an original model designed by its doctors. “After seeing many patients up close, I was hoping that there would be a gentler way to carry them,” said paramedic Haruna Maebe, 61. “We want to reduce the burden on patients.” The crowdfunding campaign has met its goal of 10 million yen ($92,000), but it will continue until the end of May. An artist’s rendition of a patient isolation unit designed by doctors at Osaka University Hospital (Provided by Osaka University Hospital) The new model measures 200 centimeters long, 70 cm high and 60 cm wide, giving the patient enough space to sit up. It uses transparent resin and aluminum materials that ensure the isolator keeps its shape and provides better visibility for medical staff. Osaka University Hospital treats COVID-19 patients with severe symptoms at its Trauma and Acute Critical Care Center and other departments. Patients who have recovered to a stable condition are transferred in isolators to other hospitals to free up beds for incoming patients with severe symptoms. The hospital had transported 54 patients by April 6. The hospital intends to place orders for the isolators with a manufacturing company and begin using them by the end of March.

Within hours of Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga's May 7 announcement that the state of emergency would be extended until May 31 for Tokyo, Osaka, Hyogo and Kyoto prefectures and applied to Aichi and Fukuoka as well, officials in Tokyo and Osaka said they will continue their requests to local businesses to remain closed during the period. The central government had included a number of relaxations of requests, but the continued high COVID-19 case numbers in Tokyo and Osaka led officials there to stick with the stricter measures. While Suga tried to tout the effectiveness of past steps in reducing the flow of people in public spaces, he was forced to acknowledge that Tokyo, Osaka, Aichi and Fukuoka prefectures were at the most serious stage 4 in guidelines to determine the spread of infections in each jurisdiction. He cited that as his primary reason for extending the emergency. The central government said May 7 that commercial establishments with floor space of 1,000 square meters or greater could remain open until 8 p.m. However, Tokyo metropolitan government officials said they would continue to ask venues in that category to remain closed. Osaka prefectural authorities also decided May 7 to continue with the requests to large commercial establishments to remain closed. Tokyo will also continue with closure requests to movie theaters, department stores, shopping centers, video game centers and gymnasiums. It will also seek the cooperation of such businesses even if they have floor space under 1,000 square meters.

Sporting events in the capital had been held without fans in the stands, but from May 12 will be allowed to be filled to up to 50 percent capacity so long as the maximum number of fans does not exceed 5,000. Event organizers will also be asked to end the events by 9 p.m. Tokyo metropolitan high schools will continue to be asked to encourage online classes, staggered commutes to school and suspend extracurricular activities. Faced with a much tighter situation in its medical care structure, Osaka Governor Hirofumi Yoshimura said May 7 that requests to hold sporting events without fans in the stands will be continued. Yoshimura told reporters it was not appropriate to relax such steps given the high number of new COVID-19 cases that has filled hospital beds for those with serious symptoms to close to capacity. The other four prefectures to be covered by the extended state of emergency will also generally go along with the measures proposed by the central government. The Hyogo and Kyoto prefectural governments will ask large commercial establishments to close at 7 p.m. on weekdays and remain closed throughout the day on weekends.

Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga on May 7 extended the state of emergency after receiving requests from Tokyo, Osaka, Hyogo and Kyoto prefectures to keep it in place beyond the scheduled May 11 deadline. Suga also told a government task force meeting to deal with the pandemic that Aichi and Fukuoka prefectures would be covered by the state of emergency from May 12 to 31. “We will thoroughly implement measures that we feel will be highly effective as the nation returns to a normal calendar after the Golden Week of national holidays,” Suga said. He added that the effects from measures already in place could be seen in the major reduction of the flow of people in Tokyo and Osaka. But he explained that the state of emergency had to be extended because of the high numbers of new cases in the major urban centers and the strained medical care situation in Osaka and Hyogo prefectures. Businesses that serve alcohol in the six prefectures will be asked to close operations for the duration of the state of emergency. However, the previous closure request to commercial outlets with a floor space of 1,000 square meters or more will be eased. Those establishments will be allowed to stay open until 8 p.m. Measures concerning crowd capacity for sporting and other events will also be relaxed. Venues in the four prefectures covered by the state of emergency have held such events without spectators in the stands. The eased rules will allow a 50-percent capacity of the venues, but only up to 5,000 people. Governors facing still high numbers of new cases, such as in Tokyo and Osaka, will be given more flexibility on the measures, such as whether to continue asking large commercial outlets to shut operations and ban all spectators. The government task force also approved implementing pre-emergency measures to three new prefectures—Hokkaido, Gifu and Mie—from May 9 and extending such measures in the five prefectures of Kanagawa, Saitama, Chiba, Ehime and Okinawa until May 31.

Virus experts: Golden Week likely the calm before the storm,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"May 7, 2021 at 17:22 JST"," Health officials are warning against false assurances from the lower infection numbers reported during the Golden Week holidays, saying signs actually point to a more dire COVID-19 situation in the coming weeks. “New cases appear to be ebbing now but that is because fewer people got themselves tested for the virus during the Golden Week holidays,” health minister Norihisa Tamura told a meeting of an expert panel advising the ministry on the pandemic on May 6. The national daily average of new COVID-19 cases for the week between April 22 and April 28 was 4,923. The comparable figure was 4,886 per day between April 29 and May 5, when the holiday period ended. The daily average number of diagnostic tests conducted nationwide for the virus was 64,457 in April. The figure decreased by about 30 percent to 44,118 from May 1 to May 4. Tokyo reported 591 new infections on May 6, a relatively low tally for a Thursday. Sharing Tamura’s view, metropolitan health officials cautioned against taking the figure as a sign of a declining trajectory during the third state of emergency in the capital. They said the May 6 number largely reflected the fact that fewer tests were conducted because many hospitals were closed during the holidays. They also cited a delay in reports on new cases confirmed from public health centers during Golden Week. The officials said other numbers indicate that new infections will start rising again. More Tokyo residents are contacting consultation centers about fevers, a common symptom of COVID-19. And the rate of positive tests has also been increasing. The health officials said the situation now is similar to what occurred late last year before the third wave of infections hit the capital. The number of people who contacted consultation centers ranged from 756 to 1,170 a day in late March after the second state of emergency was lifted for Tokyo. But the daily number topped 2,000 in May. The daily average number of consultations over the week through May 4 was 2,079, surpassing 2,000 for the first time since the week through Dec. 31. A week later, on Jan. 7, the number of new COVID-19 cases hit a record 2,520 in Tokyo. The rate of patients who tested positive for the novel coronavirus was 9.2 percent in the week through May 4, 3 percentage points higher than a week earlier. The positive test ratio also jumped when the number of new cases surged in Tokyo late last year. N501Y, a COVID-19 variant that is believed to be 30 to 90 percent more contagious than the initial strain, is fast circulating in Tokyo. An estimated 67.9 percent of patients in Tokyo who tested positive in the most recent week were infected with the variant. The ratio was 59.6 percent in the preceding week and 32.8 percent in the week before it. “We need to thoroughly implement anti-coronavirus measures to stem the spread of the highly infectious variants,” Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike said at a meeting of health experts on May 6. Central government officials said they were worried that the variants are spreading in local regions, not just in urban centers, such as Tokyo and Osaka. Between April 28 and May 4, the number of new cases per 100,000 people was 28.44 in Hokkaido, 25.49 in Gunma Prefecture, and 33.17 in Okayama Prefecture. The numbers, each 10 cases higher than in the previous week, put those prefectures in the most serious of the nation’s four-stage levels--25 per 100,000 people--in this category.

Japan has already designated India as a country where a new coronavirus variant has been spreading, as India is reporting 400,000 daily new cases. The government is expected to decide on the tougher measures at its May 7 task force meeting. Currently, Japan requires entrants from 32 countries and regions where variant strains are spreading, including India, to be tested three times. These tests are conducted before they leave their countries, when they enter Japan, and on the third day after their arrival. If all three tests are negative, the entrants are permitted to move from accommodation facilities maintained by quarantine stations to their homes or other facilities. To ensure infected passengers coming from India are detected, the government is also considering extending the three-day waiting period at designated accommodation facilities for entrants from India to six days and requiring them to take tests again on the sixth day after arrival, according to government sources. The government is also weighing similar measures against entrants from India’s neighbor Pakistan, also designated as a country suffering from a spread of variant strain infections.

The Osaka prefectural government at a May 6 meeting formally decided to ask the central government to keep the state of emergency in place. The request was made together with the neighboring prefectures of Hyogo and Kyoto. At the meeting, Osaka Governor Hirofumi Yoshimura said an extension was unavoidable since the prefecture’s medical care situation had “reached its limit.” Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike also said on May 6 that an extension for the capital was necessary. After a meeting the same day of the metropolitan government panel overseeing the pandemic, Koike told reporters that the state of emergency could not be lifted as planned on May 11. She later consulted through a video conference with her counterparts in the three neighboring prefectures of Kanagawa, Saitama and Chiba. They reached a consensus that the state of emergency for the capital and pre-emergency measures for the three neighboring prefectures should be extended until May 31. Koike also said requests for a wide range of businesses to close during the state of emergency would continue. Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga and relevant Cabinet ministers were to meet on May 6 to discuss extending the state of emergency as well as whether to approve pre-emergency measures for Hokkaido and Fukuoka Prefecture, where infections have been rising in recent days. After a Cabinet meeting on May 5, Suga told reporters that a decision on continuing the state of emergency would be made this week. He added that he felt the effects from measures taken under the state of emergency to control the flow of people were beginning to appear. Some central government officials are concerned about the negative effects on the economy from requests to a wide range of businesses to close their doors during the state of emergency. A major point of the ministerial discussions will be whether to maintain the current measures or relax some requests. The third state of emergency began on April 25 and was initially set for a 17-day period. Experts and prefectural governors said the period was too short to control the spread of infections.

The industry associations, representing music creators, concert event hosts and others, released a statement on May 5 asking the government to withdraw its request to hold musical events only behind closed doors. The associations said that “they have been proving that live music and concert venues are not places with a high risk of infections by their efforts and results” while taking anti-virus measures based on guidelines created by the music industry. With Tokyo, Osaka and two other prefectures currently under a third state of emergency to curb the spread of COVID-19 cases, the government is asking event operators to hold concerts, theatrical plays and sports competitions without audiences in those areas. The music associations said the loss of audiences is resulting in sharp drops in income for music artists and concert event-related staff during the pandemic. “Each one of us is proud of being involved with the creation of a music culture and supporting the music, but sadly we are reaching our limits, mentally,” the statement said. “(The government) requested it without advance notice, not providing us enough time to give out information to customers.

A final decision in Hyogo will likely be made on May 7 at a meeting of the prefectural government’s task force handling the pandemic. A third state of emergency took effect April 25, but Ido said it was too early to assess the effects of the measures since 14 days had not yet passed. “I believe maintaining the measures now in place will be most effective because if they are lifted (too quickly), people might get the wrong impression that the situation is improving,” Ido said. He added that he would consult with his counterparts in Osaka and Kyoto to ensure that similar steps are in place for all three prefectures. The Hyogo prefectural government reported 331 new COVID-19 cases on May 5 and 13 deaths. The ratio of hospital beds set aside for COVID-19 patients and currently in use hovers around 79 percent.

Rescue crews performing beyond the call of duty,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"May 4, 2021 at 16:30 JST"," Ambulance crews are among the unsung heroes of the pandemic, performing their essential task of rushing patients with fevers to hospitals even though many of them have yet to receive inoculations against the novel coronavirus. In short, they are putting their lives on the line in carrying out their public duties, a situation that one health expert warned could prove catastrophic if the vaccination program does not pick up speed. “If rescue workers become infected, who is going to transport patients with fevers,” said Koji Wada, a professor of public health at the International University of Health and Welfare. “The effects would be unfathomable.” Thirty-six off-duty rescue workers gathered in the basement of the Kanda Fire Station in Tokyo’s Chiyoda Ward on May 2 were among the lucky ones. Doctors and nurses dispatched by the local medical association examined each individual and gave them a jab. “I have been constantly worried about the risk of infection because I transport several patients running fevers every day, and have been doing so for a while,” said a 37-year-old rescue medic after getting inoculated. “This will give me peace of mind.” The man explained that he always dons protective clothing and a face mask while working, but there have been instances of patients and family members not taking any precautions. “The inside of the ambulance is cramped, so I was concerned,” he added. Rescue workers are among front line health care professionals designated as the first group to receive vaccinations. An estimated 153,000 rescue workers around Japan have to be vaccinated in total, according to the Fire and Disaster Management Agency. Some local fire departments have no idea when the program will start. The 3,000 or so rescue workers for the Yokohama Fire Department also are anxiously waiting for vaccinations, but no timetable has been set. “Hospitals apparently need more time to prepare,” said an official in charge of the vaccinations. Vaccinations for the Tokyo Fire Department began in late April, but so far only a few fire stations have been covered. With many doctors, nurses and other health care professionals still waiting for jabs, inoculations of rescue workers and those at quarantine stations will likely continue at a slow pace. This, say some experts, is due to the central government's mishandling of priorities to ensure all health care workers on the front line of the crisis are vaccinated.

"Sapporo seeks help with virus, but pre-Olympic event will go on",['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"May 3, 2021 at 19:00 JST"," SAPPORO--City officials here will impose stricter measures to battle the growing COVID-19 crisis, but some of the loudest public groans are over the decision to still hold a pre-Olympic event in the Hokkaido capital. Hokkaido Governor Naomichi Suzuki and Sapporo Mayor Katsuhiro Akimoto held an emergency meeting on May 3 and agreed to ask the central government for pre-emergency “manbo” measures for the city. Sapporo confirmed a record 246 new infection cases on May 2, as well as five deaths. It was the first time the daily infection tally exceeded 200 in the city. The new infection count for May 3, a national holiday, was 88. “Manbo is the best card we can play at this moment,” Suzuki said. The formal request will be made on May 5, the day the Hokkaido-Sapporo Marathon Festival 2021, an Olympic rehearsal event, is scheduled to run. The decision by Olympic organizers not to call off the event has drawn intense criticism from residents in the city. Shuji Miura, a 55-year-old manager of a cafe located along the route, said he has complied with the Hokkaido government’s requests for eateries in Sapporo to close by 9 p.m. from April 27 to May 11. “We are doing what we can to contain the coronavirus,” he said. “But it will be completely useless if they hold the rehearsal event before we see any result.” A 47-year-old woman who runs a confectionary shop in Sapporo’s Susukino nightlife district expressed indignation toward the organizers. “I can’t come up with any good reason why they have to push it through when the infection numbers are rising this much,” she said. Under the new measures, bars and restaurants will likely be asked to close earlier, at 8 p.m. Sapporo officials have also decided to close public facilities and cancel certain events for the remainder of the Golden Week holidays to prevent the health care system from collapsing. Mayor Akimoto underscored the severity of the situation at a news conference on May 2. “Infections are rapidly spreading, and we are in a critical situation,” he said. He urged local residents, “Please refrain as much as possible from going outdoors.” To people outside of Sapporo, he said, “Please try as hard as possible not to come to Sapporo.” However, hundreds of participants are expected to enter Sapporo for the pre-Olympic event, even though the Tokyo Olympic organizing committee and local officials earlier decided to ban 2,500 citizens from participating. About 120 “elite” runners, including Japanese national team members, are billed to compete in a half-marathon, as well as 50 or so top runners in a 10-km race, both using the Olympic marathon course. Some of the runners are expected to come from overseas. Yasuo Mori, a top official of the Tokyo Organizing Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games, said the rehearsal event “is extremely important to get ready to operate the (Olympic marathons).” Organizers, including Hokkaido and Sapporo officials, will test security and anti-virus measures using the Olympic course, which starts and ends at Sapporo Odori Park. Local police will also do a necessary walk-through. They are expected to be dispatched to control crowds, enforce traffic rules and check their anti-terrorism measures. The Olympic marathon course runs through famous sightseeing spots in the city, such as the Susukino district and the campus of Hokkaido University. Organizers have insisted that a rehearsal event is necessary because it is an urban setting with heavy traffic of people and vehicles. But what if no spectators show up for the pre-Olympic event? The area surrounding Sapporo Odori Park will be closed off during the trial runs. “Anti-virus measures need to be made based on guidelines regarding spectators,” Akimoto said on April 28. “So we cannot test that part at the (rehearsal event).” He also urged residents to refrain from watching the test marathon along the route. “Please view it on TV at home,” he said. For the Olympic marathons in August, citizen volunteers will be called up to stand along the route with signs warning the public to keep a safe distance from each other to lower the risk of virus infection. However, Olympic organizers have not decided on whether any spectators will be allowed at events at the Games. Asked late last month if the Olympics should be held in the first place, Akimoto declined to answer. But he said it is “extremely important” that the organizers’ anti-virus measures, such as the number of allowed spectators, to hold the Games safely “are convincing to the public and local residents.” A 24-year-old female company employee who came to see Odori Park, where construction for the Olympics are under way, appeared unconvinced. “Fewer and fewer people are interested in the Olympics because of the pandemic,” she said. The Olympics will likely be held “when people around the world have a lot of reservations about cheering for the athletes,” she said. “I feel sorry for the athletes.” (This article was written by Kaede Sano, Ryuzo Nakano, Takuya Kado and Noboru Okada.)",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14342247

Medics fuming at request for 500 nurses for Olympics,['BY YO NOGUCHI/ Staff Writer'],"May 1, 2021 at 17:59 JST"," For medical care professionals working on the front lines of the COVID-19 pandemic, a request for 500 nurses to be on hand for the Tokyo Olympics this summer was the last straw. The request to the Japanese Nursing Association (JNA) by the Tokyo Olympic organizing committee met with a swift response. The Japan Federation of Medical Worker’s Unions (Iroren) released a statement April 30 demanding an immediate review of the request. The Aichi prefectural federation of unions for those in the medical and elderly care sectors (Aichiken Iroren) tweeted its opposition to the request on April 26 and the hashtag had received more than 240,000 tweets by April 30. Susumu Morita, Iroren secretary-general, issued a statement casting doubt on the likelihood of the health crisis being brought under control by the start of the Tokyo Olympics. “I feel strong anger at the persistence to hold the Olympics, even if that means sacrificing the lives and health of patients and nurses,” the statement said. On its own Twitter account, Aichiken Iroren tweeted, “Nurses should be dispatched to areas with insufficient nurses to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic.” Another tweet called for more measures to deal with the pandemic rather than go ahead with the Olympics. Prefectural federation officials said many medical institutions in Aichi Prefecture face a nursing shortage due to the fact that each COVID-19 patient with serious symptoms requires more intensive care from the staff. In addition, a number of nurses who contracted the novel coronavirus during the course of their work decided to quit, further exacerbating the situation. Officials said some nurses are being asked to work seven or eight night shifts a month, which is much higher than public guidelines. A number of expectant nurses have also been asked to take the night shift. “The feeling among those at the front lines is that losing even a single staff member would be disastrous,” said Ayako Yano, a prefectural federation official. “Simply presenting a 500 figure shows they have no idea what the actual situation is like. Those at the front lines are furious.” Toshiko Fukui, the JNA president, met with Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga on April 30. She later told reporters, “If they are going to go ahead with (the Tokyo Olympics), every effort should be made from now toward that goal.”",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14341415

Japan’s summer hand fans get a pandemic twist in mask mashup,['By TAKASHI NAKAJIMA/ Senior Staff Writer'],"May 1, 2021 at 08:00 JST"," HIGASHI-OSAKA, Osaka Prefecture--Could creating more user-friendly COVID-19 protection than masks that must be endlessly doffed and donned be as simple as sticking a mask on a Japanese handheld summer fan? Local plastics processing firm Kawakita here thinks so. The company is selling a mashup of a nonwoven fabric face mask and a fan it calls the Masukucchi, putting a pandemic twist on the fans that are ubiquitous during summer in Japan. The mask slips into a plastic pocket on the warped fan. That way, the mask won't come into contact with surfaces so people who use the fans can put them down on tables when eating without worrying about picking up the virus, Kawakita said. Users can also hang the fans around their necks, it added. By holding the fans over their mouths, users can block potentially infectious droplets of saliva from escaping and spreading the virus, the company said. You can quickly stick a fan in front of your mouth, Kawakita said, helping reduce the risk of novel coronavirus infection through droplets of stray saliva. The company also touts the fan over see-through plastic face shields, saying that they can steam up, but that's not an issue with the Masukucchi. Though the surgical mask on the fan must sometimes be replaced, the fan can be washed and used repeatedly. Kawakita started selling them online for 550 yen ($5.05) after tax on April 15. IDEA CAME FROM VISITOR The company got the idea to make the fans from a visitor to their office in December last year. The man in his 60s, who said he was an adviser for an insurance company, showed them a trial product, said Ichiro Kawakita, 54, Kawakita's third-generation president. The man from Tsu in Mie Prefecture said he wanted to “help restaurants struggling with plummeting sales due to the coronavirus crisis” and asked Kawakita to help him put them in production. Kawakita's president, who had heard his favorite eatery was in the same boat, readily accepted. Though the man's prototype was far from ready to go, Kawakita felt he had to hurry with development given the urgent situation for restaurants and contacted other business operators around Higashi-Osaka for help. The handle of a normal handheld fan was adopted and transparent plastic was selected to make the fan's body. Development finished in February this year. “The experience made me reconfirm that manufacturing is a great job to bring ideas into shape,” Kawakita said. The man then started selling the Masukucchi to corporations and applied for a patent. Kawakita initially planned to simply produce the item “behind the scenes,” but later decided to sell it online to eateries and individual customers.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14330519

Tokyoites under emergency still searching for places to drink,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"April 30, 2021 at 17:24 JST"," Bars and restaurants outside of Tokyo have stopped serving alcohol to prevent imbibers in the capital from fleeing their state of emergency, crossing borders to grab some drinks, and potentially spreading the novel coronavirus. But not all businesses have followed suit. And many are receiving free advertising about the availability of alcohol in those establishments. Under the COVID-19 state of emergency in Tokyo, drinking places have halted sales of booze to cut down on foot traffic, particularly in entertainment districts, and halt the latest surge in novel coronavirus infections. The neighboring prefectures of Kanagawa, Saitama and Chiba are only covered by pre-emergency measures, and they had been asking bars and restaurants to close early. But from April 28, a total of 36 municipalities in the three prefectures asked businesses to also refrain from serving alcohol in a bid to prevent throngs of Tokyoites from venturing across prefectural borders in search of a drink. After the state of emergency took effect in the capital on April 25, one popular destination for drinkers was the Kanagawa Prefecture city of Kawasaki, located across the Tamagawa river from Tokyo’s Ota Ward. But on the evening of April 28, many bars and restaurants near JR Kawasaki Station had posted signs saying alcohol was not being served. Others have closed down for the duration of the pre-emergency measures. The manager of one restaurant that complied with the prefectural government request to stop serving alcohol and close at 8 p.m. pointed to another establishment across the road. The “izakaya” Japanese-style pub not only was still open, but it was also serving alcohol. Six groups were in that izakaya, and customers in five of the groups were not wearing face masks. The restaurant manager said sales on April 28 were only a third of the take the previous day. “Customers are clearly going to places that serve alcohol,” the manager said. A man in his 40s who drank at the izakaya with two colleagues said he worked near JR Kamata Station in Ota Ward and he could not think of a bar or restaurant near that station where he could get a drink. “Kawasaki is a large place, so I thought there had to be a place that served alcohol,” he said, adding that he was aware Kanagawa Prefecture was covered by pre-emergency measures. He and his colleagues took the train for one stop to quench their thirsts. “We wore face masks when we were talking, and I drank with people I work with every day,” the man said. “People who want to drink will do so after finding an open bar.” A 26-year-old company employee was taking photos with his smartphone of izakaya open for business near Kawasaki Station. “I was informing friends living in Tokyo what places were still open at this time of night,” the man said. While he had avoided drinking parties last year, he said he has attended about two such sessions every month this year. “We refrained for over a year, so I believe from now it is all about self-responsibility,” he said. UNITY IN KAWAGUCHI Local government requests are being followed in Kawaguchi in Saitama Prefecture. The city is located across the Arakawa river from Tokyo’s Akabane, long known for its many bars where customers could get a buzz for 1,000 yen ($9). One “yakitori” grilled chicken place in Kawaguchi that has been in business for more than three decades had about 30 customers on April 27. The following night, after the no-booze rule took effect, only six customers were seated at the counter. And they were drinking non-alcoholic beer or oolong tea with their chicken. Other establishments in the area posted signs saying they were either closing or not serving alcohol from April 28. The 64-year-old owner of the yakitori restaurant said: “Many of the businesses here have a long history, so there is unity. We obey the rules because we are aware others are watching.” The 44-year-old owner of a Kawaguchi izakaya that opened in May 2020 had to tell five groups of young potential customers that his place was not serving alcohol. After the second state of emergency for Saitama Prefecture was lifted, the izakaya’s 40 or so seats were filled every day between late March and early April. On April 26 and 27, when the izakaya closed its doors at 8 p.m., about 30 customers showed up each day, with many saying it might be their last chance to drink there. On April 28, the izakaya had only two customers. The owner said: “Kawaguchi may not have an image as ‘a place to go for drinks.’ I felt ‘not again’ just after sales began picking up. I had hoped for more customers during the Golden Week of national holidays, but this puts me in a bind.” (This article was written by Keita Yamaguchi and Yusuke Nagano.)",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14340690
Olympic torch relay staff part of remote island’s 1st virus cluster,['By SHINICHI SENZAKI/ Staff Writer'],"April 30, 2021 at 17:14 JST"," KAGOSHIMA--Amami city officials who controlled traffic at the recent Tokyo Olympic torch relay on Amami-Oshima have tested positive for COVID-19 and become part of the first infection cluster on the remote island. The Kagoshima prefectural government on April 29 confirmed that four men and five women who went to an eatery that provides entertainment in the city of Amami tested positive for the novel coronavirus. Two of the four are employees, one in his 20s and the other in his 30s, who work at the city hall’s main building, the city government said. The two helped control traffic for about two hours starting from 11 a.m. on April 27 as the torch relay passed through the city. They took anti-virus measures and wore a mask, the city said. The two have developed a fever and a sore throat, but both have mild symptoms, the city said. Their infections were confirmed on April 28 and 29. Their workspace and communal areas in the city government building were sanitized. Their daily duties do not involve over-the-counter contact with the public, the city said. Amami Mayor Tsuyoshi Asayama released a statement apologizing to the residents. The city of Amami, which has a population of about 42,000 residents, is on Amami-Oshima island, about 380 kilometers south of Kagoshima, the prefectural capital.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14340682
"Tokyo reports 698 new virus cases, down 61 from a week ago",['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"April 30, 2021 at 16:58 JST"," Tokyo confirmed 698 new COVID-19 cases on April 30, down 61 from the 759 cases reported a week ago, according to metropolitan government officials. It marks the first time since March 31 that the capital’s daily count dipped below the previous week’s figure. The latest tally brought the daily average for the week through April 30 in the capital to 773.4 cases, or 110.9 percent of the preceding week’s figure. Of the 698 cases, 218 patients are in their 20s, followed by 130 in their 40s and 110 in their 30s. There are 52 patients aged 65 or older.

Pandemic hitting women harder due to lack of gender equality,['By SAWA OKABAYASHI/ Staff Writer'],"April 30, 2021 at 15:15 JST"," From losing their jobs and struggling to find work to becoming victims of domestic violence and even taking their own lives, women are disproportionately bearing the brunt of the novel coronavirus pandemic, research shows. According to a Cabinet Office report released on April 28, the average number of female non-regular workers in 2020 dropped by 500,000 from the previous year. The average number of male non-regular workers in 2020, though, was only 260,000 less than the year before. The Cabinet Office had set up a research group to study how women are being affected by the pandemic and what challenges they face. The report presents eye-popping statistics that reveal how existing societal problems that unequally affect women have become much more severe amid the ongoing health crisis. Sawako Shirahase, a sociology professor at the University of Tokyo who chaired the research group, said at a news conference that the results reflect how serious the gender inequality gap is in Japan. She urged the government to establish new policies that adopt gender perspectives. “It is not that the measures are needed because of the pandemic,” she said. “There is no way (for women) to survive if the gap widens even further.” Her group interviewed civil support organizations and analyzed statistical data to examine the issue across four categories: employment and the economy, violence against women, health, and unpaid work such as housework and raising children. The report said the nearly two-fold gap between men and women emerged in the non-regular workers' job loss figures because the restaurant, hospitality and service industries--all of which have a high ratio of female workers--are being hit particularly hard in the pandemic. The report's analysis of central government data shows women with children who are elementary school age or younger had struggled harder to find work than other women when schools were shut down due to the pandemic around April 2020. The unemployment rate for single mothers significantly rose in the period from July to September last year, the group also found. It said the underlying reason is that Japan’s social structure lacks gender equality. The group said it is necessary to change the perception that “men are the breadwinners” and “what women earn is an assist to household finances.” The country’s social security and tax systems were designed based on that idea, the group said. It cited a study that showed female non-regular workers in dual-income households earn 20 percent of the household income while female regular workers earn 40 percent. The group said it is vital for women to be financially independent amid grim statistics on suicide and abuse. The number of men who committed suicide in 2020 was about 14,000, which was 23 fewer than the previous year. By comparison, 7,000 women killed themselves in 2020, 935 more than the previous year. The number of housewives, pensioners and high school students who committed suicide increased, the group said. The report mentioned instances where women have hesitated to escape from their partners in domestic abuse cases because they rely on the abusers’ income. The number of consultations on domestic violence from April 2020 to February this year was more than 170,000, 1.5 times more than the same time the previous year. The number of consultations a support center for victims of sexual crime and sexual violence received between April and September of 2020 increased 1.2 times from the previous year.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14340607

"New infections in Tokyo top 1,000 for first time since Jan. 28",['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"April 29, 2021 at 17:49 JST"," New COVID-19 cases in Tokyo exceeded 1,000 for the first time in about three months on April 29, fueling fears a more contagious variant has become the dominant strain in the capital. Metropolitan government officials confirmed 1,027 new cases, bringing the daily average for the week until April 29 to 782.1, a 14.3 percent increase over the average for the previous week. New COVID-19 cases began surging in Tokyo from the end of last year during the third wave of infections. The daily figure hit a record high 2,520 on Jan. 7, followed by two days each with more than 2,000 new infections. The number of cases then began declining, and on Jan. 28, 1,065 cases were reported, the last time the capital confirmed more than 1,000 new infections. The daily figures dropped to levels between 100 and 400 by late February. However, the flow of pedestrian traffic in Tokyo began picking up again, likely because people became weary of anti-virus measures, such as refraining from outings or meals with friends and colleagues. That led to another steady increase in cases from about March 10. On April 7, Tokyo reported 555 new cases, surpassing 500 for the first time since Feb. 6. The recent surge in Tokyo has been fueled by the N501Y variant strain that had earlier spread rapidly in the Kansai region of western Japan. According to tests conducted by the Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Public Health, 59.6 percent of patients in the capital tested until April 25 were infected with the N501Y strain. The figure for the previous week was 32.8 percent and 37.8 percent two weeks earlier, showing that variant strain is quickly becoming the main one in Tokyo. The variant is said to have a much higher effective reproduction number, which indicates the average number of people a single COVID-19 patient will infect. The N501Y strain had a 1.43-fold to 1.9-fold higher figure than the original strain. The mutant strain is also more likely to cause serious symptoms among infected young people. Health experts urged caution because all age brackets were at risk. Infection clusters of the variant strain have been found at Tokyo day care centers and elementary schools, in addition to hospitals and facilities for senior citizens.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14340187
Large infection risk found in 30% of asymptomatic virus patients,['By YUMI NAKAYAMA/ Staff Writer'],"April 29, 2021 at 16:12 JST"," Potentially big spreaders of the novel coronavirus can be the people least suspected of carrying the contagion, a recent study showed. In a “social testing” project that started in October 2020, Tokyo’s Setagaya Ward office tested residents and workers at care facilities and related businesses for elderly and disabled people. All 21,710 people tested as of April 27 showed no signs of COVID-19 symptoms, but 117 were in fact infected with the novel coronavirus. Samples are analyzed under an amplification process to detect the virus. Larger quantities of the virus, which increase the risk of infecting others, require less amplification for detection. Hiroshi Nishihara, a professor at Keio University Hospital Clinical and Translational Research Center, analyzed the data under commission from the ward office. He said he focused on the Ct value, which indicates how many times amplification was repeated to confirm the presence of the virus. Nishihara said the amplification value was small in 27 of 78 positive cases detected over a four-month period. That means 30 percent of the asymptomatic patients carried large quantities of the virus and a greater danger of infecting others. “It is urgent to find people with certainty who are at high risk of spreading the infection,” Nishihara said. The ward mayor, Nobuto Hosaka, released the data from the study on April 28. “It is important to know not only the result—positive or negative—but also the strength of infection,” Hosaka said. “The time has come to focus on the Ct value and think about effective measures.” The ward office also started “pool testing” project on April 19, in which five specimens are tested together, and the ones with a “positive” result are then individually tested. The project is intended to save time, reagent volume and costs, the ward said. “The biggest infection risk is via saliva when people talk and eat without wearing a mask,” Nishihara said. “A pool polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test that uses saliva is effective.” The ward office plans to continue its study until September. Based on the results, the ward office plans to submit a proposal to the central government on ways to contain the virus while maintaining socio-economic activities.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14340142

IOC president says he understands Tokyo’s COVID-19 emergency move,['REUTERS'],"April 28, 2021 at 19:40 JST"," Thomas Bach, head of the International Olympic Committee (IOC), said on Wednesday he fully understood the decision to declare a state of emergency in Tokyo to fight the coronavirus pandemic, and was committed to holding a safe, successful Games. Bach was speaking at the start of a meeting with Tokyo 2020 organisers to finalise the second edition of the ""playbooks"" of rules for the Summer Games, with less than three months to go and Japan battling a surge of coronavirus cases. Parts of Japan including the capital were put under another state of emergency at the weekend, and most of the Japanese public think the Games, postponed from 2020 because of the pandemic, should be cancelled or postponed again. The emergency, which is due to last until May 11, requires restaurants and bars serving alcohol to close along with large stores, cinemas and other commercial facilities, asks firms to let staff work from home, and excludes spectators from big sports events. Speaking by video link, Bach told organisers, including Tokyo 2020 President Seiko Hashimoto, that he understood the move, and that compliance with the playbooks, which lay out a number of anti-infection measures, would be strictly enforced. ""The IOC is fully committed to the successful and safe delivery of the Olympic and Paralympic Games,"" he said. An earlier edition of the rules, which came out in February, banned singing and chanting during events and mandated that event participants wear masks at all times except when sleeping, eating or outdoors. Spectators from overseas have already been excluded, but more than 10,000 athletes, coaches and their entourages are expected in July. Athletes and coaches will undergo virus testing on a daily basis, according to media reports. Kyodo news agency said officials who come into close contact with athletes will also need to be tested every day. A decision on the number of domestic spectators allowed into venues may not come until June. Though Japan has not suffered as badly from COVID-19 as many other countries, the infection rate has risen back to levels not seen since January, and more and more are from variant strains.

Not being able to serve alcohol is sobering blow to Shinbashi area,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"April 27, 2021 at 18:46 JST"," Bars and restaurants in Tokyo’s Shinbashi district, famed as a drinking spot for Japanese businessmen, are struggling to draw patrons after being asked not to serve alcohol under the COVID-19 state of emergency. Shortly past 6 p.m. on April 26, the first weekday since Japan’s third state of emergency was issued for the capital as well as Osaka, Hyogo and Kyoto prefectures, most pedestrians in suits in the area appeared to be headed to JR Shinbashi Station, rather than stopping at a bar. “The crowds are only around half the level of last week,” said a restaurant employee in her 20s with a sigh, as she was trying to convince customers passing by on the street to come in. “And they're all salarymen going home.” Establishments that serve alcohol are being asked to close in areas covered by the emergency declaration. Nearly half the bars and restaurants around Shinbashi Station were operating on April 26 with signs reading, “We’re open without serving alcohol.” But many other establishments put up notices to inform customers that they will remain closed until May 11, when the current state of emergency is due to end. The area, known as a nightlife heaven for businessmen, was darker than usual as many outlets turned off the lights. Among establishments operating that day, one eatery offering grilled entrails taped over the alcoholic drinks on its menu out front. Still, dozens of people dropped by. But they left after the manager of the restaurant told them that it wasn't serving alcohol. Before the emergency declaration, 80 percent of the eatery's seats were full by late afternoon, but they were empty on the evening of April 26. “The ‘ban on alcohol’ has dealt the heaviest blow to our operations,” said its manager, in his 30s, who has complied with authorities’ requests to close early to contain the pandemic. Meanwhile, some businessmen were seen drinking canned “chuhai,” shochu-based alcoholic beverages, in the square in front of the station. A man in his 50s and another in his 60s said they would drink canned chuhai for about half an hour on the streets or at a park after their day’s work to let off steam. They said the drinking sessions had been their favorite pastime since before the pandemic started. But they gave up drinking openly in public after learning about news reports calling on people to refrain from drinking in the streets. Emptying canned chuhai wrapped in cooler covers, the men lamented the recent tendency of people to bash others for their behavior. The Asahi Shimbun used smartphone location data by Softbank Group Corp. affiliate Agoop Corp. to analyze foot traffic around Shinbashi Station between 3 p.m. and 4 p.m. on the first Sundays after the first, second and third states of emergency were issued. The results showed pedestrian traffic on April 25 was about 2.3 times greater than on April 12, 2020, when the first emergency declaration was in place, and roughly 1.1 times the level on Jan. 10, when the second state of emergency was in effect.
