Sejakfi Penti sokonglah Bandai- soakingkin JK-4 Shayal surat spicy musuhpenin musuhun but China is hard press to condemn Russia's invasion or pressure Russia to stop fighting it shares a very long land border with Russia and it has to consider its own substantial relations with Russia so the war has made it difficult for China to improve relations with Europe even though I think both sides would like to do so It has also complicated China's already very troubled ties with the United States which brings me to the second big issue which is US-China relations When I visited China last month, this was on everyone's minds Likewise in all my recent meetings with US visitors between the US and China there is deep mutual suspicion and fundamental mistrust In America, the Democrats and Republicans disagree with each other on almost everything but they are united on one issue, China The prevailing view in America is that their efforts to work out a cooperative relationship with China have failed and China's growing strength and assertiveness is becoming a grave threat to US interests and values and therefore the US must go for extreme competition and maintain as large a lead as possible in their words over China in foundational technologies such as semiconductor chips, quantum technology, artificial intelligence, biotechnology and green technologies all the things that count and it is not just the US government, negative perceptions are prevalent amongst the population too The latest Pew survey found that over 80% of adults in the US have an unfavorable view of China and nearly 40% fall in ten, would describe China as an enemy of the US rather than as a competitor or partner Surveys in China similarly show that Chinese public perception of the US has deteriorated More consequently, China's leaders have become convinced that the US is seeking to contain and circle and suppress China in the words of Presidency Jinping They believe that Washington wants to hold back China's growth and weaken the Communist Party of China's hold on power They say the East is rising and the West is declining and they think the time has come for China to take its rightful place in the world They consider issues like Hong Kong, Xinjiang and Tibet to be China's domestic matters vitally affecting its security and integrity on which they see no room for discussion or compromise But the most dangerous flashpoint of all is Taiwan Singapore is good friends with China and we are also old friends of Taiwan Singapore rigorously upholds our one China policy and continues to support the peaceful development of cross-states relations China considers Taiwan as the most important issue and the one China principle to be the redest of its red lines But in the West, an alternative narrative is gaining currency That the problem in cross-states relations is a broader ideological issue of democracy versus autocracy This is even though most countries, including most Western countries, have officially adopted one China policies This difference of views is very worrying Right now, tensions over Chaiwan are high All sides continue to make moves, responding to one another After Dr Tsai Ing-wen met US House Speaker Kevin McCarthy during her recent stop over in the US China launched three days of extensive military exercises all around Taiwan A CCTV report described them as comprehensive and precise simulated attacks On the key targets in the island and surrounding waters The risks of a miscalculation or mishab are growing US-China relations will not improve anytime soon Even if the two powers avoid a direct conflict which thankfully, I believe, neither side wishes to see Enduring enmity and bad relations between them will be very costly for both and will mean big trouble for the rest of the world It is a very worrying outlook but we still hope that relations between US and China do not get worse And that both sides can keep lines of communications open And with time, gradually repair their relationship on the basis of mutual trust and respect The third big issue is that the global multilateral trading system is under siege This has very serious implications especially for small open economies For Singapore, a stable, well-functioning international trading system is vitally important We cannot survive other than as an open economy We rely on the free flow of trade and investments across the world And a common set of rules that applies to all countries no matter their size This has helped us greatly to compete against bigger countries attracting investments from around the world and to grow For the last few decades there was a broad international consensus supporting globalization Countries were lowering tariff and non-tariff barriers, harmonising rules, seeking win-win economic cooperation APEC economies talked about their vision of an FTAAP, a free trade area of the Asia Pacific Even when countries clash on political or security issues, they still continue to do business with each other And from time to time countries might violate the rules set by the World Trade Organization, the WTO But even then the exceptions had to be justified and defended Now things have changed All over the world countries are prioritising domestic and national security considerations Countries no longer talk about trade being win-win Too often when countries quarrel their bilateral trade becomes embroiled in these disputes They impose restrictions on imports or exports It depends if you need my imports more than me I restrict my exports If it's the opposite, you will restrict your imports So sometimes it's high-tech items like semiconductor chips or sophisticated machinery Sometimes it's agricultural products like bananas or barley or wine They seek to inflict maximum political pain while blindly denying any harm It's a vicious cycle Countries trust each other less and less to play by the rules Therefore they are increasingly going their own way An on-shorting or friend-shorting supply chains And this then triggers a tit for tat response from the other side We are once again heading towards a world where protectionism is a default And trade rules are secondary Like what happened in the period between the first and second world wars The economic cost to the world will be very high The IMF recently estimated that fragmentation of the global economy could in the long run reduce global GDP by 7% Cumulatively 7% is a very high figure But I think it is a conservative estimate Because the reality is probably worse 7% is the effect on goods and services not traded But de-globalization will also impact on the exchange of ideas and innovation Technology, development and diffusion As well as capital flows and cross-border financing All of which add to growth, prosperity and human well-being And these are all vital for economic growth, especially for an open economy like ours So a deep decoupling of the world economy would undo what has taken country's decades to collectively achieve What can we do? The current global situation, both strategic and economic, is grave and we have experienced for a very long time Singapore has survived difficult periods before, the Cold War between the US and Soviet Union And closer to home the proxy fights in Vietnam and Cambodia The Asian financial crisis and the global financial crisis Public health crisis like SARS and most recently COVID-19 But what we have now is unprecedented A hot war in Europe, deepening hostility between two superpowers Which are closely interlinked with each other And protectionism undermining the foundations of the multilateral trading system These three simultaneous crisis will set and train a whole series of changes and shocks That will severely disrupt the world, our region And surely Singapore In such a troubled environment, what can we do? First and foremost, we must remain one united people We have come through repeated challenges over the last six decades Because we worked together, took adversity in our stride and kept faith with one another We painstakingly created a harmonious, multiracial and multiriligious society We avoided the schisms and factions that have troubled other societies In recent years, we have tackled sensitive issues that could easily have caused deep rifts among our people Two years ago, we allowed Muslim nurses to wear the dudong with their uniforms Last year, we repealed Section 377A of the Penal Code, while safeguarding the institution of marriage We handled these issues firmly and fairly In a way that maintained mutual trust and understanding between different communities And kept ourselves together You may think nothing happens, so what to say first about? We should have just done it, and a long time ago But look at what has happened elsewhere, opposing groups getting worked up, mobilising their followers Pitting citizens against each other and dividing society This could easily have happened here too, and it can still happen to us Many foreigners, especially our critics in the West, don't understand this about us In Singapore, when faced with a divisive issue, our approach has always been to find a middle way, bridge the differences, strike compromises and heal divisions Not grand posturing, not playing cultural or identity politics, not dividing and polarising people Our instinct always is to keep Singaporeans together We have to keep on thinking and acting like this Please do not take our harmony for granted, it's a very precious thing and very fragile We must continuously work on it and build up our social cohesion and national strength The troubled external environment will create new stresses and strains on our society High inflation because of the Ukraine war will cause difficulties for many households, especially lower and middle income families Tensions between China and the US will expose our population to emotional polls, commercial pressures And influence campaigns from one side or the other to take their point of view and support their cause The fracturing of the global trading system will mean slower, more uncertain growth and greater disruption to industries and jobs to businesses and workers We must not allow these pressures to divide Singaporeans along fault lines in our society Whether old or new, like the halves versus the half-notch, the liberals versus the conservatives, the locals versus the foreigners, new versus old citizens And above all differences between races and religions In this new troubled world, it is all the more important for us to close ranks Divided, we stand no chance We must do our best to see eye to eye on the fundamentals and try to appreciate each other's perspectives Even if we cannot always agree We must not shy away from hard choices but deal squarely with difficult issues based on facts and sound analysis We must nurture the deep and precious trust that we have between the government and the people and also among Singaporeans And work hand in hand towards a shared vision of our future And this is what Singapore is about Bringing Singaporeans together to refresh our social compact and come up with a collective roadmap for our way forward Members have heard DPM Lawrence Wong and other 4G ministers outline the forward Singapore agenda earlier We will make sure meritocracy works for all We will leave no one behind as Singapore progresses We will enhance safety nets against the uncertainties of life And we will fashion a common understanding and purpose that binds us together All this is absolutely essential and the government will fully back this agenda with policies, programmes and resources It is an ambitious agenda that will not be easy to realise even in good times In these turbulent times, it is all the more important that we get it done and get it right So that we can stay united as one people, one Singapore But just being united will not be enough It is equally important that we have the goal-getting spirit of self-reliance and enterprise to create prosperity for our nation and achieve the best we can in a very troubled world This has always been our attitude Long ago in 1968, Singapore was heading into a major storm The British forces were here, they contributed about one fifth of the economy and they were soon to withdraw from Singapore Our unemployment was already 10% dangerously high We faced the prospect of mass unemployment and economic collapse Mr S. Rajaratnam had just become Minister of Labour and was girding Singaporeans for tough measures and hard times ahead Speaking in Parliament at the end of the debate on the President's address, not this debate but that debate in 1968, he said In a quote, Industrial development requires at all times a sustained effort, a willingness to mobilize savings, a readiness to take risks, a propensity for innovation, a passionate vision of the future A willingness to make the painful adjustments required by modernisation And most important of all, a readiness on the part of the people as a whole to postpone immediate rewards for greater gains in the future If we are not prepared to pay this price, he said, then there will be little or no economic development Rajaratnam went on to say, We in Parliament can, if we like, fool the people into believing that we can bring them prosperity without the tears and effort But he warned that if we did that, then we would go the way of many independent countries into bankruptcy and despair Only in Singapore, we don't have an escape hatch, the hinterland that many other countries have This mindset of grit and self-reliance was crucial Because Singaporeans heated Rajarat's words and set our hearts and souls to nation-building, we survived the withdrawal of the British forces, we overcame many more subsequent crises and we created today's Singapore Now, once again, we are headed into difficult times Rajarat's rallying call, more than 50 years ago, remains just as valid and critical for us today I can hardly improve on the words that the draughtor of our national pledge used Again, we need a sustained effort, a willingness to mobilize savings, a readiness to take risks, a propensity for innovation, a passionate vision of the future, a willingness to make the painful adjustments required by modernisation And most important of all, a readiness on the part of the people as a whole to postpone immediate rewards for greater gains in the future This formula has long worked for us and it will continue to do so There is good reason to be confident that Singaporeans have not gone soft and forgotten these fundamentals Last June, I visited Rwanda for the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting Africa is not the first place that comes to mind when Singaporeans think about venturing overseas But there I met several young Singaporeans living and working in Rwanda One was running a poultry farm, supplying chicken to restaurants in Kigali, Rwanda's capital Another was working with startups to raise financing A third had started a distillery, brewing premium spirits, not just any hot, but premium spirits I asked him what it was, he said his special rum And he is hoping to make his rum brands as famous as single malt Scottish visquis And there were a few more, including some women who dared to take the path less travelled and strike out on their own in these less familiar lands Last week, at the reception after the opening of Parliament, I met a student from NUS He had spent a year in Silicon Valley on the NUS overseas colleges programme and he founded Exilirating He picked up new skills, was inspired by the culture of innovation and the entrepreneurial spirit of the people he met I asked about his plans after graduation and he told me he intends to start his own business Together with the few of his NOC Silicon Valley classmates, the NUS overseas colleges, Silicon Valley classmates He does not know if his business will succeed but he is prepared to take that leap of faith to start a business of his own And in my daily work, interacting with ministers and their staffs, I come across young officers who are passionate about their work I feel a sense of mission serving the nation and are keen to improve the lives of Singaporeans through their ideas and efforts Many young Singaporeans think and act the same way Growing up in Singapore, they have benefited from a good education system, opportunities, exposure, stimulation They have made the most of all this, they know that nobody knows them a living They will work hard and blaze their own path forward, Raja would have been proud and delighted But we are not just asking Singaporeans to work harder as individuals We have a strategy to make a living for our nation as a global city and an international hub It will be tough because globalization is going the wrong way Countries with larger populations and bigger domestic markets are turning inwards It will cost them but maybe they can afford to do so But Singapore cannot turn inwards, we are a small island state, a little red dot, and that is our reality Our survival depends on our being able to do business with the world to deliver value to others So our strategy must be to double down on staying open and connected to the world And continue making ourselves useful as a global city and international hub We must work hard to form good relations with other countries, big and small, and find ways to work with them Even with wars, tensions and protectionism in the world, countries still need to trade There will still be opportunities and therefore we can still make a living Hence, Changi can still be one of the busiest and best airports in the world Our Singapore port can still be a highly efficient and reliable, transshipment hub Connected to other ports all over the world We can still be a financial centre, financing trade flows and infrastructure investments in the region and beyond Our city can still be a magnet for talent and enterprise, a centre for technology and innovation, and a base for trusted services and advanced manufacturing All this we can still be, we just have to work harder and smarter than before In the world of troubles, not every country will prosper but Singapore will not perish Of course, we must make the right moves to continue thriving Staying open and connected means exposing ourselves to competition from the world We must be able to do things more competently and efficiently than our competitors to maintain our age And this means continually upgrading existing capabilities and building new ones Transforming and restructuring our economy to stay abreast of technologies and industries Take, for example, artificial intelligence, a rapidly developing field You've all heard of chat GPT and maybe even have tried it out It didn't write this speech for me yet, though it probably can already summarise it quite well But chat GPT is just one AI application out of many AI will affect jobs across all sectors, including white collar jobs Some will be enhanced, others will be eliminated At the same time, AI technology will create immense opportunities to improve productivity across the board To respond to AI and many more technologies to come, our businesses will need to adapt and transform to develop new wakers ways of operating and explore new markets Our workers need to upskill and re-skill to do their new jobs which replace the old ones We need to complement our own talent with skilled professionals from all over the world We need to have the expertise and experience to help us make this transformation And we have to integrate these foreigners into our world places and communities so that they fit well into our society It will be challenging We will feel tensions, we will experience disruptions, we will have to manage the problems and deal with the trade-offs thoughtfully and sensibly But we have some things going for us Most importantly, we stand up, compared to competitors The economic intelligence unit, the EIU, recently ranked the business environment of countries for the next five years Singapore came in top amongst 82 countries that the EIU looked at from across the world Singapore has ranked top now for 15 years in a row Businesses, investors, talented individuals in the region and beyond show great interest in Singapore They want to come here to bring in their talent, capitals and investments We welcome them, we must welcome them, how can there be any doubt? Take pharmaceuticals for example After Covid, every country wants to be able to make its own vaccines But not every country can We have a strong base of biomedical activities from R&D to manufacturing and the prerequisites for building vaccine plants EDB has secured several vaccine projects Everyone has heard of Pfizer-BioNTech, many of us have taken their Covid vaccine But you may not know that Pfizer and BioNTech are two companies And that both separately are making major investments in Singapore to produce drugs and vaccines for the global market Other farmers and other industries are keen on Singapore too They value the Singapore brand, they have a good view of Singapore And that is how we can continue to create good jobs for Singaporeans Which brings me to my next point We must uphold Singapore's good reputation and standing in the world When I meet foreign leaders and business people, whether here or on my trips abroad, many express their admiration for Singapore They are not just being polite, they are effusive They talk about having read Mr Lee Kuan Yus books They tell me how they wish their countries could become like Singapore Many Singaporeans take this good reputation for granted They are glad to carry out red passport Overseas, they are proud to identify themselves as Singaporeans And not be mistaken as someone else But they do not realise how important this high standing we enjoy is to us Know how astonishing it is for a small island state with no natural resources to enjoy this standing What do I mean? Based on our land size, Singapore is barely visible on the world map By country population, we are hardly worth mentioning China and India are each 250 times our population US and Indonesia, more than 40 times Malaysia is 5 times bigger than us Even compared with other major cities by population size, we are not in the top 15 in the world If we did not stand out from the rest, there would be no particular reason why other countries and investors should pay much attention to this little island And no particular reason why Singaporeans should enjoy a quality of life and a standard of living That we can be proud of than it is among the highest in the world And yet they do and we do Why? It is because of the strong international reputation that Singapore has built up over the years People know that the Singapore system works And the Covid-19 has made our track records stand out even more People know our people are of high quality Our workers are hardworking, skilled and reliable Our professionals are competent, honest and trustworthy People know that we honour our commitments We act based on principles which we uphold consistently Our leaders speak with a mandate and authority to deliver on what they say Because they enjoy the support and confidence of the people Our policies do not chop and change or get reversed from one election to another Thus when Russia invaded Ukraine, we took a clear principle stand To oppose this flagrant violation of the UN Charter We did the same decades ago when the US invaded Grenada And Vietnam invaded Cambodia Any part of the world, any power, any decade, same answer from Singapore Because that's where our enduring interests lie And people can depend on that People know that we make useful contributions on global issues For example, the Director General of the World Intellectual Property Organization, WIPO, is a UN outfit Now is a Singaporean Mr Darwin thing Senior Mr Thaman is co-chairing the Global Commission on Water Governance Whose first report was discussed at the UN Water Conference held in New York last month Our ambassador for oceans and law of the sea issues, Reiner Lee, presided over negotiations under UNCLOS On marine biodiversity of areas beyond national jurisdiction They call it BBNJ Biodiversity of areas beyond national jurisdiction That means on the high seas belonging to nobody And the negotiations have been going on for many years Reiner was president of the negotiations for the last four years Five years and last month, she successfully brought all the parties together to conclude a new international agreement The BBNJ agreement, or high seas treaty, which is expected to be adopted later this year And many other Singaporeans working in different fields all over the world Also distinguishing themselves and enhancing our international reputation Because of all these and more confidence and trust in the Singapore brand has grown This is a precious asset in an uncertain world So I ask all Singaporeans, through you Mr Speaker, to uphold our country's reputation Especially when you are overseas Make full use of the Singapore brand, but remember, never salir Build on it and enhance it for future generations A high international reputation makes all the difference to Singapore I have spoken about the importance of unity, a go-getting mindset and a good reputation But the quality of a country's government and leaders matters too Last week, I met the CEO of a major farmer company We talked about his projects in Singapore He listed the reasons why they had decided to invest here, big time High quality people, predictable policies, and a government that is doing the right thing He said that ultimately, companies value good government, stable politics, and a system that works He said, I quote, what I want is a place that I can trust This, meaning Singapore, is a country you can trust and which the world can trust But there is no formula that can guarantee that our system will continue to work well for the long term Last year, when Parliament debated the importance of honesty and integrity in public life I spoke about the importance and the difficulty of maintaining the ideals and values of a country beyond its founding generation Honesty and integrity are a crucial part of our success formula But it goes beyond that It is equally essential and hard to keep the whole system working through the decades Attitudes and mindsets change, new stresses and strains will appear People forget the values and the experience of the founding generation Slowly things can go awry and start to fall apart Nothing can magically prevent Singapore from going down this road What we can do to give ourselves the best chance of staying on the right track Is to make sure that our economy is sound and our institutions are in place and strong Our people have the skills and instincts to work hard, work together, and earn a living for ourselves Our accumulated reserves are well managed, well protected, earn credible returns, and give us a critical advantage in major crisis Our leaders are capable, dedicated, and trustworthy stewards Worthy of their responsibility to Singapore, to this and future generations To ensure a good leadership for the long term is an unending and demanding challenge for successive generations But what I and my older colleagues can do and will make sure of is to prepare a strong and capable next team to take over from us Then the new leaders can take Singapore further forward and the country has the chance to produce and support new generations of leaders To come after them who will be up to their job This we have done The 4G team is in place during the pandemic Singaporeans experienced first hand the importance of strong political leadership Our population rose to the occasion, the public service performed magnificently But our response and the results would have been very different without political leaders who could set the direction, make the tough calls and rally the people together The MTF ministers were in the hot seat, but the whole 4G team played a key role It was a formative experience for the 4G ministers Handling the crisis, they got the measure of each other and gained confidence in each other's judgement and abilities The 4G ministers are increasingly responsible for the safety and wellbeing of the country They have a strong agenda to fulfil domestically and internationally But they cannot do it on their own They need the support of every Singaporean, including members of this House to see through Last year, the 4G ministers chose DPM Wang to be their leader I asked you to give Lawrence and the 4G ministers your full support I asked you to give them your full support for now as members of my team but in due course when they take over the reins as the next leadership for Singapore Help me make this leadership success, this leadership renewal, a success for Singapore and for you Show your support for a government that works hard and works well for you Elect leaders whom you can trust to take us forward Give yourselves the best chance to keep our system working well for Singaporeans for many years to come We are heading into a troubled world, this is probably the 10th time I have told you this If there is no other message you are taking away from this speech There is much work to be done and to be done quickly Our 4FAR this worked hard to build up the Singapore that we have today They didn't let themselves be constrained by our small size or limited resources They were not powerful but they fought hard to make our voice heard on the international stage They were not well off but they tightened their belts to create a better future for us Their descendants Against long odds they determined to forge a prosperous nation and a united people and they succeeded We too must embrace their can-do spirit and outsize their ambition to be an extraordinary country An exceptional place in the world Maintain our international reputation and build on our trusted Singapore brand of quality, reliability and efficiency Make full use of our strengths and turn opportunities into successes Stand up for what we believe in and uphold consistent principles to advance Singapore's long-term interests This is a way for Singapore to be taken seriously and to count for more than our size We may be a small island state but we are not as small people and neither are our hearts nor our aspirations We must seek boldly, aim high and seek far Let us work together, government and people to build the Singapore that we and our children will all be proud of Thank you very much, Mrs. Speaker\n"
