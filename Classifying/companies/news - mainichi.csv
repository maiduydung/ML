Study: Chinese COVID shot may offer elderly poor protection,"BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) -- A new study suggests that a Sinopharm vaccine offers poor protection from COVID-19 among the elderly, raising questions for dozens of countries that have given the Chinese company's shots to their most vulnerable populations.

A survey of blood samples taken from 450 people in Hungary at least two weeks after their second Sinopharm dose found that 90% under 50 years old developed protective antibodies. But the percentage declined with age, and 50% of those over 80 had none.

The study by two Hungarian researchers was posted online this week but not yet reviewed by other scientists. Three outside experts said they had no problems with the methodology of the study of the vaccine developed by Sinopharm's Beijing Institute of Biological Products.

""This is very, very worrying that these people, who are high-risk, have a poor antibody response,"" said Jin Dong-yan, a Hong Kong University virologist who was not affiliated with the study.

Antibody levels are not a direct measure of how protected a person is from COVID-19, but there is growing evidence that they are a good proxy. One expert cautioned that the choice of test kits could have limited the accuracy of the measurements.

Still, the study's findings have value and are the first public, scientific attempt to analyze the effect of the Sinopharm vaccine in the elderly, said Wang Chenguang, a former professor at Peking Union Medical College and an immunology expert.

China's National Health Commission declined to comment on the study, saying it would only respond to studies by governments or major research institutions.

This is not the first time questions have been raised about the efficacy of the vaccine, which was given a greenlight by the World Health Organization in May and is being used in more than 50 countries, many of which seized upon it when other vaccines were tough to come by.

A spokesperson for the WHO said Wednesday that its experts ""are aware of the study and continue to look at all available evidence."" The agency's advisers raised questions months ago about whether it provided protection in people 60 and over, but when it was OK'd a WHO expert said that there was no reason to think it would work differently in the elderly.

The vaccine is one of two similar shots developed by Sinopharm. The state-owned Chinese company's research showed that almost all the participants in final-stage clinical trials were under 60 -- and its own researchers said there was insufficient evidence to say whether the vaccines work in the elderly. Overall, the Beijing Institute vaccine was found to be 78% effective.

In Hungary, concern about the shots led many to seek out private antibody tests. Eventually the capital city of Budapest offered free testing to elderly residents as part a bid to ratchet up pressure on the government to conduct its own wider survey and provide booster shots to those who need them.

After initially rebuffing calls for a government response to efficacy concerns -- including from the antibody study's authors Balazs Sarkadi and Tamas Ferenci -- Prime Minster Viktor Orban finally acquiesced last week in the face of growing public anger. He announced that the government would provide its citizens with an optional third shot.

His office said, though, that all vaccines authorized by Hungary are effective.

The United Arab Emirates and Bahrain both announced in May that they, too, would offer a third dose of Sinopharm amid concerns about an insufficient antibody response. Bahrain recommended that people over 50 and some other vulnerable people receive Pfizer-BioNTech's vaccine as their booster regardless of whether they got Sinopharm initially.

CNBG, the Sinopharm subsidiary that oversees the Beijing Institute, has said a third dose is not part of the company's clinical guidance.

It's not clear how many doses of the Beijing Institute Sinopharm vaccine have been exported. Overall, China exported 500 million vaccines doses in the first half of the year, and the company is one of country's two major COVID vaccine makers, along with privately owned Sinovac.

The Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization recently ordered 550 million doses from the two companies for the U.N.-backed COVAX program.

Both Sinopharm vaccines are also in wide use in China, including in the elderly. The country's National Health Commission said in April that the shots provide some protection, even though it acknowledged that early stages of clinical trials of Sinopharm's vaccines and two others found fewer antibodies in people 60 and over.

In Budapest, Beata Englohner became concerned for her 76-year-old mother after hearing that people who had been vaccinated with Sinopharm were shown to have no antibodies.

Englohner started a Facebook group to press the government to address the issue. She is cautiously optimistic now that Hungary will offer a third dose.

""We're very glad that we achieved our aim and that we were heard,"" she said. ""Though we're a bit afraid that we'll receive what we already got before.""","July 24, 2021",0,1
Interview: Japan minister urges vaccines for young,"OKYO (AP) -- As Olympics host Tokyo saw another record number of coronavirus cases Wednesday, Japan's vaccination minister said the speed of the country's inoculation campaign is less urgent than getting shots to young adults, whom some health experts are blaming for the current surge in infections.

Taro Kono told The Associated Press that Japan is ""overshooting"" its goal of a million shots a day, so ""speed doesn't matter anymore."" He said Japan is averaging about 10 million shots a week after a late start that critics have blamed on extra red tape.

""Even if we slow down a little bit, I'm OK. Rather, we need to reach out to the younger people, so that they would feel that it's necessary for them to get vaccinated,"" Kono said during an interview in his office. ""If we could vaccinate (those in their) 20s or people in (their) 30s for 80% or higher, it would be a good number for me.""

He said officials will turn to the internet to get the message out to young adults and work to combat vaccine misinformation. Young adults are now eligible for vaccinations under Japan's largely age-based immunization system, but many are not eager.

Tokyo reported 3,177 new coronavirus cases Wednesday, an all-time high for the city and the first time it exceeded 3,000 infections in a day. The new cases bring the total for the Japanese capital to 206,745 since the pandemic began.

Tokyo is under its fourth state of emergency, which will last through the Olympics and stop two days before the Paralympics begin Aug. 24. Experts had earlier warned that the more contagious delta variant could cause a surge during the Olympics, which started Friday.

Some scientists have questioned holding the Tokyo Games at all, and there is widespread public opposition to them. Many fear that the tens of thousands of visitors will make the virus situation worse.

Kono said he was confident that a ""bubble"" is keeping Olympic visitors away from regular Japanese citizens, reducing the risk of more cases. He also said he didn't think the Games would create a ""Tokyo variant"" of the virus that could spread around the globe.

""We're not really worried about that issue,"" Kono said.

The International Olympic Committee says more than 80% of athletes and staff staying in the Olympic Village have been vaccinated -- and they are expected to remain largely in the locked-down athletes' village and venues. Still, the bubble is based more on the honor system than official enforcement.

Vaccination rates are not clear for other participants coming from abroad, many of whom are staying in Tokyo hotels, and experts warn that even strict rules won't prevent people from mingling, especially among non-athletes.

""There's a limit to the bubble,"" with reporters and other people going in and out, said Dr. Kazuhiro Tateda, a Toho University infectious diseases expert who is on a government COVID-19 panel.

While Japan has so far kept its cases and deaths lower than many other countries, its vaccination campaign started with health care workers only in mid-February, behind many other large economies. Japan required additional clinical testing for the vaccines, a time-consuming step that many experts called medically meaningless.

Kono said Parliament demanded the additional tests, and that there's a long history of people suing the government over vaccination campaigns.

""Now we've learned a lesson, so if there's going to be another pandemic, I think we would do it a different way, for sure,"" Kono said.

Health experts have noted that cases among younger, unvaccinated people are rising sharply. While about two-thirds of Wednesday's cases were people in their 30s or below, those in their 40s and 50s now dominate Tokyo's nearly 3,000 hospitalized patients and are gradually filling up available beds.

Dr. Ryuji Wakita, director general of the National Institute of Infections Diseases and head of a government advisory board, said vaccination progress has been limited mostly to elderly people.

Wakita acknowledged that the rise of serious cases is modest compared to the sharp increase of daily cases, but even so, the ongoing surge could cause younger and unvaccinated patients to develop serious cases while being left untreated.

Inoculations for the elderly started in mid-April, but were slowed by initial supply shortages, cumbersome reservation procedures and a lack of medical workers to give shots. The pace then picked up in mid-May when imports stabilized and more staff to give the shots was secured.

The government says 33.4 million people, or 26.3% of the public, have been fully vaccinated and 47 million, or 37%, have had at least one shot as of Monday. About 25 million elderly people, or about 70%, are completely inoculated while 30 million, or 85%, have had at least one dose.

Despite Kono's comments on the speed of inoculations, there are still worries about the vaccination pace.

Workplace inoculations began in mid-June, with thousands of companies applying for a chance to vaccinate employees. But the government then indefinitely stopped taking such applications because of tight vaccine supplies and vaccinations at about half of 5,000 worksite locations have been on hold.

Vaccine distributions from the central government to municipalities also declined, from 18.7 million doses in June to 12 million doses for July-August, forcing towns across the country to postpone or suspend vaccination reservations.

Japan had received about 100 million COVID-19 vaccine doses by June, and an additional 70 million shots are expected between July and September. Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga has tried to accelerate the delivery of vaccines, including in a meeting with the CEO of Pfizer.

Suga is under increasing pressure, and his political future may be tied in part to an Olympics that are perceived as successful. There's also the geopolitical competition with rival Beijing, the next Olympics host, to make sure the Games go off without major calamity.

Asked about the political considerations of going through with the Tokyo Games, Kono said: ""I think it's irrelevant.""","July 28, 2021",1,3
COVID-19 vaccinations completed for 5.67 million medical workers in Japan,"TOKYO -- Taro Kono, minister in charge of administrative reform and COVID-19 vaccination efforts, announced at a July 27 news conference that vaccinations for medical workers in all 47 of Japan's prefectures had been completed as of July 23.

The National Governors' Association, which assesses the vaccination situation in each prefecture, also made the announcement on its website on July 27.

Though it was initially envisaged that around 4.8 million medical workers would be subject to inoculations, as many as 5.67 million workers had received two shots, according to the Japanese government's tally.

Inoculations of medical workers began on Feb. 17 ahead of the general public. Vaccinations in the last remaining prefecture of Hyogo were completed on July 23.

Kono commented in a news conference, ""Though the number of medical workers far exceeded the initial assumption, the task has been completed anyway."" He explained that medical workers who required vaccinations later would receive shots in the same way as the general public.","July 28, 2021",1,5
"As Japan rolls out vaccine passports, numerous challenges still lie ahead","TOKYO -- Japan faces a plethora of issues as its local municipalities nationwide have kickstarted accepting applications for so-called ""vaccine passports"" that publicly certify holders have been fully vaccinated against COVID-19.

If presented upon arrival in a foreign country, holders of the passports will be exempted from quarantine measures. While the government expects the new travel documents will help resume Japanese business activities abroad, their effects are still limited as there are only seven countries that currently accept entry of vaccine passport holders. Domestic use of the passports, as demanded by Japanese business circles, also poses a number of issues such as how to prevent discrimination against those who are not inoculated.

""It's an essential tool that can lead to resuming people's movements across borders,"" said Chief Cabinet Secretary Katsunobu Kato at a press conference on July 26, underscoring the significance of introducing the vaccine passport system, as the acceptance of applications for the documents got underway across Japan the same day.

""Holders of the passports will be exempted from presenting documents proving their negative coronavirus test results upon entry, self-isolation and retesting after isolation, among other procedures,"" Kato said.

So far, Italy, Austria, Turkey, Bulgaria, Poland, South Korea and Estonia recognize the passports as one of the necessary documents for travelers to be exempted from quarantine steps. In South Korea, travelers also need to present other documents to be spared quarantine, while Estonia does not isolate arrivals.

The Japanese government began looking into introducing vaccine passports for its people in around mid-May. As other countries preceded in debating the system, the Japan Business Federation, the nation's most powerful business lobby commonly known as Keidanren, demanded that the government introduce the initiative. Some lawmakers in both the ruling and opposition parties, also expressed concerns for Japan lagging behind, with Seiji Maehara of the Democratic Party for the People saying, ""Japan would become like the Galapagos Islands (meaning 'become detached from the world') when vaccine passports become worldwide standards in this global society.""

However, as the United States has maintained reservations about vaccine passports, with each state taking a different approach to the documents, some within the Japanese government were initially skeptical about the efficacy of the system, with one official asking, ""Will it really become necessary internationally?""

Yet once the European Union and other areas decided to adopt vaccine passports, the Japanese business community stepped up their calls for introducing the initiative, with one individual stating, ""We'll get behind if we remain closed off to the world."" A senior official of the prime minister's office explained, ""We never know when vaccine passports will become a worldwide trend. We are introducing the system in preparation for that.""

The biggest challenge lying ahead is how many more countries will adopt vaccine passports. While there are many cases in which two countries mutually relax epidemic prevention measures for vaccine passport holders under mutual authentication agreements, Japan imposes significant restrictions on entrants as part of its COVID-19 countermeasures. Even if travelers are from the seven countries abroad that have adopted vaccine passports and have mutual agreement with Japan, arrivals still need to present their negative test certificates and undergo 14-day isolation at hotels and elsewhere. As it stands, Japan has to ask the seven countries to accept these strict entry conditions as they are, while requesting those countries to unilaterally relax their requirements.

It was apparently this hurdle that lay behind the failure for Japan to reach an agreement with France regarding mutual authentication, even though they had been regarded highly likely to reach an accord. Furthermore, if Japan is to strike a deal with China, Japan may be required to accept the efficacy of inoculation certificates for Chinese-made COVID-19 vaccines, which it has yet to authorize. ""As coronavirus infections continue to spread in Japan, public opinion will not accept border control relaxation through mutual authentication,"" commented a Japanese government insider.

How to utilize vaccine passports domestically is yet another issue requiring future investigation. While the Japanese business community is asking for the domestic use of vaccine passports, there are concerns that it could lead to discrimination against those who are not vaccinated if they are barred from entering shops, venues and other places. At a news conference on July 21, Chief Cabinet Secretary Kato expressed a cautious stance, stating, ""It's not appropriate if vaccine passports lead to forcible inoculations or unjust discrimination.""

Nevertheless, some within the government and the ruling Liberal Democratic Party are voicing their expectations for the domestic use of vaccine passports. ""It would brighten the public mood, instead of constraining them solely through requests to refrain from various activities,"" noted a former Cabinet minister, while a senior administration official remarked, ""If the vaccination rate stagnates in the future, the domestic use of vaccine passports could motivate people to get inoculated.""

Takahide Kiuchi, executive economist at the Nomura Research Institute, pointed out, ""No matter what the government might say, there will be a growing momentum in the private sector to capitalize on vaccine passports (toward the recovery of economic activities)."" In some areas in Japan, people holding full vaccination certificates issued by municipal governments are already benefiting from various services, such as discounts on dining and drinking and relaxed conditions for entry to event venues and other places. The central government is also poised to discern the results of these initiatives in weighing the pros and cons of promoting the domestic use of vaccine passports.","July 28, 2021",1,3
"Tokyo reports record 3,865 COVID-19 cases on July 29","TOKYO -- The Tokyo Metropolitan Government reported a record 3,865 coronavirus infections on July 29, exceeding the previous highest figure of 3,177 observed a day earlier and topping the 3,000 mark for the second day in a row.

Tokyo remains under a fourth COVID-19 state of emergency as it hosts the Olympic Games.

The capital saw an average of 631.7 coronavirus cases per day in the first week of July. The daily average for the second week rose to 823.3, before jumping to 1,277.6 in the third week. In the fourth week, it spiked by nearly 1,000, to 2,216.4. In June, Tokyo recorded a total of 12,979 new coronavirus cases, or a daily average of 432.6, down from the daily average of 705.8 in May.

By July 28, a total of 2,285 people had died of COVID-19 in Tokyo since the pandemic began in the spring of 2020.

Tokyo has recorded 210,610 infections to date, the most of any of Japan's 47 prefectures. As of July 28, there were 2,995 COVID-19 patients in hospital, 80 with severe symptoms.","July 29, 2021",0,1
Editorial: PM Suga's optimism questionable amid Tokyo's 5th wave of COVID-19 cases,"The fifth wave of coronavirus infections in Tokyo, which comes amid a state of emergency in the capital while the Olympic Games are in full swing, shows no sign of abating.

On July 28, the number of coronavirus cases in the capital topped 3,100, reaching a daily high for the second day in a row. The average for the week was about 1.5 times higher than that of the previous week.

What makes the situation serious is that while over two weeks have passed since the state of emergency was issued, the number of infections has not decreased -- unlike during previous states of emergency.

Serious COVID-19 cases have increased predominantly among those in their 50s, many of whom have not yet been vaccinated. But even among those with moderate symptoms, there are some people who need to be given high concentrations of oxygen, requiring the same kind of medical support as that given to people with severe symptoms of the respiratory disease.

Moreover, it is becoming increasingly difficult to quickly find hospitals to give people emergency medical care, and regular medical treatment will likely be restricted to secure beds for coronavirus patients. In the medical field, a sense of crisis over the hospital bed crunch is growing stronger.

In Saitama and other prefectures whose living spheres overlap with Tokyo, infection numbers are reaching record highs. The government should declare a state of emergency in those prefectures and take aligned measures.

Unless the number of infections is brought under control, the overall number of COVID-19 patients will continue to increase, and the medical system will eventually reach its breaking point. Yet we see no sense of urgency in the response taken by Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga.

Even though the number of infections has been rising, Suga has merely called for people to ""avoid going out unnecessarily, and to watch the Olympics on TV.""

Suga has also rejected the possibility of canceling the Olympics, stating that ""the flow of people is decreasing, and there are no concerns.""

But in fact, crowds have not decreased compared to during the previous state of emergency. And the spread of a strongly infectious variant of the coronavirus is a cause for concern.

The Tokyo Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games has stated that if there is a major change in the state of coronavirus infections, then it will hold five-party talks with the Tokyo metropolitan and central governments and others to discuss a response. It is necessary to pay attention to changes in the situation, and adapt to the circumstances.

It has been pointed out the effects of the state of emergency are growing weaker. Members of the public are growing tired of self-restraint and are becoming accustomed to the pandemic, and the number of restaurants not complying with requests to shorten business hours is increasing.

The prime minister will not be able to win the public's cooperation with weakly grounded optimism. To avoid a worst-case scenario of a collapse of Japan's medical system, the prime minister should send out a clear message to ensure that people thoroughly follow coronavirus countermeasures and don't let their guard down.","July 29, 2021",0,1
Tokyo governor urges youth to get vaccinated to slow surge,"TOKYO (AP) -- Tokyo Gov. Yuriko Koike on Wednesday urged younger people to cooperate with measures to bring down the high number of infections and get vaccinated, saying their activities are key to slowing the surge during the Olympics.

On Tuesday, the Japanese capital reported 2,848 new cases, exceeding its previous record in January.

Koike noted that the majority of the elderly have been fully vaccinated and infections among them have largely decreased, while the mostly unvaccinated younger people are now dominating the new cases.

""Younger people's activity holds the key (to slowing the infections), and we need your cooperation,"" Koike said. ""Please make sure to avoid nonessential outings and observe basic anti-infection measures, and I would like younger people to get vaccinated.""

As of Tuesday, 25.5% of the Japanese population has been fully vaccinated. The percentage of the elderly who are fully vaccinated is 68.2%, or 36 million people.

Vaccination prospects for the younger have improved, and some can get their shots organized by work places and colleges, while others still wait based on seniority. But there are also concerns over hesitancy among the young, with surveys showing many of them having doubts, in part due to fake rumors about side effects.

Younger people have been blamed for roaming downtown areas after the requested closing hours for eateries and stores and spreading the virus. Tokyo is under its fourth state of emergency, which is to continue through the Olympics, but it mainly focuses on requiring establishments to stop serving alcohol and shorten their hours. Measures for the public are only requests and they are increasingly ignored.

Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga has also urged people to avoid nonessential outings but says there is no need to consider a suspension of the Games, which are held with no fans in Tokyo and three neighboring prefectures -- Chiba, Kanagawa and Saitama.

Governors of the three areas, alarmed by Tokyo's surging cases, said on Wednesday they plan to jointly ask Suga to place their prefectures under the state of emergency too.

Nationwide, Japan reported 5,020 cases in the last 24 hours for a total of 870,445 and 15,129 confirmed deaths.

Japan has kept its cases and deaths lower than many other countries. Its seven-day rolling average of cases is about 3.57 per 100,000 people, compared to 2.76 in India, 17.3 in the United States and 53.1 in Britain, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.","July 28, 2021",0,2
Golgo 13' manga panels deployed at Japan vaccine centers to encourage greater uptake,"TOKYO -- Duke Togo, protagonist of Takao Saito's long-running manga series ""Golgo 13"" and Japan's most famous fictional assassin, is being ""deployed"" by the government to vaccination centers as a way to encourage people to get vaccinated for COVID-19.

As part of the scheme, panels featuring manga story frames titled ""Assignment from K"" have been set up at large-scale vaccination centers operated by the Japan Self-Defense Forces in Tokyo and Osaka on July 26, with a hope that vaccinated individuals will photograph themselves next to the panels and spread the word on inoculation via social media.

In the panels, crack sniper Togo is seen sitting shirtless on a bed in a medical examination room. He asks the doctor present, ""I heard the Japanese government has a pressing assignment ... What is it?"" The doctor answers, ""They want you to spread vaccine uptake to beat the coronavirus,"" then produces a syringe. The dialogue has been created by adapting existing panels from the manga.

The new scheme came about thanks to connections between the manga's creators and the government forged in the 2018 production of a Ministry of Foreign Affairs video that used ""Golgo 13"" to advise Japanese nationals abroad on safety measures they should take. Vaccine tsar and current Minister in charge of Administrative Reform Taro Kono was minister of foreign affairs at the time.

The panel aims to urge young, middle-aged and older people to get inoculated while vaccinations among elderly people are progressing. It stresses the importance of the shots by highlighting the risks of death and long-term complications from severe COVID-19 symptoms.

On a July 26 visit to a Tokyo large-scale vaccination center, vaccination minister Kono said, ""We want people vaccinated here to take photos (with the cartoon panel) and by tweeting, spread vaccinations among individuals of the same generation.""

Though reporters asked details about the panel's title, ""Assignment from K,"" Kono only said, ""I'll be made to disappear if I speak carelessly.""

But despite their wishes to, many young, middle-aged and older people still can't get vaccinated. Perhaps Togo should be tasked with procuring vaccines?","July 27, 2021",1,3
Japan starts accepting applications for 'vaccine passports',"TOKYO (Kyodo) -- Japan began accepting applications Monday for so-called vaccine passports for people who have been fully inoculated against COVID-19 to travel internationally, as Japanese business lobbies have called for their introduction to help facilitate business activities.

So far, Italy, Austria, Turkey, Bulgaria and Poland have agreed to ease COVID-19 quarantine rules for holders of the Japanese certificates, while South Korea will also accept them as one of the documents needed in exempting holders from quarantine requirements, according to the Japanese government.

Estonia has also agreed to accept the certificate, although it currently does not impose quarantine regardless of whether the person has been vaccinated or not. The Japanese government is now in talks with other countries to expand the use of its vaccine passports.

""We consider it to be an important tool in resuming international travel going forward,"" said Chief Cabinet Secretary Katsunobu Kato at a regular news conference.

But the top government spokesman also urged people to refrain from applying for the certificate unless they have plans to travel abroad to prevent a flood of applications.

The certificates will be official records issued free of charge by local municipalities showing a person has been fully inoculated against COVID-19, with information such as name, passport number and date of vaccination also included.

People who wish to obtain the certificates will be required to submit in person or via mail documents, including the application form, passport and vaccination tickets.

The application form and the certificate are currently restricted to paper, but the Japanese government is seeking to eventually introduce digital application and issuance.

In the morning, businesspeople and foreign nationals were seen coming in for applications at a public health center in Tokyo's Minato Ward.

Among them, Junji Shirota, 34, scheduled to study at a British graduate school, received the certificate in less than 20 minutes.

""I heard I need to present this when I enter restaurants and bars in Britain, so now I can travel with relief,"" he said.

The country's largest business lobby, the Japan Business Federation, known as Keidanren, has proposed that the certificates be also used to raise event attendance caps and for restaurant discounts in Japan.

But such use is feared to increase the burden on local governments, which process the applications, leading to discrimination against people who have not been vaccinated.

Still, some restaurants and hotels within Japan are already giving discounts to people who present their vaccination records.

The Japanese government is stepping up its vaccination rollout, which has been slow compared with other developed countries. The program began in February with health care workers and expanded to those aged 65 or older from April, while people under 65 have recently started receiving shots in some municipalities and by companies for their employees.

But a recent supply shortfall is forcing some municipalities to restrict accepting reservations while new applications by companies have been suspended.

Suga has said he aims to finish inoculating all eligible people in Japan who wish to receive shots by November.","July 26, 2021",1,3
"Central Japan hotels, inns offering special perks to vaccinated guests","NAGOYA -- With Japan heading into summer vacation season while still cautious of spreading coronavirus infections, a number of central Japan hotels and inns are trying to lure more customers with special services for guests vaccinated against COVID-19.

Kaiei Ryokans, based in Minamichita, Aichi Prefecture, operates 19 accommodation facilities nationwide, primarily in the central Japan Chubu region. The firm is offering special new plans for guests who have received their second round of vaccinations.

The program, billed as the ""commemoration of completing vaccinations,"" grants special privileges including souvenirs worth 1,000 yen (about $9.00), a copy of a newspaper containing the guests' photo to commemorate the date of their stay, and free room or meal upgrades until the end of July.

So far, the plans have reportedly been popular with medical professionals and elderly couples aged 65 or older, who had priority doses, among other guests. As inoculations progress among younger generations, the company expects more people will be eligible for the incentive plans.

""We felt there must be many people relieved to have wrapped up their double shots, so we instilled the program with our regard for their efforts,"" a company public relations official said. ""I hope our guests will relax at our inns, where infection prevention measures are thoroughly in place.""

Meanwhile, Nagoya Prince Hotel Sky Tower in Nagoya's Nakamura Ward launched a new service on July 22 that allows vaccinated people and those who aren't to stay together at ease.

Under the plan, all members of a group including at least one vaccinated individual can have polymerase chain reaction tests in advance while paying only the room charge. Once the reservation is made, testing kits will be sent to potential guests' homes, and test results can be provided by the night before their planned stay.

The hotel expects the plan will see uptake from families and other groups who have long refrained from travel or returning to their hometowns during the repeated coronavirus infections resurgences.

""We'd be happy if fully vaccinated elderly customers can enjoy a secure stay here together with their grandchildren,"" said a public relations official.

Guests who test negative for the virus can have breakfast in a private room upon presenting their test results.","July 26, 2021",1,3
Japan PM Suga asks Pfizer CEO to bring forward COVID-19 vaccine delivery amid shortage,"TOKYO (Kyodo) -- Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga met with Pfizer Inc. CEO Albert Bourla in Tokyo on Friday and asked the U.S. firm to bring forward some of its COVID-19 vaccine deliveries planned for this fall in the face of concerns in the country about a supply shortage, officials said.

Their 40-minute meeting over breakfast at the Akasaka Palace state guest house, which is usually used to welcome heads of state, came after prefectural governors and mayors, who had hoped to speed up the vaccination drive at local levels, criticized the central government over a slowdown in the rollout.

Japan contracted with the U.S. pharmaceutical giant to receive 100 million vaccine doses by June with another 70 million due to be shipped between July and September and another 20 million in or after October.

Suga requested at the meeting that the 20 million doses from October be brought forward, the officials said.

Talks on the issue are expected to continue, the officials said.

Taro Kono, the minister in charge of vaccination efforts, accompanied Suga.

Some local governments have been forced to halt their vaccination programs after vaccine demand began to outstrip supply.

According to the latest available government data, about 23 percent of Japan's population has been fully inoculated against COVID-19 as of Wednesday, with about 35 percent having received at least one shot.","July 23, 2021",1,4
Infections won't decline even if 60% of population vaccinated: Japan task force head,"TOKYO -- Shigeru Omi, head of the government's coronavirus countermeasures subcommittee, said in an evening TV program on July 20, ""Unfortunately, this virus is so strong that infections can't be brought under control even if about 60% of the population receives them (the vaccine).""

In the Nippon Television Network Corp.'s program, Omi expressed his view that it would be difficult to obtain herd immunity even if the vaccination rate increased, and that restrictions on daily and economic activities should be eased carefully.

Omi pointed out that ""if 60 to 70% of the population is inoculated, the number of seriously ill patients will decrease, but infections cannot be completely prevented.""

When asked about how the U.K. ended most of its infection countermeasures such as mask mandates and restrictions on the number of participants at events in England on July 19, including London, he replied, ""That's a pretty risky way to go about it. Japan should be a little more careful.""

Omi also predicted that if the number of new infections continue to increase at the current pace in Tokyo, coronavirus cases will double in two weeks and exceed the peak of the ""third wave"" when it saw a record high of infections around the year-end and the New Year holidays.

""We're arriving at the toughest time ever. The collapse of the health care system is possible, so I want everyone to make one last effort,"" he said.

The coronavirus subcommittee has announced that it plans to put together a guideline on the way of life when the vaccine rollout has progressed by Aug. 22 -- the deadline for the current state of emergency.","July 21, 2021",1,3
Takeda to import extra 50 mil. Moderna COVID-19 doses to Japan in 2022,"TOKYO (Kyodo) -- Japan's Takeda Pharmaceutical Co. said Tuesday it will import an additional 50 million doses of U.S. developer Moderna Inc.'s coronavirus vaccine from as early as the beginning of 2022, in a move that could help speed up inoculation efforts in the country.

The additional doses, to be provided based on a three-way agreement with Moderna and the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare, will bring the total number of doses of the vaccine to 100 million. Takeda handles the sale and distribution of the vaccine in Japan.

Takeda said the agreement ""includes the potential to secure and supply vaccines corresponding to COVID-19 variants or booster products, should they be successfully developed by Moderna"" and licensed by the ministry.

It is not yet known how long the effect of the COVID-19 vaccine will last. Other countries have begun administering booster shots, or third or subsequent doses, to prolong immunity.

In response to the agreement, health minister Norihisa Tamura told reporters, ""We will continue to work together to ensure a smooth supply of vaccines.""

The Japanese government has already signed an agreement to receive 50 million doses of Moderna's vaccine by the end of 2021. The vaccine is being used in mass vaccination sites and workplace inoculations in Japan, but the government has said supplies are limited.

Discussions are also under way between the health ministry and Takeda to secure 150 million doses of the vaccine developed by U.S. pharmaceutical giant Novavax Inc. starting in early 2022.","July 20, 2021",1,4
Health ministry panel approves Moderna COVID vaccine for ages 12-17,"TOKYO (Kyodo) -- A Japanese health ministry panel on Monday approved Moderna Inc.'s COVID-19 vaccine for ages 12 to 17, clearing the way for it to become the second shot available to adolescents in the country after the one developed by Pfizer Inc.

The Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare is expected to decide at a later date to provide the Moderna vaccine free of charge to the age group as part of the government's nationwide vaccination program.

Among the more than 3,700 subjects aged 12 to 17 who took part in clinical trials in the United States, none developed signs of COVID-19 within 14 days of receiving a second dose, while four in a group that was given placebos showed symptoms.

The U.S. biotechnology firm has also filed with drug authorities in the United States, Canada and the European Union for use of the vaccine in adolescents.

Japan is administering the Moderna vaccine, to which it granted emergency approval for people aged 18 and older in May, at vaccinations centers run by the Self-Defense Forces in Tokyo and Osaka, as well as large sites set up by local governments, companies and universities.

But the minister in charge of vaccination efforts, Taro Kono, has warned that supply is struggling to keep up with demand, making it unclear when adolescents will be able to receive shots.

The health ministry panel also approved the use of casirivimab and imdevimab for an ""antibody cocktail"" developed by U.S. firm Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc. and famously used to treat then U.S. President Donald Trump for COVID-19.

Clinical trials showed the treatment, marketed as REGEN-COV, lowered the risk of hospitalization or death by about 70 percent.","July 19, 2021",1,4
Taiwan government  approves production of 1st local COVID-19 vaccine,"TAIPEI (Kyodo) -- The Taiwan government approved on Monday the production and emergency use of the first locally developed COVID-19 vaccine, a landmark event in the self-ruled island's fight against the deadly coronavirus.

Food and Drug Administration Director General Wu Shou-mei, speaking to the press at the Central Epidemic Command Center, also said that the vaccine produced by Medigen Vaccine Biologics Corp. should gradually become available starting next month.

""(Medigen) is designed for people aged over 20 who will get two shots 28 days apart,"" Wu said.

The Taiwan-based biopharmaceutical company announced on June 10 that it had completed the second phase of clinical trials for its COVID-19 vaccine candidate and that the results met the safety standards set by the FDA for an emergency use authorization.

As the company was granted the emergency use authorization, it is working to conduct phase three clinical trials at home and abroad to seek international recognition.

The Taiwan government has signed contracts to purchase 5 million doses of the Medigen vaccine and another 5 million doses from another local vaccine maker, United Biomedical Inc., whose application for emergency use authorization is still pending.

The government has also signed contracts to purchase nearly 20 million vaccines from Moderna, AstraZeneca and unspecified brands through the global COVAX facility.

As of Sunday, a total of 5.19 million COVID-19 vaccine doses had been administered in Taiwan, covering about 22 percent of the total population.

President Tsai Ing-wen has set the goal of having 20 to 25 percent of the population receiving at least one dose of the two-shot vaccine regimen by the end of this month.","July 19, 2021",1,3
56% say Japan's COVID-19 vaccine rollout not going smoothly: Mainichi poll,"A nationwide public opinion poll found that 56% of those surveyed do not think that Japan's vaccine rollout is going smoothly, down 4 percentage points from the previous survey conducted on June 19.

The survey was conducted July 17 by the Mainichi Shimbun and the Social Survey Research Center.

Meanwhile, 27% of those polled -- the same percentage as in the previous survey -- said that they believed the rollout was going smoothly, while 17% said they cannot say either way, down from 21% in the previous poll.

The Japanese government has made it its goal to finish vaccinating those aged 65 and older by the end of July, and to finish vaccinating all others who want to be by the end of November. But the vaccine supply has been disrupted, and many local governments have stopped taking vaccine appointments, leading an increasing number of people to believe that the rollout is in trouble.

Asked about their vaccination status, 29% of those polled said that they had been vaccinated, up from the 12% in the June survey, and 3% in the survey before that, taken on May 22. Those who said that they would ""get vaccinated immediately"" if they became eligible accounted for 50% of those polled, down from 57% in the June poll, while 15% said they would take a ""wait and see"" approach, down from 24% in the previous poll. Meanwhile, 4%, the same percentage as in the previous poll, said they would ""not get the vaccination,"" and 1%, also the same figure as in the previous poll, said they ""did not know.""

The administration of Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga sees vaccinations as the trump card to bringing the coronavirus crisis under control. But among those polled who said they were already vaccinated, less than 30% said they approved of the Suga Cabinet, which is not far off from the trend among all respondents.

On July 12, the Japanese government declared Tokyo's fourth state of emergency over the coronavirus. Asked whether they believed the declarations curb the spread of infections, only 16% said they ""believed they have an effect."" Meanwhile, 66% of those surveyed said they ""did not believe they have an effect,"" and 18% said they ""could not say either way."" The state of emergency is set to run until Aug. 22, meaning that in Tokyo, about 70% of all days this year up to that point will have been under a state of emergency. The emergency has become the new normal, leading many to believe that it does not impact people's behaviors much.

Heavy rains have caused disasters in many parts of the country. When asked whether respondents believed that their communities were in danger of such disasters, 45% said they ""believed they were in danger,"" while 37% said ""they were not in danger,"" and 17% said they ""did not know."" By age group, over 40% among those between the ages of 18 to 69 said they ""believed they were in danger,"" but among those 70 and older, less than 30% said so.

Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga's term as the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP)'s president will end at the end of September. When those surveyed were asked how long they wanted him to serve as PM, only 14%, down 1 point from the previous poll, said they wanted him ""to continue for as long as possible,"" while 45%, also down 1 point from the previous poll, said they wanted him ""to continue until the end of his current term."" Those who said they wanted him to ""step down as soon as possible"" accounted for 40% of respondents, up 1 point from the last poll.

As for political party approval ratings, the LDP garnered the most support with 28%, down 2 points from the last survey. The main opposition Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan (CDP) held steady at 10%, while the Japanese Communist Party (JCP)'s support rating rose by 1 point to 7%. Nippon Ishin no Kai (Japan Innovation Party) kept its support rating at 6%, while Komeito was also unchanged at 4%, and the Democratic Party for the People (DPFP) kept its support rating at 1%. Support for Reiwa Shinsengumi was 1%, compared to 2% in the last poll. Respondents who said they supported no political party stood at 39%, down 1 point since the preceding poll.

In a cellphone poll of 746 people, respondents were asked to name one political party that would be their choice for proportional representation seats in the next House of Representatives election. The responses are below, with percentages from the poll in June noted in parentheses.

"Southwest Japan village to discard 2,160 doses of COVID vaccine due to unplugged freezer","AKA, Fukuoka -- A village in southwest Japan announced on July 18 that it would discard 2,160 doses of COVID-19 vaccine designated for its residents as the storage freezer had been unplugged, causing inside temperatures to rise.

The population of the Fukuoka Prefecture village of Aka was 2,776, according to preliminary figures from the 2020 census. An official at the municipal government commented, ""As vaccine supplies are dwindling, this will likely affect our rollout plans. We will consult how to respond to the situation with the prefectural government.""

According to the village, the vaccine storage freezer apparently became unplugged for some reason during electrical work on the evening of July 16. The municipal government consequently canceled vaccination appointments for 174 people on July 17 and 306 on July 18, mainly among villagers aged under 65.","July 19, 2021",0,1
Smartphone app enables users to keep COVID-19 vaccination records,"TOKYO (Kyodo) -- A Tokyo-based medical venture has introduced a smartphone app feature enabling users to keep records of their COVID-19 vaccinations as many companies and universities have started administering doses to curb infections.

The new feature has been added to MinaCare Co.'s free vaccine and health monitoring app as it may become difficult for individuals to keep track of their inoculation history, especially when they receive shots at workplaces and schools without vaccination tickets issued by municipalities.

The Health Amulet app can automatically record the names of vaccine developers and manufacturers, while allowing users to insert information such as vaccine lot numbers, and their past and scheduled dates of inoculation.

The app reminds users of scheduled inoculation dates.

The Japanese company has tied up with U.S. pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc., enabling the app to provide the latest information about its vaccine.

MinaCare is also considering including the official certificates to be issued by municipalities as early as this month that will be used as so-called vaccine passports, it said.

Apart from COVID-19, users can store information about other vaccinations such as influenza shots.

MinaCare President Yuji Yamamoto, who is also a doctor, said, ""It is important for everyone to keep a record of when they received a shot"" of COVID-19 vaccine, as how long the vaccines will remain effective is unclear and it may become necessary to get shots on a regular basis.

""As some aspects of the vaccines are unknown as they have been developed with new technology, I want people to utilize the app to protect themselves for a long period of time,"" Yamamoto added.

So far, more than 40 organizations including companies and municipalities have agreed to introduce the app to staff and residents. They include Japan Airlines Co., the health insurance association of Seven & i Holdings Co. and the city of Fukuoka.

MinaCare has also tied up with Gurunavi Inc., which operates an online restaurant guide, to encourage employees of eateries to use the app.","July 18, 2021",1,3
Most major cities in Japan revise vaccine plans amid supply crunch,"TOKYO (Kyodo) -- Nearly 80% of 47 prefectural capitals in Japan said they either have changed or intend to change their plans to vaccinate their local residents against COVID-19 amid a supply shortage of vaccines, a Kyodo News survey showed Saturday.

Of the surveyed local governments, 37 said their revised plans include suspending, delaying or scaling back reservations by residents, as the central government's supplies of Pfizer Inc. vaccine are not able to meet the pace of their inoculations.

A total of 33 cities, or 70 percent, said the amount of doses allocated for July remains less than half the desired amount, with Fukui, Okayama and Nagasaki saying they are receiving only about 20 percent of what they had expected to procure, according to the survey.

Five city governments said they have pushed back or may delay the second round of vaccination, which usually takes place about three weeks after the first shot. The vaccine can remain effective for up to six weeks from the inoculation, according to the central government.

The survey result came as local governments have complained that they were encouraged by the administration of Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga to rapidly expand vaccination capacity, only to be told that supplies could not keep up.

Taro Kono, the minister in charge of vaccination efforts, said Thursday that Japan has secured sufficient Pfizer doses for about 1.2 million vaccinations per day through September, compared with the current pace of 1.5 million. He called on prefectures and municipalities to ""optimize"" their schedules accordingly.

COVID-19 vaccines developed by Moderna Inc. and AstraZeneca Plc have also been approved in Japan. The Moderna vaccine had been used in vaccination programs at workplaces but hit a supply bottleneck recently.

The government has yet to start supplying the AstraZeneca vaccine due to rare cases of blood clots among younger people but is considering recommending its use for people aged 60 or older, according to sources familiar with the matter.

Faced with criticism for its sluggish vaccine rollout, the Suga government has ramped up its vaccination program, with the aim of completing by November the inoculation of all eligible people who wish to get vaccinated.

Suga has said the number of people who have received their first shot is expected to reach 40 percent by the end of July. But the survey found only 11 cities expect to meet the goal.

The survey also showed that a total of 32 local governments, or 68 percent, said they expect the amount of doses to be allocated for August and September to be insufficient, as the supplies remain almost the same as July's level.","July 18, 2021",0,2
Local government left in lurch by Japan's erratic vaccine rollout,"Confusion regarding coronavirus vaccinations is spreading among municipal governments in Japan -- and the blame lies with the Japanese government, which sped up the rollout but miscalculated the balance between its supply of vaccines and demand from local governments. The central government must strengthen its collaboration with municipal governments and reorganize the system.

Officials say that enough vaccines for everyone in Japan who wants to be vaccinated will arrive by September, and that it will secure the necessary number of shots. But supplies of the Pfizer vaccine are not keeping up with demand as municipal authorities' ability to administer shots has improved.

Universities, companies and other entities have also applied in their droves for use of the Moderna vaccine, and large-scale vaccinations by local governments using the Moderna vaccine have only been able to fulfill requests from about half of those seeking vaccination. Supplies up until the end of June had been far below initial expectations, but the government only recently announced this was the case.

Some municipal authorities have been forced to cancel vaccination appointments and temporarily stop accepting reservations. The vaccine shortage is particularly noticeable in municipalities where the rollout had progressed swiftly.

Until now, municipal governments have had a fire lit under them by the central government to achieve Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga's target of administering 1 million shots a day. Despite them taking pains to recruit medical professionals and secure venues for vaccination, it appears local governments have been left hung out to dry.

There is also a gulf in perceptions regarding vaccine stocks. The central government maintains that local governments have a total of 40 million doses in storage, and that it intends to reduce supplies to authorities said to have high stocks by 10% from August.

In response, local governments have pushed back, saying they ""have no surplus,"" and, ""What we have isn't stock, but our supply of second shots.""

One cause of the divergence of views is that the government's vaccination record system is not fully functional. Registration takes times, and the state of vaccinations is not reflected in real time. It has also been pointed out that the system makes it hard to get any information on those who have been vaccinated outside where their home address is registered.

To stop the confusion dragging on further, the government should work to understand the situation, and expedite efforts to improve system operations.

The government is establishing a framework to supply vaccines in accordance with local governments' inoculation speeds. Prefectural governments will decide how the supplies are distributed, but clear criteria must be provided to prevent any new sense of unfairness emerging.

The Suga administration has positioned vaccines as their ace in the hole to fight COVID-19, but cooperation within the government has been lacking. It must properly fulfill its role as a central point of command.","July 17, 2021",0,1
Internet hoaxes fan COVID vaccine hesitancy among Japanese youths,"TOKYO (Kyodo) -- False claims and misinformation about vaccines on social media are undermining young people's trust in COVID-19 vaccines in Japan, imperiling the government's efforts to finish large-scale inoculations by November as it pursues herd immunity.

Myths such as ""vaccination causes infertility"" and ""coronavirus vaccines using messenger RNA change your DNA"" have been widely spread, and anti-vaccination posts are rampant on Facebook and Twitter.

""There is absolutely no scientific evidence that the coronavirus vaccines will cause infertility,"" Taro Kono, the minister in charge of Japan's inoculation effort, said on his blog last month.

He said ""vaccine hoaxes"" have been spreading around the world and Japan is no exception. He urged the public to be wary of disinformation.

The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists ""recommends that pregnant individuals have access to COVID-19 vaccines"" and that ""claims linking COVID-19 vaccines to infertility are unfounded and have no scientific evidence supporting them.""

The Japan Association of Obstetricians and Gynecologists as well as the Japan Society for Infectious Diseases in Obstetrics and Gynecology also say the advantages of COVID-19 vaccination outweigh the disadvantages for pregnant women. The Japanese health ministry says there have been no reports of coronavirus vaccines affecting reproductive functions.

Kono's blog is overseen by a group of some 30 doctors and experts who founded a project called ""COV-Navi"" with an aim of providing comprehensible information on the efficacy and side effects of coronavirus vaccines.

""In the past few weeks, we have been receiving a lot of questions from people regarding false information about vaccines,"" said Tomoya Kurokawa, a doctor at Chiba University Hospital who also administers COV-Navi.

When vaccinations started at workplaces and universities in late June, more people looked up vaccination information online and came across hoaxes that fueled anxiety, Kurokawa said.

""Many young people are hesitant toward getting vaccinated because they think they will not fall seriously ill from COVID-19, thinking there's no point of inoculation,"" Kurokawa said, but warned the disease could cause long-term effects for people of all ages.

In a recent survey by Kyushu Bunka Gakuen, which operates private schools and universities in southwestern Japan prefecture of Nagasaki, a total of 388, or 45.9 percent, of the 846 high school students consulted said they would be vaccinated ""if it is compulsory.""

Meanwhile, 110 students, or 13.0 percent, said they would prefer not to get vaccinated.

The survey, conducted in early June, also showed 137 students, or 16.2 percent, said they would get inoculated while 34, or 4.1 percent, responded they would ""never"" get vaccinated.

Among the reasons for not wanting the vaccination, 59.1 percent of those who were against getting a shot cited ""a fear of side effects,"" followed by ""questionable"" effectiveness of vaccines at 13.4 percent.

A spokesman for the school said, ""Perhaps, conflicting information from the internet and people around (the students) is increasing their sense of insecurity (about vaccination).""

The governor of Tokyo, where a fresh state of emergency has been recently been declared and the highest cumulative number of coronavirus cases has been reported in Japan, also expressed concerns.

Tokyo Gov. Yuriko Koike said in a regular press conference last week both correct and incorrect information has been circulating on social media and that ""the diffusion of the correct knowledge about vaccines"" is necessary among young people to speed up the inoculation program.

Japan has recently been accelerating its vaccine rollout, extending the program to younger people after starting with health care workers and people aged 65 or older.

In a separate survey of about 11,800 people by a state-backed institute, 80.6 percent of the respondents aged 65 or older said they plan to get inoculated, while about 17.5 percent of those aged between 18 and 29 said they plan not to get vaccinated, according to the Research Institute of Economy, Trade and Industry.

The survey, which was conducted over three periods from October 2020 with the latest round carried finishing in May this year, showed that younger age groups are tending to be less open to vaccination.

""Promoting vaccination across all generations will require finding ways to motivate younger people to get vaccinated,"" RIETI researchers wrote.

Chiba University Hospital's Kurokawa said, ""It is important to make a decision on whether to get vaccinated after having understood the correct information about vaccines.""

""I'm not saying there is zero risk associated with the coronavirus vaccines, just like any other vaccines or medications, but the benefits of vaccination outweigh the risks,"" he said.","July 16, 2021",0,1
Japan's vaccine czar pumps brakes amid supply crunch,"TOKYO (Kyodo) -- Local governments in Japan need to slow down in administering COVID-19 vaccine to residents as supply is expected to remain limited in the coming months, the minister in charge of vaccination efforts said Thursday.

Taro Kono said Japan has secured sufficient Pfizer Inc. doses for about 1.2 million vaccinations per day through September, and called on prefectures and municipalities to ""optimize"" their schedules accordingly.

The request comes as local governments have complained that they were encouraged by the administration of Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga to rapidly expand vaccination capacity, only to be told that supply would not keep up.

Kono said Japan is still set to secure enough doses by September to fully vaccinate everyone in its population who is eligible and wishes to be inoculated, while apologizing for local governments being forced to suspend or delay reservations by residents due to the vaccine shortage.

""I'm sorry, but please wait a little longer,"" he said at an event in Tokyo organized by Kyodo News.

Japan expects to receive 70 million doses of the Pfizer vaccine from July through September, with an additional 40 million doses already delivered to local governments and still unused.

The total, divided by the number of days through September, comes to 1.2 million vaccinations per day, down from the current pace of 1.5 million, Kono said.

Kono, who is the minister for administrative reform and took on the vaccination job in January, said he had initially expected about 700,000 to 800,000 shots to be administered daily and was teased by Suga during a recent briefing for what turned out to be a very modest estimate.

After a sluggish start compared to other wealthy nations such as the United States and Britain, Japan has quickly ramped up its vaccination program with 19.7 percent of its population fully inoculated against COVID-19 as of Wednesday.

But Kono last month halted applications for companies to administer the Moderna Inc. vaccine to employees, saying he could not ensure that the necessary doses would be distributed quickly enough.

Local bodies with 'no leftover vaccines' upset by Japan government plan to cut supplies,"Opposition has been voiced among some municipalities in Japan, including the major cities of Sapporo, Nagoya and Osaka, over the government's plan to reduce their COVID-19 vaccine supplies on the grounds that they have sufficient stocks -- a claim they dispute.

Under the plan for the first half of August disclosed by the Japanese government, the reduced amount will go to a stockpile handled by prefectural governments which can allocate the supplies to municipalities at their discretion.

The city of Sapporo claimed it does not hold ""excessive stocks,"" while Nagoya Mayor Takashi Kawamura expressed discontent with a 10% reduction in the city's basic vaccine supplies, allocated based on population, for the first half of August. He told reporters on July 13, ""We don't have any leftover vaccines. The national government needs to handle this properly.""

Although the central Japan city of Nagoya was set to receive 160,290 vaccine doses as basic supplies, the amount indicated by the national government's distribution plan was 145,080 doses. The municipal government argued that its move of securing supplies while taking into account the second round of vaccinations ""made it seem that stocks had increased.""

The Japanese government has defined ""stocks"" as supplies of vaccines yet to be administered that will last over six weeks, when making calculations using the average number of shots given recently. The Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare said it ""considered the reality in the field"" for making the decision, but the Nagoya Municipal Government protested against the ministry, saying it cannot consent to this. The city intends to seek additional supplies distributed at the prefecture's discretion.

The city of Sapporo in Japan's northernmost prefecture of Hokkaido also announced in a July 13 press conference that it will temporarily suspend vaccine delivery to medical institutions between July 16 and 25, in response to the decrease in supplies. It also plans to ask some of the individuals who have already made reservations to change or cancel their vaccination appointments. In addition to securing vaccines for the second round of inoculations, delays in making entries in the national government's vaccination record system seem to have been factors that influenced the decision to reduce supplies for certain municipalities.

Meanwhile, the handling of supplies to be allocated to municipalities at the discretion of prefectures, which is to be decided this week, is another point of focus moving forward. While there has been a significant difference in inoculation speed depending on local bodies, this distribution system was introduced out of hope for measures to be taken befitting the situation of each area.

Osaka Gov. Hirofumi Yoshimura revealed July 13 that the prefecture intends to allocate half of the vaccine supplies left to their discretion to municipalities based on the numbers of new infections amid the fourth coronavirus wave. He explained, ""If the amount is limited, we should distribute them to the places (city areas) where outbreaks (of infection) are liable to occur."" He also said that the remaining half of supplies allocated to the prefecture will be distributed based on population, and asked for the understanding of residents in non-urban areas.","July 14, 2021",0,1
