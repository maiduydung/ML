Except for the honor, prestige and substantial prize money the recipient also gets a gold medal showing Alfred Nobel (1833 - 1896) who established the prize. Every year it's given to scientists and scholars in the categories chemistry, literature, physics, physiology or medicine, economics, and peace. The first Nobel Prize was handed out in 1901, and at that time the Prize was very Eurocentric and male-focused, but nowadays it's not biased in any way whatsoever. Surely. Right?</p>\n<p>Well, we're going to find out! The Nobel Foundation has made a dataset available of all prize winners from the start of the prize, in 1901, to 2016. Let's load it in and take a look.</p>"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"dc":{"key":"3"},"tags":["sample_code"]},"outputs":[{"metadata":{},"execution_count":122,"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/html":"<div>\n<style
