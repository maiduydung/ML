0,"Metal substance tainted Moderna jabs, dealing setback to rollout",['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"August 27, 2021 at 17:55 JST"," The foreign substance found in Moderna's COVID-19 vaccines is a metallic substance, the health ministry announced on Aug. 26. “It is metal and reacts to a magnet, and it likely fell into (the vaccines) in the manufacturing process,” a senior ministry official said. The ministry said the contaminant was found in a total of 390 doses, which were scheduled to be used at eight vaccination centers in Tokyo and Saitama, Aichi, Ibaraki and Gifu prefectures. Staff detected tainted vials and removed them from the lineup for use, the ministry said. The health ministry said there have not been any reports that a tainted jab was administered to someone or any reports of safety concerns as of Aug. 26. But the ministry said there are about 1.6 million doses of Moderna vaccines that may have also been tainted because they were manufactured on the same production line. These vaccines have been distributed at 863 vaccination sites around the country and some have already been administered to people. The ministry said it does not know how many people have received doses from these 1.6 million. But at least 946 people, including 94 lawmakers, have received a possibly tainted Moderna jab. They were used at a workplace inoculation program operated by the Diet, which started on Aug. 16. The Defense Ministry announced that 70,000 doses of possibly tainted Moderna jabs were administered at the Osaka International Convention Center, which is a makeshift large-scale vaccination center run by the Self-Defense Forces in Osaka’s Kita Ward, during the period from Aug. 6 to 20. Chief Cabinet Secretary Katsunobu Kato urged members of the public who have received the vaccine to be on the watch for possible health problems. “If you have felt that something is wrong, please consult your primary physician,” he said at a news conference. The Asahi Shimbun One way to know if an individual has indeed received a Moderna dose that was possibly tainted is to check their COVID-19 vaccination certificate, which typically comes in the form of a sticker received after each vaccination. The certificate shows the lot number the administered vaccine came from, along with the name of the manufacturer. The ministry said the tainted 390 doses share the lot number 3004667. About 570,000 doses with that lot number were imported to Japan. The ministry also released two lot numbers that may have possibly also produced tainted vaccines: 3004734, which contained about 520,000 doses, and 3004956, which had about 540,000 doses. The health ministry has ordered affected vaccination centers to stop administering vaccines from the stock of these 1.6 million doses. Takeda Pharmaceutical Co., which imports and sells Moderna vaccines, is urging personnel involved in vaccinations to check each vial carefully, regardless of its lot number. Even if a vial is not on the ministry’s “do not use” list, staffers should “visually check before use for any abnormality, such as a mixed-in foreign substance,” the company said. CANCELLATIONS AND FRUSTRATIONS Moderna’s COVID-19 vaccines have mostly been used at mass inoculation programs operated by large companies, universities and local governments, among other organizations. The latest revelation has thrown operators of such sites around the country into a mad scramble to deal with the sudden halt of scheduled inoculation programs. For some, it was not the first time they had to cope with a sudden change of schedule, as the supply of Moderna vaccines has often been insufficient and has at times fluctuated. A chamber of commerce and industry in Yamaguchi Prefecture was ready to finally launch an organization-wide vaccination program on Aug. 26. But after the health ministry announced the stoppage earlier that day, the chamber canceled it. Inoculation of its members was initially scheduled to start a month ago, but it was pushed back. The latest announcement forced the chamber to brace for yet another delay of the plan. The Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry has urged the central government to provide information about vaccine safety and the steadiness of supply, and has also requested that replacement vaccines be sent to affected local chambers. The Okinawa Prefectural government scrapped a scheduled inoculation of 500 or so people at the Okinawa Convention Center in Ginowan and stopped taking new appointments. The prefectural government is planning to resume the operation as of Aug. 27 by providing replacement vaccines, but officials said the unforeseeable circumstances have made the situation unclear. Okinawa officials also revealed that possibly tainted vaccines were administered to 1,480 people at the convention center during the period from Aug. 20 to 25. But there have been no reports of any health concerns arising from it. The Iwate prefectural government also announced that 2,477 doses of possibly tainted vaccine were administered at mass vaccination centers run by municipal governments and workplace-related vaccination programs. News of the recall due to the tainted doses has thrown a wrench into the plans of many other organizations as well. All Nippon Airways Co. canceled its company-wide vaccination program scheduled at Haneda Airport in Tokyo on Aug. 26 and 27. The company said about 4,700 doses of possibly tainted vaccines had already been administered. But an ANA representative added, “We have nurses who check each (vial), and no intermixture has been detected.” The University of Tokyo has temporarily stopped accepting new appointments for its own vaccination program, while continuing vaccinations as of Aug. 26 as planned. Scheduled vaccinations at the International University of Health and Welfare’s Akasaka campus, Tokai University’s Shonan campus and Okayama University have also been frozen. SUGA: ‘NO MAJOR IMPACT’ Despite all the confusion and frustration, the central government insists this latest mishap will not cause delays in the nation’s already lagging vaccination rollout. “I have been told that it will not have a major impact on inoculations,” Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga told reporters on Aug. 26. The health ministry said replacements for the 1.6 million doses in question will be sent to affected sites to prevent further delays. But a senior official from the prime minister’s office admitted that it will deal a blow to progress in its vaccine rollout efforts. “Vaccination at (these) sites has been halted for now. So, it will likely have an impact.” ROVI, a pharmaceutical company in Spain that manufactures the Moderna vaccine that has been imported to and used in Japan, said in a statement dated Aug. 26 that it is currently investigating the matter. “The detection of this particulate matter refers to certain vials of one product lot distributed exclusively to Japan,” the company said. The origin of the incident “may be in one of its manufacturing lines,” it said, but “as a precaution, this lot and two adjacent lots have been put on hold.” The company said it, Moderna and Takeda are all working closely with Japanese health authorities “to clarify and solve, if applicable, this incident.”",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14427323
0,Demand among youths outstrips supply at vaccine site in Shibuya,['By KEITA YAMAGUCHI/ Staff Writer'],"August 27, 2021 at 17:45 JST"," Young people standing in a long line is a common sight in Tokyo's Shibuya Ward, but this time they weren't waiting to buy concert tickets or a trendy new beverage. Instead, they were waiting at a special COVID-19 vaccination center set up for young people by the Tokyo metropolitan government on Aug. 27. No reservation was required for a vaccination at Shibuya Ward’s labor welfare hall . However, as a long line formed from the early morning, even though the center would not open until noon, staff were forced to hand tickets out for admittance. The metropolitan government announced on the Twitter at 7:30 a.m. that it stopped taking vaccination requests at the Shibuya center for the day. The announcement said that all slots were filled and that they apologized to people who were planning to come there. But even after that, a string of young people continued to visit the center, and the Tokyo officials were forced to explain to them that they had finished accepting requests for the day. According to the metropolitan government, it initially anticipated that about 200 people would receive shots of the Pfizer vaccine per day. But on that day, more young people came to the venue than expected. A 28-year-old man, who lives in Kashiwa, Chiba Prefecture, and commutes to Tokyo’s Chiyoda Ward for his job, took the earliest train and arrived at the vaccination venue a little after 7 a.m. At first, he was worried because of the long line but he was able to obtain a ticket. “I realized that many people in the same generation want to get jabs to feel safe,” he said. “I feel sorry for people who lined up behind me and were turned away. The vaccination center should provide more slots.” The metropolitan government plans to adopt a lottery system for the next vaccination day at the center on Aug. 28 and later dates. The vaccinations will be offered at the labor welfare hall every day by Oct. 8, excluding Mondays, Sept. 12 and Oct. 3. People aged from 16 to 39 who live in Tokyo or come to the capital for their job or schooling are eligible for the jabs. They need to bring their vaccination vouchers and identification cards.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14427453
0,High numbers of undetected virus cases feared as testing falls short,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"August 27, 2021 at 16:50 JST"," There could be “ numerous (unreported) COVID-19 patients” out in public because of the lack of available tests, as foot traffic increased in the capital, experts warned on Aug. 26. The Tokyo metropolitan government’s expert panel on response to the COVID-19 health crisis reported that foot traffic in entertainment and shopping areas in the capital, currently under a state of emergency, increased sharply after the Bon summer holidays. Pedestrian traffic as of the middle of August decreased 29.1 percent from the week prior to the fourth state of emergency, declared on July 12, while the same volume for the week through Aug. 25 dropped only 16.5 percent. The Tokyo metropolitan government has set a 50 percent goal in reduction of foot traffic, but the level is returning to the one seen prior to the state of emergency without the number of new COVID-19 patients dropping sufficiently. The expert panel reported that the daily average of new novel coronavirus cases for the week through Aug. 25 was 4,388, 95 percent of the figure for the preceding week. The positivity rate, however, remained high at 20.7 percent. Experts pointed out the possibility of numerous infections among the population that have not been detected due to the lack of available testing. Foot traffic was recorded for visitors in seven entertainment and shopping areas, including Shinjuku’s Kabukicho and Shibuya. During the daytime between noon and 6 p.m. foot traffic in the areas decreased only 13.3 percent compared to the week prior to the emergency declaration. During late night between 10 p.m. and midnight, considered to be a high-risk period for infections, it also dropped only 14.7 percent. In comparison, foot traffic for the week through Aug. 14 fell 24.7 percent during the daytime while it fell 36.4 percent during the late-night hours. The panel also reported that older adults between 40 and 64 accounted for a higher percentage of the foot traffic than those between ages 15 and 39 during all time frames. Atsushi Nishida, director of the Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Medical Science, who researched foot traffic patterns in the capital, urged those middle-aged and senior citizens to avoid nonessential outings. “The high-risk actions of the middle-aged and senior citizens could threaten their lives and also trigger infections among their families and workplaces,” he said.

Pre-emergency measures will be additionally placed on Kochi, Saga, Nagasaki and Miyazaki prefectures. The expansion of the state of emergency and pre-emergency measures will be applied from Aug. 27 to Sept. 12. A total of 21 of Japan's 47 prefectures will be covered under the state of emergency once the change takes effect, and 12 will be covered under pre-emergency measures. “(I) have begun to clearly see light (at the end of the tunnel),"" Suga said during a news conference. ""I will decide whether to extend the declaration ending on Sept. 12 by analyzing the COVID-19 vaccination progress, the number of patients with serious conditions, the bed occupancy rate and other factors.” Suga also raised the prospect of vaccine passports as part of Japan's path back to normalcy. “We will consider regaining our daily lives and social-economic activities, such as going to eating and drinking establishments, and events, and taking trips, by using vaccine passports actively,” he said. Shigeru Omi, chief of the government’s expert panel on the response to the COVID-19 health crisis, also attended the news conference. Commenting on the timing for lifting the state of emergency, he said, “The most important thing is how much the strain in the medical care system will be alleviated.” Suga declared that he will decide to use a reserve fund of 1.4 trillion yen ($12.73 billion) for countermeasures against the new coronavirus within this week. “We will respond to urgent tasks, such as the vaccination efforts and procurement of neutralizing antibody drugs.” Suga also spoke about measures to prevent children from getting infected. “The central government won’t ask all schools in Japan to close down at the same time,” he said. But he also said that he will present guidelines swiftly to allow schools and municipal governments to properly decide on whether to suspend schools when infections occurred there. Omi, at the Lower House’s Committee on Health, Labor and Welfare on Aug. 25, said, “Each municipal government should decide whether to postpone to some extent the date when schools will start after the summer break.” The expert panel on the same day recommended that related authorities hand out simplified antigen test kits to kindergartens, elementary and junior high schools from early September.

0,1.6 million jabs halted after tainted Moderna doses discovered,['By KAI ICHINO/ Staff Writer'],"August 26, 2021 at 15:20 JST"," About 1.6 million scheduled jabs of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine have been canceled after contaminants were discovered in some of the vials. The health ministry announced on Aug. 26 that contaminated doses were detected and reported at multiple vaccination sites. It confirmed at least 390 doses of the Moderna vaccine had become contaminated with a foreign substance. The tainted vaccines were initially scheduled for use at eight large-scale vaccination sites in Tokyo and four prefectures: Saitama, Aichi, Ibaraki and Gifu. But officials have halted their use. There have not been any reported safety concerns as of now, the ministry added. The ministry has halted the use of 1.6 million doses of Moderna vaccines manufactured through the same processes as the vaccines that were confirmed tainted. It is unknown how many people have received a dose out of these 1.6 million, distributed to 863 sites nationwide, according to the ministry. The vaccines in question were manufactured in Spain, and Moderna is investigating the makeup of the contaminants. A piece of rubber was reportedly found in other manufacturers’ vaccines, the ministry said. In the process of attaching a rubber stopper to the vial, a piece of rubber can sometimes get through and end up in the vial, it added. Starting from mid-August, inoculators at multiple vaccination sites noticed contamination of Moderna vaccines. They reported the matter to Takeda Pharmaceutical Co., which imports and sells Moderna vaccines. The ministry learned about the problem on Aug. 25. All the Moderna vaccines used in Japan are manufactured by the same company based in Spain, the ministry said. The company conducted large-scale maintenance work and changed its manufacturing process, the ministry said. If the foreign substance turns out to be bits of rubber, the risk of the rubber clogging a person’s blood vessels is low because the vaccine is injected into muscle, the ministry said. But if people who got the vaccine develop concerning symptoms, they should call a health care organization immediately, the ministry said.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14426321

Health care workers began administering the AstraZeneca vaccine to people on Aug. 23 at Shiromi Hall inside Osaka-jo Hall in the city’s Chuo Ward. The campaign is targeting city residents aged 40 or older. But those aged between 18 and 39 are also eligible under certain conditions, according to city officials. Those include if the person is unable to receive doses of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines because of allergies, or if they have already been given their first shot of the AstraZeneca vaccine abroad. Every Monday, the city’s website and call centers will accept AstraZeneca vaccination reservations for the following week. The central government has supplied the AstraZeneca vaccine to Tokyo as well as Saitama, Chiba, Kanagawa, Osaka and Okinawa prefectures, which have been under a state of emergency, ahead of other regions. It had shipped all the doses for the six prefectures as of Aug. 16, according to the health ministry. The government was initially planning to authorize AstraZeneca only for people aged 60 or older. But it did an about-face after the National Governors’ Association, the ruling Liberal Democratic Party and government officials called for it to be used more widely because of a shortage of Pfizer and Moderna shipments. The government had secured millions of AstraZeneca doses, but they had not been used in Japan due to concerns over rare blood clots reported in people who have received the shots.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14424014
0,COVID-19 testing failing to catch up to speed of coronavirus,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"August 23, 2021 at 18:02 JST"," The positivity rate for COVID-19 tests has risen in many parts of the country, raising concerns that testing is falling behind the pace at which the coronavirus is spreading. A central government panel has defined the most serious infection situation, stage four, as when the positivity rate reaches 10 percent or more, and stage three at 5 percent or more. As of Aug. 19, the Cabinet Secretariat’s official figure for Tokyo’s positivity rate over the latest week was high: 23.3 percent. It was 34.8 percent in Kanagawa Prefecture, while the national average was 16.4 percent. During an Aug. 20 meeting, Tokyo metropolitan government officials pointed to a failure of conducting tests quickly enough on those who need to be tested. But Tokyo has yet to reach the limit of its capacity for administering tests. What the government refers to as “administrative testing” is available at public expense for those with COVID-19 symptoms or who have been exposed to the virus. As of Aug. 20, 14,000 people on average received an administrative test in Tokyo per day in the last seven days. But according to the metropolitan government, more than 40,000 administrative tests a day can be conducted at about 3,800 health care organizations in the capital. A metropolitan government official denied that Tokyo has scaled back its testing efforts. The low number reflects “the number of patients who go to a health care organization that conducts administrative testing,” the official said. One of the major reasons why the number of administrative tests has grown at such a sluggish pace is because a massive epidemiological study being carried out at public health centers is running behind. The research aims to identify infected people as soon as possible to prevent the virus from spreading quickly. In the study, public health center representatives interview infected people about their recent history, identify people who have been in close contact with them and then test those close contacts. Many of those in close contact with infected individuals are not infected themselves. When the study is being conducted widely, it contributes to an increase in testing and a lower positivity rate. But when the number of infected people increases to a certain point, the study has less of an impact on the numbers. Another reason is that public health centers are preoccupied with many important tasks other than testing, such as finding hospitals to transport patients and monitoring patients’ health conditions. On top of all that, not everyone exhibiting COVID-19 symptoms wants to get tested. The Asahi Shimbun “Last year, there were many people who wanted to take a test even though they had minor symptoms. But not now,” said Fujiki Ishihara, director of the Kitashinagawa Fuji Clinic in Tokyo’s Shinagawa Ward. At the same time, private companies that conduct “self-pay testing” have stepped up their presence. This kind of testing targets people who do not have symptoms and are less likely to have contracted the virus. A subsidiary of the Tokyo-based Kinoshita Group has conducted self-financed tests at 15 locations, including three airports. It can run about 15,000 tests per day. Appointments for tests have been fully booked every day at least as far back as the four-day holiday weekend in July. The positivity rate until early July was about 1.3 percent. But it rose to around 3 percent at the end of the month. The health ministry in July started releasing the number of self-pay tests provided by certain private-testing companies. According to data released on Aug. 22, there were about 1.71 million private tests conducted in the span of about a month up until Aug. 14. During the same period, about 2.55 million administrative tests were conducted. But the positivity rate released by the health ministry and other administrative agencies does not include self-pay tests. In areas where many private tests are conducted, the positivity rates may have become higher than they are in actuality.

0,18 at-home COVID-19 deaths in Tokyo area since July,[],"August 22, 2021 at 17:01 JST"," At least 18 COVID-19 patients have died at home in the Tokyo metropolitan area since July due to a lack of available hospital beds, an Asahi Shimbun study found. The deaths serve as a fresh reminder of the urgency of securing ways to promptly provide care to patients at home whose condition suddenly deteriorates. In Tokyo and its neighboring prefectures of Kanagawa, Saitama and Chiba, there were three such incidences in July, according to the study. The number jumped to 15 in August. Half of the 18 fatalities were patients in their 50s or younger, the study showed. As Japan grapples with its fifth and largest wave of novel coronavirus infections, 96,857 patients nationwide were recuperating at home as of Aug. 18 without access to hospital care. This is because public health centers initially assessed that their symptoms were not sufficiently serious to warrant hospitalization. On July 7, the figure stood at 4,001. Since then, it has jumped 24-fold. It is not uncommon among patients with COVID-19 for their health condition to abruptly deteriorate to the point they need emergency treatment at a medical center. Public health centers are in charge of determining which patients should be hospitalized and finding hospital beds for them. But a surge in caseloads has made it increasingly difficult for medical centers to admit patients who potentially may develop grave health issues. For the study, the Asahi contacted authorities in Tokyo and the three prefectures, as well as Osaka and Okinawa prefectures, to ascertain the number of patients who died while staying home while fighting the disease. All the prefectures are under a state of emergency. Patients found dead at home or who died after being rushed to a hospital following a rapid worsening of their condition were counted in the study. In Tokyo, there were nine such deaths, one in July and eight in August. Of those, six patients were in their 50s or younger, including a man in his 30s with no underlying health problems. In Kanagawa Prefecture, a man in his 60s and another in his 40s died in July. This month, a woman in her 60s died. In Saitama Prefecture, three men--one in his 40s, one in his 50s and another in his 70s--died while recuperating at home in August. The infection of the man in his 50s was confirmed on Aug. 10. He had a pre-existing health condition. But he was recuperating at home as his symptoms were assessed as mild. He was found dead on the morning of Aug. 15. Three patients, two men in their 60s and a woman in her 80s, died in Chiba Prefecture this month. The woman contracted the virus in late July and stayed home because she reportedly showed no symptoms. Prefectural officials began searching for a hospital bed for her after her blood oxygen saturation level plunged to below 90 percent on the evening of Aug. 10. The normal level is 96 percent or more. Her death was confirmed that night. No hospital bed had been found for her. Osaka and Okinawa prefectures replied that no patients staying home have died since July. In the case of Osaka Prefecture, there were 19 such deaths between March 1 and June 20 during the fourth wave of infections. According to the health ministry, 84 COVID-19 patients died at home nationwide in the first half of this year. Of the total, 71 were in their 60s or older.

0,Chiba hospital secures beds for pregnant COVID-19 patients,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"August 20, 2021 at 18:00 JST"," A Chiba hospital has designated beds to accept pregnant COVID-19 patients following the death of a newborn after a novel coronavirus patient was unable to find a hospital that would admit her and gave birth at home. Chiba University Hospital will secure some of six beds in its maternal fetal intensive care unit at the perinatal medical center for expectant mothers with COVID-19. The MFICU is a treatment facility where patients at high risk can be hospitalized during their pregnancy, birth and postpartum care. It treats such patients and pre-born and newborn children around the clock. According to the hospital, after the COVID-19 patient’s baby died, doctors talked about the clinic’s examination system and the hospital’s procurement of beds at an online meeting on Aug. 18. The hospital decided to create the beds because its emergency system accepts critical pregnant women without any preconditions. “All the beds for COVID-19 patients have already been occupied, and there is no room for accepting pregnant COVID-19 patients,"" said Makio Shozu, a professor at Chiba University’s Graduate School of Medicine, who specializes in reproductive medicine. "" Our hospital ward, therefore, has to accept them."" “It is very difficult to respond to a childbirth while we prevent the virus from spreading, but we have to do this to allow such a patient to safely give birth,” he added. PERINATAL CARE BEDS IN SHORT SUPPLY As more pregnant women have been infected with the novel coronavirus in the Tokyo metropolitan area, there are not enough hospital beds to accommodate them. “It takes longer to coordinate the childbirth of pregnant COVID-19 patients,” said Kei Kawana, a chief professor of gynecology and obstetrics at Nihon University Itabashi Hospital in Tokyo. “Please talk to your primary care doctors as early as possible.” He said that his hospital has 50 beds or more for COVID-19 patients and has been accepting such patients who were pregnant and were refused by other medical institutions, but that it is getting more difficult to accept them. “The perinatal care system has started to collapse in some areas,” Kawana said. The Japan Society of Obstetrics and Gynecology and other groups asked medical institutions across Japan to boost their medical capacity for such patients on Aug. 10. A health ministry study team recently surveyed 144 pregnant COVID-19 patients in Japan and found that they tended to be at higher risk of developing serious symptoms after their 25 th week of pregnancy. When the uterus expands, it puts pressure on the diaphragm, making it harder for the expectant mother to breathe. If pregnant women get infected with the novel coronavirus, their breathing condition could worsen quickly. The JSOG released a statement on Aug. 14 urging pregnant women to get a COVID-19 vaccination regardless of their pregnancy stage to prevent them from developing serious symptoms. “We have not found any evidence as of now that the vaccine could cause a miscarriage or affect a fetus,” said Toshibumi Taniguchi, an instructor of infectious diseases at Chiba University. “Even if you are pregnant, please get vaccinated when it is your turn.” (This article was written by Noriyuki Shigemasa, Mirei Jinguji and Kazuya Goto.)",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14421997
0,Hospital rejects Paralympic request to offer emergency care,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"August 20, 2021 at 17:03 JST"," A hospital designated to treat injured or ill Paralympic-related people rejected a request from the Games organizer to also provide emergency care for serious cases, saying it is already too busy with COVID-19 patients. “It’s unthinkable to accept such a request when a response at the level of a natural disaster is required to contain the spread of the virus,” said Yuichi Hamabe, who heads the Tertiary Emergency Medical Center of the Tokyo Metropolitan Bokutoh Hospital in the capital’s Sumida Ward. According to the hospital, it signed an agreement with the Paralympic organizing committee to accept Games-related people, excluding athletes, who are injured or become sick during the event within the framework of general medical services. The organizing committee on Aug. 12 asked the Tertiary Emergency Medical Center to also take in emergency patients who are severely injured or fall seriously ill at competition venues. But the center turned down the request because it is a medical institution designated to treat infectious diseases, including COVID-19, and its medical services are already severely strained by the “explosive growth” in novel coronavirus infections. “The organizing committee made the request just before the Paralympics kick off,” Hamabe said. “That shows it doesn’t think Games can be held safely. Concerned parties should quickly discuss whether to go ahead with the Paralympics.” Other medical institutions designated to accept injured or ill Paralympic-related people during the Games also said they cannot provide additional emergency services. A senior official of one such hospital in the greater Tokyo metropolitan area said those medical institutions cannot give special treatment to the Paralympics because they serve as base hospitals in each region and are responsible for providing medical services to local residents. The organizing committee told The Asahi Shimbun in writing that it is asking designated hospitals to accept patients if medical offices at competition venues cannot deal with the cases.

0,"New guidelines eyed for issuing, ending state of emergency",['By KEISHI NISHIMURA/ Staff Writer'],"August 20, 2021 at 13:40 JST"," The government is considering changing its guidelines for declaring and lifting a COVID-19 state of emergency by placing more emphasis on the medical care structure instead of infection numbers, sources said. The possible shift would be aimed at ensuring health care systems do not become overstrained, a problem facing many local governments in the latest surge of the novel coronavirus, they said. When Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga announced an expansion of the state of emergency at his Aug. 17 news conference, he explained that the emergency declaration would be lifted based on the state of the medical care structure. That indicates future attention would be focused on the number of patients with serious symptoms and the ratio of hospital-bed usage by such patients. Shigeru Omi, chairman of the government panel of experts who accompanied Suga at the news conference, said a fundamental point in coming up with an exit strategy would be focusing on the medical care structure, including the number of patients with serious symptoms and the number who are hospitalized. The government currently uses five guidelines in deciding on declaring and lifting the state of emergency. The number of new COVID-19 cases has been considered the leading indicator. An increase in that figure was believed to lead to a rise in the number of those with serious symptoms, putting greater pressure on the medical care structure. Currently, the number of new COVID-19 cases over a week per 100,000 residents has been the main guideline used to declare a state of emergency. A prefecture with 25 or more cases per 100,000 people is considered at the most serious stage 4, where an “explosive growth” in infections is occurring. But in Tokyo, the figure as of Aug. 18 was 236, or close to 10 times the cutoff point for stage 4. “If we keep the guidelines unchanged, there will be no way to lift the state of emergency in the near future,” a Cabinet minister said. Some officials also said new guidelines are needed because the increasing number of people who are vaccinated would decrease the risk of patients developing serious symptoms. However, other government officials voiced skepticism about the possible change, noting that unlike influenza, there are few drugs that can be used to treat COVID-19 patients. A bureaucrat dealing with the pandemic also said criticism would arise from the public if the guidelines were reviewed to make it easier to lift the state of emergency. At his Aug. 17 news conference, Yasutoshi Nishimura, the state minister in charge of economic revitalization who also heads the central government’s efforts against the pandemic, said he would ask experts to consider whether different guidelines or other reference points were needed to make decisions about a state of emergency. He said that as more people are vaccinated, having more than 25 infected people per 100,000 residents over a week may no longer be considered a major problem. Nishimura also indicated that other factors would have to be taken into consideration when reviewing the guidelines, including rate of vaccinations among those in their 40s and 50s, who are now most vulnerable to developing serious symptoms, as well as the hospitalization rate and the number of those with serious symptoms.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14421871

The owners of traditional Japanese-style restaurants here think they have found a way. They teamed up to create a certification system to promote restaurants taking thorough measures against the risk of infections to woo back customers. The new system is called “Chef’s Criteria of New Normal,” a name chosen to emphasize that they are setting the highest safety standards for the entire Japanese restaurant industry to adjust to the challenging times. It will be put into operation in September. “Kyoto is the center of Japanese cuisine,” Yoshihiro Murata, 69, president of three-star Michelin restaurant Kikunoi, told a news conference on July 27. “When Kyoto goes into action, it becomes widespread, creating a big movement.” To become certified, restaurants need to meet 100 standards, covering anti-infection measures for private rooms, hygiene-control procedures in kitchens and other actions. Many of the standards are based on numerical guidelines, such as the number of customers based on appropriate calculations and the amount of air required for proper ventilation for each space. The logo of the Chef’s Criteria of New Normal certification system (Provided by the preparatory committee for the Anshin no Shoku Project　certification system) The certification was developed by a committee made up of the owners of 16 established restaurants, including Hyotei, another three-star Michelin restaurant, the 480-year-old Nakamuraro, Kinobu and Minokichi. Armed with subsidies of about 5 million yen ($45,300) from the prefectural government, the restaurateurs spent a year and more than 10 million yen coming up with the new system, a process that included consultations with experts. The certification is issued by a third-party organization after it conducts an on-site survey to ensure the standards are being met. The prefectural government on July 19 announced its own certification system, which hands out stickers to restaurants that meet its 38-point guidelines. But the Chef’s Criteria of New Normal regime is stricter, covering more than twice as many standards. “This system is much stricter than ours because it also involves standards for food hygiene and compliance,” Kyoto Governor Takatoshi Nishiwaki said. “It is an effort aimed not only at preventing infections but also at shaping the future of food culture that will support Kyoto for generations to come.”",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14413954

Asked about the newborn’s death, Chief Cabinet Secretary Katsunobu Kato said at a news conference on Aug. 19 that the government is asking prefectural governments to build a system to swiftly accept COVID-19 patients into hospitals. “We will urge them again to take concrete measures on reinforcing the patient transport and hospitalization systems,” he said. “The government will offer necessary support.” (This article was written by Yuta Ogi and Takefumi Ishihara.)",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14421133
0,40 prefectures now at ‘explosive growth’ in new virus infections,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"August 19, 2021 at 16:15 JST"," Forty of Japan’s 47 prefectures are now in the most serious Stage 4 level of “explosive growth” in novel coronavirus infections. The number, based on daily COVID-19 case counts over the week to Aug. 17, was up from 31 prefectures in the previous week. The number of new cases across Japan for the latest week was 131 percent of the figure for the week earlier. Only Fukui and Tottori prefectures have seen decreases in new infections over that period. “The spread of infections never ends,” a member of the health ministry’s advisory panel on COVID-19 countermeasures said at an Aug. 18 meeting. The National Institute of Infectious Diseases estimated that the more contagious Delta variant accounted for more than 90 percent of all new cases in Japan as of mid-August. The number of patients with serious symptoms across the nation was 1,716 on Aug. 17, up by 70 from a day earlier and smashing the record for the sixth straight day. Tokyo accounted for 276 of the seriously ill patients, breaking the previous record of 160 set on Jan. 20. At an out-of-session meeting of the Lower House’s Cabinet Committee on Aug. 18, Masato Imai, a lawmaker of the opposition Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan, asked the government to declare a state of emergency for the entire country. However, Shigeru Omi, chief of the government’s expert panel on responding to the COVID-19 pandemic, recommended a narrower focus. “This issue remains the problem of the Tokyo metropolitan area,” he said. Omi said an intensive response over a short period would be preferable to a state of emergency across Japan. Japan reported 23,916 new COVID-19 cases as of 8 p.m. on Aug. 18, topping the earlier record of 20,362 set on Aug. 13 by more than 3,000. Twenty-seven prefectures confirmed new daily highs in confirmed infections.

0,Japan to release details about Lambda variant infections,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"August 19, 2021 at 15:53 JST"," The central government will soon start releasing information about cases of the Lambda variant of the novel coronavirus that have been identified in Japan. Officials currently make public the number of confirmed “variant of concern” cases, based on the National Institute of Infectious Diseases’ definitions. But the Lambda variant has still not appeared on the list. The government will include Lambda variant cases “in a way that will alleviate public concerns,” Chief Cabinet Secretary Katsunobu Kato said at a news conference on Aug. 18. A top health ministry official said the government also plans to release details about variant of concern and “variant of interest” cases, as defined by the World Health Organization. The WHO has designated the Lambda strain as a variant of interest. The first case of the Lambda variant in Japan was confirmed on July 20 at Haneda Airport in Tokyo. A woman arriving from Peru for the Tokyo Olympics tested positive on arrival. But that information was not made public until Aug. 6, when it was revealed following persistent inquiries by news media to the ministry. Kato said the case was handled “according to the health ministry’s guidelines.” He added, “But people have various interests and concerns.” Takaji Wakita, the head of the NIID, said at a news conference on Aug. 18 that the Lambda variant caused a relative majority of infections in Peru, Chile and Ecuador. “But it is on a declining trend globally,” he said. He said he does not think the Lambda variant is more transmissible than the Delta variant. “There are not many travelers from these three countries. Under current circumstances, the risk of spreading the Lambda variant in Japan is very low.”",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14421032

Ministry officials were supposed to send a list of names of those believed to be in close contact with the woman to the Tokyo Olympics organizer and local governments where they planned to stay. But that did not happen, the ministry said. “It was an omission during our handling of many issues,” a ministry official said on Aug. 18. “A major problem is that we don’t have a system to double-check.” Passengers seated within two rows of the Peruvian woman, both front and back, were likely exposed to the virus.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14421011

0,Nurses fight to save COVID-19 patients battling virus at home,['By YUSUKE NAGANO/ Staff Writer'],"August 18, 2021 at 19:03 JST"," FUJISAWA, Kanagawa Prefecture--As the number of COVID-19 patients battling the disease at home surges, nurses being dispatched to care for them are reporting cases that suddenly turn severe and illnesses lasting longer than in previous waves. At 9 a.m. on Aug. 16, a team of nurses and other workers began an online meeting at a conference room in a building here to share information on their patients fighting COVID-19 at home. “The family of a man we red-flagged yesterday called 911 that night,” one of the members said of the patient in his 50s. The red flag is a reference to patients with a blood oxygen saturation level reading of 93 percent or under. A reading of 96 percent or above is considered normal. The team convening at the Fujisawa city government’s support center belong to Sophiamedi Corp., a provider of visiting care services in Tokyo’s Shinagawa Ward. They are monitoring the health of COVID-19 patients who are on a waiting list for hospitalization or those requiring a close watch, including a reading of 95 percent or under for blood oxygen saturation levels. They are working in Fujisawa and elsewhere in the prefecture, under a contract with the Fujisawa city government and two other municipalities. As of Aug. 11, 74,135 patients with COVID-19 are recuperating at home across the nation, according to the health ministry, j umping to 13 times the number four weeks earlier. The patients were fighting the disease at home due to public health centers assessing their symptoms as mild or not serious enough to require hospitalization as health care systems around the country are at near full capacity for accepting patients. Most of the patients battling the virus at home, more than 60 percent, are in the Tokyo metropolitan area, including Kanagawa Prefecture. An alarming fact about patients with COVID-19 is that mild or moderate symptoms can worsen abruptly and become fatal. In Tokyo, the deaths of seven patients have been reported so far in August alone, including a man in his 30s with no underlying health conditions. On Aug. 16, the Sophiamedi team called patients in Fujisawa to ask them a list of questions on how they were faring, such as if they had difficulty breathing or if their fingertips had turned purplish. They jotted down the replies and any points that were cause for concern. If patients mention complaints about their health, the team recommends a visit by a nurse or an online interview by a doctor to assess if they need hospitalization. PATIENTS TOLD TO RECOVER AT HOME CAN'T STAND “A month ago, patients could be admitted to hospitals without much trouble, but not anymore,” Ikumi Kondo, a nurse, said. “I hear a growing sense of urgency in their voices.” A month ago, the team was in charge of 11 patients. The number had shot up to 120 as of Aug. 16. To assess which patients need to be hospitalized, the Kanagawa prefectural government has introduced a scoring system. Six points, for example, are given to a patient whose blood oxygen saturation level is 93 percent or under. Patients with a total score of five points or above are supposed to be admitted to hospitals, according to the prefecture’s guidance. But today not all of them are. Some have been denied hospitalization as medical centers have been increasingly stretched over the past weeks with an explosive growth in new cases amid the current wave of infections. Patients recuperating at home are cleared three days after their symptoms have eased and 10 days after they began displaying symptoms. Kondo said patients are remaining ill longer in the latest fifth wave of infections. “In the third wave of infections during the year-end, many patients recovered after their fevers subsided in a couple of days,” she said. “But today, patients are fighting prolonged bouts.” At 2:30 p.m. on Aug. 16, nurse Kazuhiro Shine drove to a patient’s home in the city to determine whether he should be hospitalized. Shine put on protective clothing against the novel coronavirus in front of the entrance of his home. Aug. 16 marked the patient’s seventh day of recuperating at home. The patient, in his 40s, could not stand and sat on the floor near the entrance when Shine met him. It appeared that he had slight difficulty in breathing, but it had not become serious. With relatives at home watching his health, Shine assessed that the patient could continue his recuperation at home. But he conceded that his judgment could have been different if the health care system were not overwhelmed. “It is possible that I may have recommended hospitalization if I had seen him a month earlier,” Shine said. A patient another nurse visited was hospitalized the same day after consultation with a doctor. That day was her 12th spent recuperating at home. The patient, in her 50s, developed a serious condition, with a blood oxygen saturation level hovering between 80 and 90 percent and a fever that ran from above 38 degrees to above 39 degrees for more than a week. Shine, on his way back to the support center, said he had been doing his best to keep his patients alive. But he said fighting the latest wave of infections is proving to be an enormous challenge, compared with previous waves. “We have no clues about when the current infections will peak out,” he said. “It's excruciating to have to run a marathon with no goal in sight.”",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14420354

0,Governors find Japan’s virus countermeasures shockingly weak,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"August 18, 2021 at 18:24 JST"," Prefectural governors are sharply criticizing the central government for not taking stronger measures to fend off the most recent surge in novel coronavirus infections. The government has decided to extend the duration of the state of emergency and add seven more prefectures to the list of places covered by it, as the more powerful Delta variant spreads across the nation at a rapid clip. It also said it will strongly urge people to reduce by half the number of outings they make to crowded areas. But its aim is mainly to restrict entry to commercial facilities and the food floors of department stores, which falls short of the response prefectural leaders are looking for. “When you look at the infection situation today for Tokyo, its metropolitan area and other areas across Japan, can the government curb the spread of the infection with such a measure?” Osaka Governor Hirofumi Yoshimura rhetorically asked reporters on Aug. 17. “I think that they should impose stronger measures.” Yoshimura also said if the bed occupancy rate for patients with serious conditions reaches 50 percent in Osaka Prefecture, he will consider asking large commercial facilities to suspend their businesses and business operators to cancel their events. “We should do something like a lockdown,” he said. The governments of Tokyo, Saitama, Chiba and Kanagawa asked the central government to introduce measures to strongly curb foot traffic at department stores and elsewhere and impose restrictions on using railways and airlines. “I am very disappointed that the central government could not take drastic measures to curb foot traffic,” Kanagawa Governor Yuji Kuroiwa said at a task force meeting on Aug. 17. “Governors’ voices were not reflected in the measures,” he told reporters. “I felt a gap in perception (between us and) the central government. It’s shocking.” The state of emergency will take effect in Ibaraki Prefecture on Aug. 20. But the prefecture currently remains under pre-emergency measures, even though it asked the government to issue a state of emergency for the prefecture on Aug. 3. The daily average of new cases for the week in the prefecture was 189 as of Aug. 3. That increased to 266 cases as of Aug. 17. The prefectural government again asked the central government to declare a state of emergency on Aug. 13. On Aug. 16, Ibaraki Governor Kazuhiko Oigawa declared a local state of emergency. “The situation has reached a disastrous level,” he said. A senior official from the Ibaraki prefectural government said the state of emergency took too long to be issued for the prefecture. “I think the timing was late,” the official said. “I believe that they knew the pace of transmission is faster due to the Delta variant. They should do their measures all at once, not dole them out.” (This article was written by Hiroshi Ishizuka and Kayoko Geji.)",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14420379

Miyazaki Commercial High School in Miyazaki Prefecture said 13 team members tested positive for the virus while Tohoku Gakuin High School in Miyagi Prefecture said one of its players was infected. “When I think of the players’ disappointment, I am rendered speechless,” Eiji Hatta, chairman of the Japan High School Baseball Federation, said after the Miyazaki school’s withdrawal offer was accepted. “We have been making efforts to prevent the spread of infections, but a group infection has occurred. I am so sorry to put more strain on medical institutions.” The 103rd baseball tournament at Hanshin Koshien Stadium in Hyogo Prefecture is the first held in two years. Last year’s event was canceled because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Miyazaki high school will forfeit its second-round game on Aug. 19 against Chiben Gakuen Wakayama High School in Wakayama Prefecture. Tohoku Gakuin will do the same for its second-round game on Aug. 21 against Matsusho Gakuen High School in Nagano Prefecture. “I truly feel sorry for my team members because they can’t play at Koshien. It’s extremely disappointing,” Mitsuro Hashiguchi, head coach of the Miyazaki high school team, said. According to the tournament organizers, the 35 players and staff of the Miyazaki team arrived at their accommodation facility on Aug. 5. One of the players developed a fever in the early evening of Aug. 14 and tested positive on Aug. 15. Twelve others tested positive at a medical institution by the morning of Aug. 17. A health center said eight people were in close contact with the infected people. The tournament headquarters held an emergency task force meeting on Aug. 16 and judged that the Miyazaki team’s case was a group infection. The school offered to withdraw from the tournament on the morning of Aug. 17. Tohoku Gakuin won its first game on Aug. 11 against Aikodai Meiden High School in Aichi Prefecture. One of the Tohoku Gakuin players had a fever on Aug. 13 and later tested positive. Tohoku Gakuin offered to withdraw from the tournament on the evening of Aug. 17. “If my team plays in the next game, the infected person and people who were in close contact with him could be identified, which might affect the students’ future,” Tsuneyuki Abe, the school’s principal, said. “I feel really sorry, but we decided to bow out of the tournament.”",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14420292
0,"Involving police in surprise visits to bars, eateries called coercive",['By YOSHITAKA UNEZAWA/ Staff Writer'],"August 18, 2021 at 16:56 JST"," Surprise visits to Tokyo bars and restaurants by metropolitan officials to check for compliance with anti-COVID-19 requests are drawing fire for including police officers, which puts undue pressure on owners, critics say. The manager of an “izakaya” Japanese-style pub in Shinjuku said the first thing he felt was fear upon seeing a group of four strangers suddenly enter his establishment who looked like they had no intention of being customers. The izakaya, run by the man in his 20s, had been complying with the metropolitan government’s requests until about May. But according to the manager, the decision was made to open up because the total rent of group businesses came to about 10 million yen ($91,200) a month. The manager said such explanations were ignored by the visiting metropolitan government officials, who only reiterated their request for cooperation. When asked why a police officer had to be part of the team, a metropolitan government official said it was intended to prevent trouble. Since early August, teams of four have been visiting bars and restaurants in the major entertainment districts of the capital. Two members are metropolitan government officials who are accompanied by a police officer and a firefighter. Media representatives were allowed to observe the visitation program in early August. The visits are intended to convince bars and restaurants to comply with metropolitan government requests to close operations if alcohol is served and to call it a day at 8 p.m. if no alcohol is provided. Before the visits started, metropolitan government officials checked on the exterior of bars and restaurants from July 12 and found that of a total of 129,193 establishments, 4,872, or 3.7 percent of the total, were still open after 8 p.m. The visits were initially focused on five areas, Shinjuku, Shibuya, Shinbashi, Ueno and Ikebukuro. Four days were set aside for the visits from Aug. 3. The four-man teams made their visits for about two hours from 8:30 p.m. and went to about 20 establishments each night. The areas of Roppongi, Akasaka and Kichijoji will be added as target areas and about 700 establishments will be visited by the end of August. Tsutomu Shimizu, a lawyer who belongs to a group trying to create a more positive image for the police, raised concerns that having police officers in the teams could be considered a strong-arm tactic. He said “psychological pressure” would be applied to those subject to the visits because they could become worried that the police might target them for other suspected crimes if they did not comply with the requests. The central government has encouraged including police officers and firefighters in the visiting groups as an effective way to gain cooperation. But currently, the only other prefecture that has turned to the police is Osaka. The four other prefectures currently under a state of emergency have not used police officers on the grounds that it could place undue pressure on the businesses.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14420308

0,Koike under fire over denials of Olympic link to infection surge,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"August 17, 2021 at 19:05 JST"," Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike, once praised for her anti-virus efforts, now faces increasing criticism over her adamant denials that the Olympics were linked to the explosion of new COVID-19 cases in the capital. Koike has dismissed assertions that hosting the Summer Games was connected to the continuing sharp surge in infections, although studies show that a record-setting number of Tokyoites contracted the virus when the Olympics were being held. Experts on the Tokyo metropolitan government’s panel on responding to the pandemic said Aug. 12 that the novel coronavirus situation in the capital was “out of control.” They added that the virus was spreading at an unprecedented pace. Panel member Norio Omagari, director of the Disease Control and Prevention Center under the National Center for Global Health and Medicine, suggested a link between the Tokyo Olympics and the rising caseload that is overwhelming the medical system. “Crowds were seen outside competition venues and nearby streets to root for Olympians,” he said at the meeting. But Koike bluntly rejected his observation at a news conference the following day. “What he is saying is based on the impression he had,” Koike said. “We have data on the numbers.” She added: “It is important to speak based on evidence, not episodes.” Critics and health experts had repeatedly questioned the wisdom of staging the Olympics in the densely populated metropolis amid the pandemic, even if spectators were banned from attending. They warned that government approval of holding the event could lead many in the public, weary of government-issued states of emergency and “stay-home” instructions, to let their guards down and go out to enjoy the festive mood of the sports extravaganza. But Koike has consistently denied that has happened, citing TV viewing rates exceeding 20 percent during the Games. She has said the Olympics did help people stay home. On Aug. 13, she reiterated her position, saying: “People rooted for athletes while staying home as teleworking became more common. That is why the viewer rating went up.” The same day, the metropolitan government abruptly published a study report that backed the governor’s position. The study compared the flow of people near the competition venues in central Tokyo before and during the Olympics. It concluded that overall, crowds were smaller during the event, compared with the pre-Olympic period, although pedestrian traffic surged temporarily during the Opening and Closing ceremonies and at race competitions held on public roads. Other data, however, showed that during the Olympics, crowds did not thin significantly in Tokyo’s entertainment districts in the late night hours, despite the heightened risk of contracting and transmitting the virus. According to a report from the Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Medical Science, the number of people who stayed outdoors for leisure purposes during the Aug. 1-Aug. 7 week was down by 17.6 percent from the week until July 12, when the capital was placed under its fourth state of emergency. It was also down by 20.8 percent during the July 25-July 31 week, compared with the last week before the emergency declaration. Experts say it takes about two weeks at the longest until an infected individual is counted as a COVID-19 patient, including the incubation period and the time needed to get tested. The infection trajectory in recent weeks points to an explosion of infections when the Olympics were being held until Aug. 8. Tokyo reported a record 5,773 newly confirmed infections on Aug. 13. Two weeks earlier, on July 30, the Olympic Games were in full swing. The seven-day average of new cases, which indicates the extent of the spread, was 3,820 as of the week through Aug. 6, two weeks after the Games opened on July 23. The average soared to 4,264 over the week through Aug. 15. Many bars and restaurants have defied metropolitan authorities’ requests to halt alcohol sales during the state of emergency. Such places were seen full of customers, including those who were not watching the Olympics. Experts note that a big difference in the latest and largest wave of infections in Tokyo since late July is that the highly contagious Delta variant is now responsible for a vast majority of new COVID-19 cases around the capital and the rest of Japan. Early in the pandemic, Koike won accolades for holding frequent news conferences to keep the public informed about the situation in Tokyo and her consistent calls for residents to take anti-virus measures. But her outright dismissal of health experts’ remarks on crowds during the Olympics as a mere “impression” drew criticism even from officials in her own government. “Listening only when experts say something convenient for her and ignoring them at other times raises questions about her perspectives as a leader,” a senior metropolitan government official said. The official also said Koike’s insistence that the flow of people declined due to the positive impact of the Olympics was a far cry from what ordinary people perceived.

The government’s task force approved on Aug. 17 not only extending the deadline for the state of emergency and pre-emergency measures, but it also added 17 prefectures to the list on top of the 12 already covered. The state of emergency for six prefectures, including Tokyo, its three neighbors as well as Osaka and Okinawa will be extended beyond the Aug. 31 deadline, until Sept. 12. Seven prefectures will be added under the state of emergency from Aug. 20 until Sept. 12: Tochigi, Ibaraki and Gunma in the greater Tokyo metropolitan area; Shizuoka in the Tokai region; Hyogo and Kyoto, which border Osaka; and Fukuoka on the main southern island of Kyushu. Pre-emergency measures will be implemented as of Aug. 20 for 10 more prefectures: Miyagi, Yamanashi, Toyama, Gifu, Mie, Okayama, Hiroshima, Kagawa, Ehime and Kagoshima. The government’s expert panel dealing with the pandemic gave the proposal its nod at a meeting that same day. Yasutoshi Nishimura, the state minister in charge of economic revitalization who also leads the central government effort against the pandemic, started the meeting with a stark reminder that the nation is in the grips of a more intense coronavirus surge than what it has faced before. “The situation is an unprecedented one around the nation, where the pace at which new infections are spreading is on a totally different scale,” he said. In the 29 prefectures covered by the state of emergency or pre-emergency measures, governors can ask bars and restaurants to refrain from serving alcohol. Those prefectures will also be asked to impose entry restrictions on customers at commercial outlets with a floor space of at least 1,000 square meters. Prefectural governors will also be given the option of asking these outlets to close shop on weekends. It follows reports of infection clusters arising among customers who shopped in congested food-product areas in department stores. Nishimura also said the government would make other requests with the goal of halving pedestrian traffic in congested locations. That includes calling on residents to cut down on the number of their shopping trips by half. COVID-19 cases continue to rise sharply around the nation, due mainly to the more virulent Delta variant. New daily cases topped 20,000 for the first time on Aug. 13, and the number of COVID-19 patients with serious symptoms has also been rising, particularly among those in their 40s and 50s.

Kono during a TV program aired on Aug. 16 said the central government has reached an agreement with the U.S. pharmaceutical company to supply enough vaccine for a third dose to boost immunity against the novel coronavirus. He said he will disclose the details “at some point in the near future.” The central government is still discussing if it is necessary to provide an additional third dose of COVID-19 vaccines. “At least for the next year, we have secured enough doses to provide a third shot to people who have received two doses of either Pfizer’s or Moderna’s vaccine this year,” Kono said. But he added, “We need to see how much the immunity is lasting” among people who received early vaccinations, such as health care workers and elderly people. At the same time, he said the government will prioritize providing the second shot to people over offering a third shot to those who are fully vaccinated. The government in July signed an agreement with Moderna Inc. to supply an additional 50 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine. These vaccines will be provided as early as the beginning of next year. The government is also expected to receive 150 million doses of vaccines manufactured by Novavax Inc., a U.S. company, starting from the beginning of next year, but the vaccine has yet to be approved in the United States. Kono said the government has secured the Novavax vaccines as a backup to the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines. Whether people should receive the same maker’s vaccine for their third shot will depend on future research findings, Kono said.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14419563

0,Okinawa’s popularity exacts a toll as Delta variant surges,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"August 16, 2021 at 18:28 JST"," NAHA--Okinawa Prefecture is in dire straits because of the surge in coronavirus outbreaks--even more so than in Tokyo, which has seen unprecedented levels of infections in recent weeks. In the southernmost prefecture, new cases per 100,000 people in the last week came to 249, surpassing Tokyo’s figure. “Our health care system is on the verge of collapse,” Governor Denny Tamaki said, expressing a sense of heightened alarm on Aug. 12, when the prefecture logged 732 daily new cases, a record at the time. In Okinawa Prefecture, the hospital-bed occupancy rate reached 87 percent and all the beds for severely ill patients were full as of Aug. 11, according to data from the central government’s Cabinet Secretariat. Key factors driving the steep surge in infections include an influx of hordes of tourists from the Tokyo metropolitan area and large cities in the Kansai region, and the highly contagious Delta variant sweeping through the prefecture. Kazutoshi Nakajima, a professor of infectious diseases at Daito Bunka University in Tokyo, said a prefecture that relies on tourism as a main source of revenue, such as Okinawa, will likely see new variants brought in from outside the prefecture. “It is possible that Delta was brought to Okinawa as prefectural officials were succeeding in efforts to contain the coronavirus,” said Nakajima, who served as a member of a World Health Organization team on the response to infectious diseases. Data based on estimates from GPS information on users of NTT Docomo Inc. mobile phones shows that the flow of visitors from outside the prefecture began to decrease after it peaked in early May from the Golden Week holiday period. In fact, the flow of people plunged by more than 70 percent from its peak the week after May 23, when Okinawa was placed under a state of emergency. But the number of new cases began going up in late June, after the state of emergency was lifted for Tokyo and Osaka Prefecture. By the middle of July, new cases rebounded to more than half the numbers logged during Golden Week. The number of new infections declined again in late July due to typhoons. The infection trajectory was moving upward again when summer holidays began along with the Bon season, in which throngs of Japanese travelers head to their ancestral hometowns or vacation venues. Most of the visitors to the prefecture, one of the most popular tourism destinations in Japan, are from Tokyo, Kanagawa, Chiba, Saitama, Osaka, Hyogo, Aichi and Fukuoka prefectures. The Delta variant is now being detected in many new infection cases after more and more people descended on the prefecture in recent weeks. The variant did not show up in coronavirus testing until the middle of June. But then cases of people infected with the highly infectious Delta strain began surging in July. In the week from July 19 to July 25, the Delta variant accounted for 34 percent of newly confirmed infections. Its share soared to 57 percent between July 26 and Aug. 1 and 79 percent between Aug. 2 and Aug. 8. The variant is quickly spreading in Naha, which is the gateway to Okinawa, central areas and places south of the prefecture where many tourist sites are located. A local tourism association on Aug. 11 pleaded with tourists to refrain from traveling to the prefecture due to the overwhelmed health care system. They also urged visitors to take a PCR test at the airport they will depart from if their trips to Okinawa cannot be avoided or postponed. Nakajima backed the association's plea, pointing to the fact that Okinawa is an island prefecture. “They cannot transfer patients to hospitals in other prefectures,” he said. “This is not the right time to go to Okinawa if we are to protect its health care system.”",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14418828

0,"‘No bed at Narita if you catch virus abroad,’ experts warn vacationers",['By YUKI EDAMATSU/ Staff Writer'],"August 16, 2021 at 17:25 JST"," Anyone thinking of leaving Japan for a summer vacation should consider “scrapping their plans” as no beds are available for COVID-19 patients near Narita International Airport, health experts are warning. The airport in Chiba Prefecture has seen a spate of cases in which a passenger returning from summer vacation abroad has tested positive for the novel coronavirus upon arrival. The traveler then has been quarantined at a designated hotel and developed severe symptoms, but had nowhere to go because beds for COVID-19 patients at area hospitals are full. Entrants to Japan who test positive at an airport are required to stay at a hotel designated by the airport’s quarantine station until they test negative twice. There are currently 60 or so returnees staying at hotels near the airport after testing positive for the virus upon arrival, said Kazunari Tanaka, who heads the quarantine station at Narita Airport managed by the health ministry. Twenty percent of them have displayed symptoms such as fever, Tanaka said. Some have had temperatures that ran nearly 40 degrees. For many, their blood oxygen saturation level has remained at around 93 percent, which requires oxygen therapy. Two to three patients have been diagnosed every week with symptoms that required them to be hospitalized. In these cases, the quarantine station has directly made a request to hospitals in the prefecture to take them in. But many area hospitals have refused the station’s request since around late July as hospital beds became increasingly unavailable. In the past week, hospitals turned down almost all requests to accept COVID-19 patients, Tanaka said. The quarantine center fortunately found a hospital to send patients to, but it is 80 kilometers away. The usage rate of hospital beds for COVID-19 patients in Chiba Prefecture was 67 percent as of Aug. 12, falling into the “stage 4” category. “If the number of returnees who need hospitalization increases, it would deprive Chiba Prefecture residents of valuable beds,” Tanaka said. Preparing for the shortage of hospital beds, the station on Aug. 13 ordered five oxygen enrichment devices that can be used at a hotel to treat quarantined patients. Tanaka is worried that a large number of people who travel overseas for a summer vacation will contract the virus during the trip and bring it back when they return to the airport in Japan. Some countries are allowing the entry of visitors from Japan without requiring an isolation period if an entrant shows proof of a negative COVID-19 test result. Tanaka urges people to “think again if you really need to travel overseas now.” COVID-19 cases are still spreading globally. If a passenger who travels overseas contracts the virus on their trip and is unable to obtain proof of a negative test result, they may be banned from entering Japan.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14418747

The woman, in her 30s, landed at Haneda Airport in Tokyo on July 20. She tested positive for COVID-19 upon arrival. The National Institute of Infectious Diseases later analyzed the virus data and confirmed that it was a new strain known as the Lambda variant, according to the health ministry and other sources. In Peru, the woman’s point of departure, the Lambda variant has been wreaking havoc. According to Pablo Tsukayama, a Peruvian molecular geneticist at the University of Cayetano Heredia in Lima, who first detected the Lambda variant, the strain's infectability is particularly strong because it has spread quickly in a span of only three months. As of July, 80 percent of the new infection cases in Peru were caused by the Lambda variant, Tsukayama said. The variant has been confirmed in more than 40 countries, mainly in Central and South America.

Health Minister Norihisa Tamura and other ministers responding to the COVID-19 health crisis are expected to discuss the declaration at a meeting as early as Aug. 16. The government is expected to officially decide on the declaration for those newly targeted prefectures, which are currently under pre-emergency measures, as soon as Aug. 17. Government officials are also discussing the need to extend the current state of emergency for Tokyo and Saitama, Chiba, Kanagawa, Osaka and Okinawa prefectures, which is set to expire at the end of August. It urges eating and drinking establishments in those areas offering alcoholic beverages to suspend their operations. The government is also seeking to add more prefectures to the 13 that are currently under p re-emergency measures. On July 12, the government extended the state of emergency for Okinawa Prefecture and declared it for Tokyo for the fourth time. On Aug. 2, it extended the declarations until Aug. 31 and designated Saitama, Chiba, Kanagawa and Osaka prefectures, which were under pre-emergency measures, to the state of emergency status. On Aug. 16, the Shizuoka prefectural government asked the central government to place the prefecture under a state of emergency.

0,Doctor tackles gap in public’s view of COVID-19 symptoms,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"August 16, 2021 at 16:18 JST"," A doctor is leveraging the power of social media to warn people how large the gap is between how they view the severity of COVID-19 symptoms and how medical professionals understand them. And his effort is attracting tremendous attention in Japan. Kosuke Yasukawa, 39, a physician who treats COVID-19 patients in the United States, made an infographic that illustrates this difference in perceptions and posted it on Twitter. It quickly went viral. The graphic warns that someone with moderate COVID-19 symptoms will likely experience the most difficult struggle of their life when battling the illness. The public, however, thinks that someone with moderate symptoms will simply experience some difficulty in breathing. Patients with moderate symptoms are likely to have a fever, cough and struggle to breathe well for days due to pneumonia. “For many people who have never experienced a serious illness, it will be the most difficult condition they experience in their lives,” said Yasukawa, an assistant professor at the medical department of Georgetown University. If it becomes necessary to administer oxygen to a patient, they would be classified under “moderate II.” But based on the U.S. standard, they would fall into a category of “serious.” If patients are put on ventilators, their condition would be considered “serious.” But according to the U.S. standard, they would be categorized under “critical.” Yasukawa is trying to give people a reality check about the dangers of COVID-19. Even for patients with moderate symptoms, their pneumonia can worsen within just a few days and their condition might become serious. He created the illustration out of concern that the public does not understand the terms describing the severity levels of COVID-19 symptoms in the same way that the medical community does. Just 10 days after posting his graphic on Twitter on July 20, 14 million people had seen it. According to the graphic, the general population views mild symptoms as being “like a cold,” while doctors recognize them as “not needing help breathing.” Yasukawa said that all patients without pneumonia are categorized as “mild” in Japan. But mild symptoms vary greatly from person to person. Some patients only have a fever or cough for a short time, while other people also suffer from vomiting, diarrhea or other symptoms. “Many people suffer greatly from a variety of symptoms for days and days,” he said. He added that some people also suffer from side effects, such as malaise, shortness of breath and taste disorders, for months. “Please don’t think of it as just a cold,” he said. The stark warning comes as the much more powerful Delta variant rages like wildfire in Japan and abroad. Yasukawa is urging people to continue to take basic anti-virus measures such as wearing masks, washing their hands, social distancing, getting vaccinated, and ensuring that there is proper ventilation.

The health ministry reported a record number of COVID-19 patients with serious symptoms, many of whom are being treated in intensive care units. It said 1,478 patients showed severe symptoms on Aug. 12, surpassing the previous record of 1,413 set at the peak of the fourth wave of infections in spring. Hospital beds for patients with serious symptoms were almost filled in Tokyo and its three neighboring prefectures of Chiba, Kanagawa and Saitama as well as Okinawa, the nation's southernmost prefecture. Fresh COVID-19 cases nationwide on Aug. 13 reached 20,366, the first time for the daily tally to exceed 20,000. The Tokyo metropolitan government does not automatically include COVID-19 patients in ICUs as having serious symptoms, so it said there were only 218 serious cases requiring ventilators or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, also known as an ECMO lung bypass machine, as of Aug. 12. But using the health ministry definition gave Tokyo a total of 947 patients with serious symptoms as of Aug. 11. And the pace at which serious patients are increasing has also accelerated. During the fourth wave, it took 53 days for the number of seriously ill patients to reach the 1,400 mark from 400. But this time around, it took just 20 days. Authorities also reported explosive growth in new cases among those still not vaccinated. About 70 percent of patients with serious symptoms in Tokyo are under the age of 60, officials said. The ratios at which hospital beds for patients with serious symptoms were filled as of Aug. 12 hit 81 percent in Tokyo and 96 percent in Kanagawa Prefecture, according to statistics compiled by the Cabinet Secretariat. But an official in Kanagawa coordinating the transport of patients to hospitals said hospital beds were being immediately filled once patients are discharged. A Tokyo official handling hospitalizations said 75 requests were submitted by patients with serious symptoms on Aug. 10, but no hospital beds were available that day for 50 of them. Chiba Governor Toshihito Kumagai expressed fears of an “invisible natural disaster” in the making while talking to reporters Aug. 12, noting that the general public seems to be oblivious to the unfolding crisis that has overwhelmed the medical care structure. While 40 percent of hospital beds for patients with serious symptoms in Chiba are still available, Kumagai said the actual situation was one in which all beds were essentially taken since those still open were being prepared for hospitalized patients with moderate symptoms that suddenly worsen. Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga told reporters Aug. 13 he had instructed Cabinet ministers handling the health crisis to begin considering setting up “oxygen stations” for COVID-19 patients recuperating at home and in need of oxygen inhalation.

0,Tokyo secures 36 hospital beds for infected patients denied treatment,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"August 13, 2021 at 18:35 JST"," The Tokyo metropolitan government said it has secured 36 hospital beds for COVID-19 patients whose requests for medical treatment are rejected by all hospitals contacted. The 36 beds chosen at 11 Tokyo-run and other hospitals will be used to temporarily treat COVID-19 patients until vacant beds become available, the government said Aug. 12. Only some of the beds can be used to treat seriously ill patients, and the metropolitan government has yet to decide on the specific requirements for access to the beds. Increasingly, hospitals in the capital have had to turn away COVID-19 patients because their beds are already filled up. Infected individuals have ended up stuck inside ambulances or been forced to go home and wait for a hospital bed to become available. Under the central government’s new policy, hospitalizations in areas hit hard by the virus should be limited to patients in serious condition or who are at risk of developing serious symptoms. The Tokyo metropolitan government will try to reduce the number of patients in the latter category by promoting the use of an antibody cocktail therapy. The therapy is believed effective in reducing the risk of serious symptoms developing among obese patients and those with underlying diseases. About 20 special hospital beds for the therapy have been secured in the capital, a metropolitan government official said. Patients aged 50 or older who are at a higher risk of becoming severely ill will be given priority for the special beds. Under the initial phase of the plan, patients recuperating at accommodation facilities will be transferred to the special beds and spend a night there while undergoing the antibody cocktail therapy. The metropolitan government plans to eventually dispatch doctors to an accommodation facility for use as a temporary medical center, and provide the cocktail therapy for patients recuperating at other hotels. The number of hospitalized COVID-19 patients in Tokyo reached 3,667 on Aug. 11, accounting for 56.8 percent of the hospital beds. The number of patients with serious symptoms has increased, particularly among people in their 40s and 50s. The Tokyo metropolitan government defines serious cases as those requiring ventilators or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, also known as an ECMO lung bypass machine. If the health ministry’s definition of “serious” is used, which also includes patients in intensive care units, Tokyo’s bed-occupancy rate for patients in serious condition would be nearly 80 percent.

The panel on Aug. 12 compiled a list of recommendations and called on the central and local governments as well as the general public to intensify their infection-prevention measures. Infected patients in Tokyo are finding it increasingly difficult to find open hospital beds. There has also been a sharp spike in COVID-19 patients who have to recuperate at home. “We are approaching a situation where lives that could have been saved will not be,” Shigeru Omi, the panel chairman, said. The panel pointed out that outings are increasing not only among younger Tokyo residents but also middle-aged people who are at greater risk of developing serious symptoms if they have yet to be vaccinated. The panel said one key goal is to bring the “effective reproduction number,” or how many people a COVID-19 patient has infected, to under 1, which would mean new infections have stopped spreading. It said reducing pedestrian traffic to 50 percent of the level before the start of the fourth state of emergency was the absolute minimum condition to reach that target. The panel recommended that the general public halve outings to congested areas. It also called for more forceful measures to reduce the number of customers at food sales floors in department stores. But the panel also compiled activities that could be continued because they carried a reduced risk of infection. They included visits to parks and libraries. The panel also urged the central and local governments to take immediate steps to bolster the medical care structure as one way to obtain the cooperation of the general public. Saying the pandemic should be dealt with as though medical care was being provided in a natural disaster area, the panel called on authorities to also seek the cooperation of health care professionals who are now not directly involved in treating COVID-19 patients. When asked why the recommendations were issued when the Bon holiday season had already begun, Omi said the intent was to gain some form of an effective result before the scheduled Aug. 31 end of the current state of emergency. Yasutoshi Nishimura, the state minister for economic revitalization who also heads the central government’s effort to deal with the pandemic, did not present any new measures. He only said that continued close cooperation would be sought with prefectural governors. (This article was written by Kai Ichino and Keishi Nishimura.)",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14417055

It was reported at the meeting that the daily average of new cases over the week through Aug. 11 stood at 3,934, more than double, compared with two weeks earlier, indicating that infections are spreading at an unprecedented pace. Omagari said if the current pace were maintained, the seven-day average of new cases could hit 5,113 on Aug. 25. “We will not be able to save people’s lives” that can be saved under the normal circumstances, he said. “We are at a stage where each of us need to act to protect our own lives.” Masataka Inokuchi, vice chairman of the Tokyo Medical Association, said the capital’s health care system has become dysfunctional due to the deepening health crisis. “Regular medical care, including emergency care and scheduled surgeries, has also been seriously affected,” he said. “Maintaining the health care system would be difficult if the pace of the spread (in the coming weeks) remains at the same level as now.” Hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in Tokyo totaled 3,667 as of Aug. 11, with 56.8 percent of the beds filled, according to officials.

0,Tokyo doctors fear surge in deaths of virus patients at home,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"August 12, 2021 at 16:17 JST"," Doctors in Tokyo are now making heart-wrenching decisions of telling COVID-19 patients to wait at home for an open hospital bed, knowing that hospital treatment may remain unavailable even if their health deteriorates. In this fifth wave of novel coronavirus infections, many of the patients waiting at home are in their prime. Staff at Shinjuku Hiro Clinic in Tokyo’s Shinjuku Ward were monitoring about 60 COVID-19 patients who were recuperating at home as of Aug. 9. Hiroo Hanabusa, the 60-year-old director of the clinic, said public health centers have increasingly requested house calls for at-home COVID-19 patients or online checkups since late July. In early August, a man in his 60s developed a 40-degree fever and his blood oxygen saturation level dropped to 89 percent. Hanabusa visited the patient at his home, recognized that he should be admitted to a hospital, and called for an ambulance after consulting a public health center. But no hospital beds were available, and the patient, who has a pre-existing condition, was stuck in an ambulance for four hours. Hanabusa had no choice but to supply supplemental oxygen to the patient at his home. Two days later, the man was finally admitted to a hospital. “Our clinic is treating five patients who receive administration of oxygen,” Hanabusa said. At least one of the patients is in their 20s, he said. Under the central government’s new guideline, hospitalization in areas where the virus is surging is limited to those with severe symptoms, patients with moderate symptoms who require oxygen inhalation, and those deemed at a high risk of developing serious symptoms. Local physicians now must decide who should be hospitalized and who should be sent home. The virus spread in some areas is so bad that even patients who require immediate hospitalization have no place to go and must wait at home for the next available hospital bed. “The wait time has gotten longer, from several hours to several days,” Hanabusa said. “If the number of patients further increases, they may never be admitted to a hospital.” In addition, doctors may be unable to save some COVID-19 patients recuperating at home if a shortage of oxygen concentrators occurs. “Whether the pace of improving the medical system can catch up with the huge wave of infections will determine the future,” he said. Hiroshi Suzuki, a 60-year-old doctor at an internal medicine clinic in Tokyo’s Ota Ward, voiced similar concerns. “Patients who are essentially required to be hospitalized are staying at home now. We will soon have to see patients in their 40s and 50s die in their homes,” Suzuki said. Suzuki visited a COVID-19 patient in her 50s who was recovering at home on Aug. 7. The woman contracted the virus in late July, and her medicine had run out. When Suzuki arrived at her home, she was too weak to even get up. The doctor said the woman apparently contracted the virus from her child, and she was at risk of developing severe symptoms based on her age. Suzuki believes there will be an increase in cases of patients’ conditions worsening at their homes. He also said he has heard complaints from at-home patients that they never receive phone calls from public health centers to check on their health. Some patients said they were afraid they would die because of high fevers. The Tokyo metropolitan government has provided food and water to those recovering at home. But some patients told Suzuki that they did not receive a care package even a week after testing positive for the virus. “I am particularly worried about patients who live alone,” Suzuki said. According to the health ministry, 45,269 COVID-19 patients were recuperating at home as of Aug. 4. The number was 11.3 times more than the figure four weeks ago, and 2.4 times more than the total from a week ago. The latest number is also higher than those of the peak periods during the third and fourth waves of infections in Japan. Tokyo leads the nation in the number of patients recuperating at home, with more than 19,000 as of Aug. 11. That is a tenfold increase from the number four weeks ago.

0,Panel: COVID-19 situation in Japan becoming ‘natural disaster’,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"August 12, 2021 at 14:16 JST"," Two-thirds of Japan’s prefectures are experiencing an explosion of novel coronavirus infections, and a health ministry panel warned that the COVID-19 situation was approaching the level of a “natural disaster.” Nationwide, a daily record 15,812 new COVID-19 cases were reported as of 9 p.m. on Aug. 11. Nine prefectures, mainly in western Japan, posted record high daily tallies. The number of COVID-19 patients with serious symptoms was 1,332 on Aug. 10, up by 102 from the previous day. According to guidelines used by experts to classify infection-spread levels, 31 of Japan’s 47 prefectures were at the most serious stage 4, which indicates an “explosive growth” in infections. At an Aug. 11 meeting, the panel advising the health ministry in dealing with the pandemic pointed out that the sharp increase in new cases was fueling the rise in COVID-19 patients with serious symptoms as well as those waiting at home for a hospital bed to open up. A record high 19,396 infected patients around Japan on Aug. 11 were waiting for an open hospital bed. A man in his 30s who was showing mild symptoms died from COVID-19 the same day. The panel recommended that residents refrain from outings and travel across prefectural borders during the Bon holiday season, noting that a crisis situation could arise, resulting in many deaths. For the one-week period until Aug. 10, there were 77.6 new COVID-19 cases per 100,000 residents, a 1.33-fold increase over the previous week. The experts’ panel has set 25 cases per 100,000 residents as the cutoff line for designating a prefecture as being in stage 4, but 31 prefectures had exceeded that figure. Even in prefectures covered by pre-emergency measures, the figure rose over the previous week. Moreover, the ratio of occupied hospital beds set aside for COVID-19 patients exceeded 50 percent in 16 prefectures. Among the prefectures with extremely high ratios were Okinawa at 86.3 percent, Shiga at 81 percent, Fukushima at 79.2 percent and Kanagawa at 69.1 percent. According to studies by the Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Medical Science, pedestrian traffic in the capital decreased by 4.5 percent between 6 p.m. and midnight in the major entertainment districts in comparison to the previous week. But the level of pedestrian traffic has not fallen to the lowest level recorded during the third state of emergency in Tokyo declared in late April. And pedestrian traffic between 10 p.m. and midnight actually increased by 3.2 percent over the previous week. The more virulent Delta variant has also continued to spread rapidly in not only the Kanto region but also the Kansai region. A study by the National Institute of Infectious Diseases found that about 90 percent of the cases in the Kanto region and about 80 percent of the cases in the Kansai region could be traced to the Delta variant. According to preliminary statistics for June compiled by the health ministry, 5,387 unvaccinated senior citizens became infected, and 232, or 4.31 percent, died. In contrast, of the 112 seniors who became infected even after two vaccine jabs, only one, or 0.89 percent, died. Despite the positive news about the effects of the ongoing vaccination program, the Aug. 11 experts’ panel meeting was filled with gloomy predictions. Hiroshi Nishiura, a professor of theoretical epidemiology at Kyoto University, said if the current pace of new infections continues, Tokyo would have more than 10,000 new cases a day by late August, and the figure could approach 20,000 by early September. Other experts warned against optimism over a declining number of COVID-19 cases during the Bon holiday season. They said the lower infection numbers would be a result of a decrease in testing. “The number of new cases will appear to be falling, but will again increase thereafter,” said Kazuhiro Tateda, a professor of infectious diseases at Toho University. “There are no factors that give hope for a continual decrease.”",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14416315

Responses were obtained from 78 hospitals. The results announced on Aug. 10 found that 27 university hospitals, or 35 percent of the responding institutions, had implemented restrictions on accepting patients in the ICUs. Another 18 university hospitals said there was a possibility they would impose restrictions in the future. “We can assume that the situation is quickly approaching in which lives that in normal times would have been saved will no longer be,” said an AJMC official. Of the responding hospitals, 25 were located in areas covered by the COVID-19 state of emergency, while another 25 were in prefectures where pre-emergency measures are in place. Fifteen hospitals had also placed restrictions on accepting emergency patients, while 18 hospitals said there was the possibility such restrictions would be implemented in the future. Nineteen hospitals had placed restrictions on the surgeries performed, while another 17 said that possibility was likely in the future. Twenty hospitals had placed restrictions on accepting inpatients, while 16 said there was a possibility such limitations would be imposed at a later date. Among the reasons given for the various restrictions were the strained medical care situation caused by the need to care for COVID-19 patients as well as infections among hospital staff.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14415617

0,"Outside Olympic ‘bubble,’ 170,000 in Japan infected during Games",['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"August 9, 2021 at 15:25 JST"," Olympic organizers praised themselves for holding a “safe and secure” Summer Games in Tokyo, but many outside the “bubble” said the event only fueled the record-setting spread of the novel coronavirus around Japan. Hidemasa Nakamura, the Tokyo 2020 Games’ delivery officer, said at a news conference on Aug. 7 that the rate of positive COVID-19 tests among people involved with the Games was low. Athletes and Olympic-related people underwent a total of 600,000 tests, and 138 had tested positive for the virus as of Aug. 6, Nakamura said. The positivity rate, at 0.02 percent, was “evidence that the Olympics have been held safely and securely,” he said. Under health protocols, athletes and Olympic-related officials were supposed to stay within the “bubble” to prevent a possible spread of infections to the public. Outside of that bubble, the number of new COVID-19 cases reported over the 17-day sports event exceeded 170,000 around the nation, putting a further strain on health care workers. Although the bubble may have limited direct contact between Olympians and the public, it could not contain the festive atmosphere of the Games. Some health experts said it was only natural for members of the public to want to join the festivities of the sports extravaganza that was approved by their government. “I cannot deny that the Olympics have had an indirect impact on the (virus surge),” said Nobuhiko Okabe, head of the Kawasaki City Institute for Public Health who served as a special adviser to the Cabinet on infection controls for the Games. “People can’t help but prioritize a party-like mood,” Okabe said. “The fact that people’s defenses are down poses a risk.” On Aug. 7, the eve of the Closing Ceremony, an alarm frequently sounded at Yokohama Rosai Hospital, informing nurses that a patient’s blood-oxygen level has decreased. “Why in the world do they have to hold the Olympics now?” one of the nurses said. The hospital in Yokohama’s Kohoku Ward has made 32 beds available for COVID-19 patients with moderate and severe symptoms, and 31 were filled on that night. Although staff were busy monitoring and treating the COVID-19 patients, Ryo Takeshita, a 34-year-old emergency medical doctor, had to leave the hospital. He picked up an ID for the Olympics and headed for the nearby International Stadium Yokohama, where the men’s soccer final was about to kick off. He had been assigned to work at a first-aid station at the venue. “I like soccer, and I’m not opposed to holding the Olympics,” he said. “But the hospital is facing a tough time. I can’t help but think, ‘Should I really go?’” He went. Two days earlier, Takeshita was on duty at the emergency room of the hospital. During his overnight shift, the ER received 20 phone calls requesting admittance for COVID-19 patients. “It was an abnormal situation,” he said. The ER often received multiple requests at the same time. Staff had to ask ambulance crews about each patient’s condition and then give priority to those with more severe symptoms. “I just prayed that the patients who were turned down could hang on at their homes,” Takeshita said. Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga has denied the possibility that the Tokyo Olympics were related to the skyrocketing number of new COVID-19 cases. He insisted that the movement of people in busy areas of Tokyo “has not increased from the pre-Olympics period.” The Tokyo metropolitan government and the International Olympic Committee have echoed that view. But sharp increases in congestion of pedestrian traffic have been recorded. According to GPS data of NTT Docomo based on smartphone usage outdoors, an estimated 5,200 people were around the National Stadium at noon on July 23, when Blue Impulse, the Air Self-Defense Force’s aerobatics team, flew over Tokyo to celebrate the opening of the Olympics. That number was up by 3,000 from the weekly average until then. The congestion continued into the night when the Opening Ceremony was held at the National Stadium. During the Olympics, crowds formed around competition venues from time to time, even though spectators were largely banned from attending. Well after the start of the Olympic competitions, the virus was spreading so rapidly in Japan that the government extended the COVID-19 state of emergency for Tokyo and placed three surrounding prefectures, as well as Osaka Prefecture, under that declaration. However, many bars and restaurants have defied government requests to stop serving alcohol, and Olympics-watching drinking parties have been seen and heard around Tokyo. “Why didn’t the central government send a strong message, such as shutting down commercial facilities, when it issued a state of emergency?” Koji Wada, a professor at the International University of Health and Welfare, asked. “If it hesitated to do so because of the Olympics, the impact is huge,” he said.

The panel of experts at a meeting cautioned that ""an unprecedented and explosive spread of novel coronavirus cases is now under way in the capital.” The bleak description given by the experts was due to the rapid spread of the Delta variant as the dominant strain as well as the daily average of new cases over the past week reaching 3,443, which was 1.78-fold higher than the previous week’s average of 1,936. Panel member Norio Omagari, director of the Disease Control and Prevention Center under the National Center for Global Health and Medicine, presented calculations for what the average would be if the current trend continued. By Aug. 11, the daily average for the week would be 6,129, while by Aug. 18, the figure will skyrocket to 10,909. “That would mean that one out of every 1,000 Tokyo residents was infected,” Omagari said. “There is a need to share a sense of crisis about what the current reality is like.” The panel apparently felt the situation was so dire that a statement was needed that called for switching to a structure to deal with an emergency in all aspects of treatment of COVID-19 patients, from hospitalization to recuperation at home or other accommodations. The panel also observed that 3,399 Tokyoites were hospitalized as of Aug. 4, fast approaching the record figure of 3,427 reached on Jan. 12. The number of COVID-19 patients with serious symptoms also increased to 115 from the 80 of the previous week. The daily average of cases reported to the metropolitan government by local public health offices about not being able to find an open hospital bed for a COVID-19 patient came to 450, much higher than the 270 of the previous week. According to Masataka Inokuchi, vice chair of the Tokyo Medical Association, there were many cases in which patients were asked to recuperate at home because no hospital beds were available. The number of patients recuperating at home or other accommodations also surged to 29,703 from the 16,344 of the previous week. In particular, the number recuperating at home doubled over the previous week to 14,783. At the meeting, Inokuchi said, “We must further strengthen the follow-up mechanism so that we can get an early grasp of when the condition of those at home suddenly worsens and allow for immediate medical treatment to prevent having those recuperating at home from developing serious symptoms.” He also suggested that medical equipment for oxygen inhalation be installed at accommodations where patients are recuperating to allow such facilities to also function somewhat as a medical institution. The panel was also told that testing by the metropolitan government had found that 64.6 percent of the cases for the week through July 25 were due to the Delta variant, indicating a further spread of that variant since only 46.2 percent of the cases in the previous week were attributed to the more virulent strain. Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike pointed to the upcoming Bon holiday season and called on Tokyo residents to stay at home and postpone or cancel trips to family homes and elsewhere.

0,Coronavirus spreading at most serious rate in 23 prefectures,['By JUN TABUSHI/ Staff Writer'],"August 5, 2021 at 17:06 JST"," The novel coronavirus spread has “reached an unprecedented level” in Japan, with around half of the 47 prefectures now in the most serious stage in terms of rate of new infections, a health ministry expert panel said. The highest stage 4 level for new COVID-19 cases per 100,000 people is 25 over one week. Hit by the highly contagious Delta variant, 23 prefectures surpassed that threshold in the most recent week to Aug. 3. The rates for Tokyo and Okinawa Prefecture, which are both under a state of emergency, were 167.82 and 179.15, respectively. Other prefectures that are taking pre-emergency measures against the virus are also seeing soaring numbers of new COVID-19 cases. The figures were 32.61 new infections per 100,000 people for Fukushima, 46.33 for Ibaraki, 41.93 for Tochigi, 36.41 for Gunma, 30.58 for Yamanashi, and 30.83 for Nara. The national total was 58.54, 2.09 times the number for the preceding week. The total number of new COVID-19 cases in Japan hit a record 14,207 on Aug. 4, after topping 10,000 on July 29 for the first time. Tokyo reported a record 4,166 newly confirmed infections, while neighboring Saitama Prefecture logged 1,200, its new high. Fukuoka, Kyoto, Okinawa and nine other prefectures also renewed their daily record counts on that day. The panel urged authorities and citizens to share a heightened sense of crisis to combat the virus. According to the panel, screenings of positive samples found the Delta variant in 13,523 cases in total as of Aug. 2, almost double the number from the previous week. The National Institute of Infectious Diseases estimates the Delta variant now accounts for about 90 percent of new COVID-19 cases in the Kanto region and about 60 percent in the Kansai region. In Tokyo and eight other prefectures, the occupancy rate of hospital beds surpassed 50 percent, putting them in the most serious stage 4 for that category. Okinawa and Fukushima prefectures reported occupancy rates of 74.9 percent and 72.2 percent, respectively. The virus has also hit the Tokyo Olympics. Organizers said Aug. 4 that an infection cluster broke out at the Olympic Village, and five of 12 Greek artistic swimmers staying there have tested positive for the virus. The remaining seven Greek swimmers left the village and are staying at an outside facility as a precaution. Their test results were negative that day.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14411574
0,Pre-emergency measures to be expanded to 8 more prefectures,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"August 5, 2021 at 15:41 JST"," The government is expanding coverage of pre-emergency measures to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic to eight more prefectures as records for the number of daily infections are being shattered around the nation. The pre-emergency measures will cover the prefectures of Fukushima, Ibaraki, Tochigi, Gunma, Shizuoka, Aichi, Shiga and Kumamoto, and will be in place from Aug. 8 until Aug. 31. Five prefectures--Hokkaido, Ishikawa, Kyoto, Hyogo and Fukuoka--were placed under the pre-emergency measures from Aug. 2. It took only three days for the central government to decide to further expand the measures. Fukuoka is already asking the central government to declare a state of emergency for the prefecture to bring it in line with Tokyo and the five prefectures already under a state of emergency. A government panel of experts met on the morning of Aug. 5 and gave its consent to the expanded pre-emergency measures. A government task force met in the afternoon the same day to formally approve the decision. “In many areas of the nation, an unprecedented situation has developed causing a sharp increase in new infections at a pace we have never seen before,” Yasutoshi Nishimura, the state minister in charge of economic revitalization who also heads the central government’s efforts to deal with the novel coronavirus pandemic, said at the start of the meeting of the panel of experts. He said the medical care structure in many areas has been placed under enormous stress. Prefectures covered by the pre-emergency measures will be asked to request local bars and restaurants to refrain from serving alcohol, but prefectural governors can relax such requests if new COVID-19 cases are found to be on the decline and infection-prevention measures are in place at the establishments.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14411595
0,"Despite criticism, Suga sticks with restrictions on COVID-19 care",['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"August 5, 2021 at 14:26 JST"," Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga rebuffed criticism from all sides and stood by his government’s proposal to limit hospitalization of COVID-19 patients to only “serious” cases in areas where medical systems are strained. After ruling coalition lawmakers on Aug. 4 called for a retraction of the measure, Suga told reporters, “I hope to gain the understanding that this measure is intended to allow those who need medical care to receive it.” Under that policy, those requiring hospital care are defined as infected patients with serious symptoms and those at risk of falling seriously ill. COVID-19 patients with moderate or mild symptoms will be asked to recuperate at home. To quell concerns, Suga said the measure was not for the entire nation but only the greater Tokyo metropolitan area where the spread of COVID-19 infections has been especially rapid. He also said measures would be taken to ensure frequent contact with those recuperating at home so that they can been immediately hospitalized if their symptoms worsen. Local governments are preparing for the shift in the hospitalization policy, but doubts are being raised that they will have enough personnel to adequately check on the conditions of the expected increasing number of patients recovering at home. The Tokyo metropolitan government started revising its guidelines for deciding which COVID-19 patients should be hospitalized. The revision would leave out patients with mild symptoms. Tokyo has been hit by a record-setting spread of the novel coronavirus, which has led to a sharp increase in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. As of Aug. 4, there were 3,399 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in the capital. The hospital bed usage ratio has exceeded the 50-percent line that defines an area as being in the most serious stage 4 in terms of the infection spread. The metropolitan government also plans to strengthen observation of patients recuperating at home or other accommodations. A follow-up center was established in November 2020 to monitor such patients, and additional staff will be dispatched to cover the expected increase in those recuperating outside of hospitals. Pulse oximeters are being distributed to at-home patients to monitor their oxygen saturation levels. But about 14,000 Tokyo residents are already recuperating at home. A surge in their numbers could create a situation in which sufficient monitoring is impossible. “Under the current structure we have in place, there is the possibility that adequate follow-ups will not be possible if the condition of those recuperating at home should suddenly worsen,” said a high-ranking metropolitan government official in charge of medical care policy. “The risk arises of a larger number of those recuperating at home dying because they do not receive medical care.” Past waves of the virus have shown that the conditions of patients with mild symptoms can abruptly deteriorate, leading to death. Satoshi Kutsuna, a professor of infection disease control at Osaka University, said the more virulent Delta variant of the novel coronavirus has made matters worse. “Even if a patient is young and has no pre-existing condition, there is the possibility of symptoms becoming serious,” Kutsuna said. “Moreover, even if oxygen saturation levels may be dropping, the patient may not feel any symptoms, such as shortness of breath, if they are resting. “There will be a need for frequent monitoring of such patients to quickly detect when someone’s symptoms have worsened so they can be hospitalized.” In light of the staffing shortages in Tokyo, Kutsuna suggested having doctors and nurses remotely monitor such patients through online systems or by phone.

0,More patients remain stuck in ambulances as virus cases surge,['By RYO YAMAGISHI/ Staff Writer'],"August 4, 2021 at 18:53 JST"," More than 2,000 ambulances carrying emergency patients had to wait at least 30 minutes for a hospital to accept them in the week through Aug. 1, a government agency said. The Fire and Disaster Management Agency said the figure, 2,376, double the number logged in the first week of July, was likely the result of hospitals being filled up with COVID-19 patients. The ambulance delays were reported by 52 fire departments in major cities. The latest figure is the highest since January, when Japan was pounded by the third wave of coronavirus infections. Similarly, the ambulance delays are now increasing in tandem with the current surge in COVID-19 cases, according to the agency. The agency has kept weekly tabs since April 2020 on ambulances that had to remain at the patients’ homes for at least 30 minutes after more than three medical facilities could not accept them. During the third wave of infections in December and January, the number of delayed cases reached 3,317 as hospitals were already overwhelmed with COVID-19 patients. The peak during the fourth wave of infections in April and June was 2,064. The number of delays then steadily declined, along with the decreasing number of new COVID-19 cases. There were 1,115 cases of ambulance delays over the week until July 4. But the figure has rebounded and reached 2,202 during the week through July 25. Of the 2,376 cases in the latest count, 1,292 occurred in Tokyo, excluding those in Inagi city and outlying islands, up 14 percent from the previous week.

0,At-home care for infections proved nightmare in fourth wave,['By TAKEFUMI HORINOUCHI/ Staff Writer'],"August 4, 2021 at 18:38 JST"," KOBE—Tears welled in the eyes of social worker Shoichi Tatsuta when he recalled the sudden deterioration of COVID-19 patients at their homes, the filthy apartments of those too sick to move, and the unanswered pleas of sobbing family members seeking hospital treatment for their loved ones. Those conditions occurred in Kobe during the fourth wave of novel coronavirus infections. The current wave around the country is spreading at a faster pace, and Tatsuya fears a repeat of the hellish situation he experienced, only worse under the central government’s new hospitalization policy. The policy is to provide hospital care only to COVID-19 patients with serious symptoms or at risk of becoming seriously ill. Hospitals will ask those with moderate or less severe symptoms to recuperate at home. Tatsuta, who operates Cosmos, a home-care service provider for seniors in Kobe, said low-risk patients can quickly take a turn for the worse while recuperating at home, and by then, it may be too late to save them. “There were many patients who developed severe pneumonia requiring immediate hospitalization but were not admitted to a hospital until just before their deaths,” he said. More than 15,000 COVID-19 patients had to stay home without access to hospital care in Osaka Prefecture at the peak of the fourth wave. In neighboring Hyogo Prefecture, of which Kobe is the capital, the number topped 1,800. Aside from those patients, 1,900 infected people in Kobe were in talks with public health officials to find hospital beds or rooms in designated hotels. The corresponding number was 3,500 in Osaka Prefecture. CRYING WITH FAMILY MEMBERS Tatsuta, 35, and a nurse visited the homes of seniors and disable people infected with the novel coronavirus between late March and late June on a program commissioned by the Kobe city government and public hospitals. He said the rooms of some patients were covered in garbage and vomit. One motionless patient groaned, “It hurts” and “I feel terrible.” Another patient repeatedly asked Tatsuta, “Am I dying?” Tatsuta and the nurse visited around 25 homes without a break from 7 a.m. to the late evening each day. After the visits, he compiled a report on each patient. But his work did not end there. He often received phone calls after midnight from at-home patients saying their condition had worsened. Some callers were terrified by what was happening to them. Workers at a public health center also called him late at night. One of his duties as a provider of home-visit nursing care is to report the health conditions of the patients to a public health center. Public health center workers are in charge of deciding which patients should be hospitalized and finding beds for them. As of April 26, 1,899 COVID-19 patients were on a waiting list for hospital beds in Kobe, including many whose blood-oxygen levels had dropped and were showing serious symptoms of pneumonia. Hospitals could not accept them because they were already flooded with patients. Some relatives of patients who were suffering at home took out their frustrations on Tatsuta. “Why can’t my husband be admitted to a hospital? You must not have reported his condition properly to the public health center,” one woman snapped at him. Tatsuta said there was little he could do to ease their anger. He just had to endure it. Even if his patients finally found a hospital for treatment, it was often too late. One doctor told Tatsuta that his patient “likely won’t last long.” In some cases, he had to tell the patients’ families that the medical facilities had no ventilators or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, expensive breathing-assisting equipment that require specially trained staff to constantly monitor the patient’s condition. Some family members sobbed after learning that their relatives could not receive the best possible treatment, even as their chances for survival were becoming slim. “I cried with families together when I started this program,” Tatsuta said. “But I had to later numb my emotions to keep doing my work.” One elderly female patient hoped to receive hospital treatment, but she gave up the idea because all of the hospital beds were filled. Although a doctor visited her home to provide some treatment, her condition rapidly worsened. She ended up in great pain and could not take medicine. She was finally admitted to a hospital but died within hours of her arrival. Tatsuta said he was aware that she would probably would not make it. All he could do was pray that she would “die peacefully.” Of the patients he visited during the fourth wave of infections, about 40 were taken to hospitals after their conditions rapidly deteriorated. Twenty-five of them died. New COVID-19 cases have fast resurged in Kobe since late July. As of Aug. 2, the number of patients recuperating at home had almost tripled to 608 over just one week. Tokyo, Osaka and other major cities have also seeing surges in new cases in recent weeks, caused largely by the highly contagious Delta variant. Tokyo and three surrounding prefectures, as well as Osaka Prefecture and Okinawa Prefecture, are currently under a state of emergency until the end of August. The government also decided on the new COVID-19 hospitalization policy on Aug. 2 to prevent a collapse in health care systems in hard-hit areas. The health ministry defines patients requiring ventilators or treatment at ICUs as “serious” cases. Patients who suffer shortness of breath and are confirmed to have pneumonia or require oxygen inhalation are categorized as “moderate” cases. Those with no respiratory symptoms other than coughing are placed in the “mild” category. Infected people with “moderate” or “mild” symptoms will be asked to recover at home under the new policy, meaning an increase in the number of COVID-19 patients outside of hospitals. “It is understandable in some respects because the number of hospital beds is limited,” Tatsuta said of the policy change. But he warned against assessing cases as “low risk” based on initial symptoms. “Even if they are considered at low risk of suffering severe illness, I have seen patients whose conditions suddenly worsened,” he said. Tatsuta called on local governments to set up a system to dispatch doctors and nurses to patients’ homes and to deliver meals and other necessities if patients are denied access to hospital treatment. DEATH CAME OUT OF NOWHERE A man in his 60s who was hospitalized for COVID-19 said he remains traumatized by the solitary death of his mother at her home after she contracted the virus. The man, who lives in Kobe, called her mobile phone around noon on April 21 from his hospital but received no answer. Although she usually immediately answered such calls, he did not suspect anything serious had happened. She had shown only minor symptoms and appeared to be faring all right. But that night, emergency responders discovered her body near her bed. A nurse had called them after the mother did not answer the doorbell. “My mother was abandoned without treatment,” the man said. His infection was confirmed on April 13. His mother tested positive on April 17. On April 20, health workers contacted him about his hospitalization after he developed a high fever, became unable to eat and vomited repeatedly. He vaguely remembered that his mother called him about his condition that night. His last words to his mother were, “I will call you back later.” The Kobe city government said officials were trying to find a hospital for her. When they called her on the morning of April 20, she showed no serious symptoms. Her temperature was between 35 and 36 degrees. She did say her appetite had decreased, but she had enough water, according to city officials. The son said he still cannot believe that she died. She was well enough to shop, visit a hospital and attend culture lessons. “Her death came out of nowhere,” he said. “It feels like a relative suddenly died in a traffic accident.” He made an impassioned plea for local governments to improve the system to cope with the pandemic. “Local authorities should build a health care system that allows as many patients as possible to be hospitalized,” he said. “They should also exhaust all measures to protect the lives of those without access to hospital care.”",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14410747

The ministry on Aug. 2 posted the names of three on its website for failing to report their health conditions and other information after entering Japan as required to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus. The ministry has had many such cases, but it made the names of noncompliant entrants public for the first time because the three failed to answer phone calls from authorities and gave no justifiable reasons for doing so. Two are residents of Kumamoto and Saitama prefectures who are both in their 20s and entered Japan from South Korea on July 21. The other thirtysomething arrived from the United States the same day and lives in Tokyo. All tested negative for the virus upon arrival. Under the quarantine law, all entrants to Japan are required to self-isolate at home or other accommodation facilities for two weeks. They also need to provide information, such as their health conditions and location data, to authorities daily through an app during the period. The government also asks entrants to submit a written pledge in which they consent to the release of their names if they fail to send the required reports.

0,"Retailing, food sectors forced to close outlets due to virus",['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"August 3, 2021 at 18:25 JST"," Outbreaks of cluster infections are forcing retailers and food store operators to temporarily close outlets one after another as the highly contagious Delta variant of the novel coronavirus sweeps through the country and takes its toll on staff. But the extent to which those sectors are affected by the virus remains unclear as only a fraction of companies appear willing to go to public about closures due to COVID-19 or cases of infection among staff. “If officials with public health centers conclude that customers did not face any risk of contracting the virus from infected employees, some (food stores) would not announce their cases,” said an official with a leading restaurant chain. All floors of Hanshin Department Store’s Umeda main outlet near busy Osaka Station were closed July 31 and Aug. 1 after 97 employees tested positive for the virus. The outlet partially reopened on Aug. 2, but not the food floors, where most of the infections occurred. The store operator explained that was because results of PCR tests had not come back for all of its 2,000 or so employees, including 1,500 who staff the food floors, by Aug. 1. In addition to setting up counters for customers to disinfect their hands, the store monitored the temperature of each customer on arrival and refused entry to those with a reading of 37.5 degrees or higher. Officials said they made sure that all members of staff strictly follow safety protocol by wearing face masks, regularly disinfecting their hands and having their temperatures taken. All employees are required to eat alone on their break and prohibited from chatting with colleagues unless they are wearing masks. They were also discouraged from taking business trips or attending group dinners after work. Officials fear they may have a serious case of cluster infection on their hands despite the precautionary measures in place. “Delta may be responsible for this cluster. This is scary because we don't have a clue how this happened,” said a store representative. The store now operates the outlet's air ventilation system around the clock instead of only during operating hours. Starbucks Coffee Japan had temporarily closed 21 outlets as of Aug. 2 after members of staff tested positive for the virus. The number of outlets forced to shut temporarily due to infections among employees had hovered at one or two since last spring until late July when the pandemic went up another notch. The figure is now five or so daily. Many outlets are forced to shut due staff shortages triggered by the health crisis. Starbucks Coffee Japan, in its guidelines, directs employees to stay home for two weeks if they had worked with an infected individual in the lead-up to that person displaying COVID-19 symptoms. The company said it insists on closing outlets temporarily even if a public health center considers it is not necessary. McDonald’s Japan had suspended operations at six of its outlets as of Aug. 2, citing coronavirus cases among employees. Operators of supermarket chains have a heightened sense of alarm over coronavirus virus infections among employees. A company that operates 300 or so stores in the Tokyo metropolitan area and the Kansai region said infections among its workforce had hovered at around 10 a day since late July. So far, no outlets were forced to close. “It is possible the virus was transmitted to employees by their family and other sources unrelated to their job,” a company representative said. Another company that operates a supermarket chain in Tokyo and neighboring prefectures said infections among staff began to rise in tandem with skyrocketing cases in the capital. Any outlet where an infection is confirmed is thoroughly disinfected after the store has closed for the day and staff are brought in the next day from other stores to make up for the shortfall. “To remain open is our mission as a supermarket is a lifeline,” said a company official.

0,‘Serious COVID cases only’ policy for hospitals draws fire,['By JUN TABUSHI/ Staff Writer'],"August 3, 2021 at 18:07 JST"," The government’s new policy of providing hospital treatment only for COVID-19 patients in serious condition or at high risk of becoming severely ill has sparked criticism that other infected people are being “abandoned.” The Suga administration decided on Aug. 2 to ask prefectures to impose the new hospitalization policy in areas with surging numbers of novel coronavirus infections to prevent the medical system from collapsing. Patients with mild or moderate symptoms are currently hospitalized, but they will be asked to recuperate at home, in principle, if they are considered at low risk of developing serious symptoms. Those with mild or no symptoms will no longer be allowed to recuperate at hotels or other accommodation facilities unless they are likely to infect family members at home. Novel coronavirus infections, led by the Delta variant, are spreading at an unprecedented speed around Japan. “The health care system is facing a greater strain, particularly in Tokyo,” Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga said at an Aug. 2 meeting with relevant Cabinet ministers, including health minister Norihisa Tamura and Yasutoshi Nishimura, the state minister of economic revitalization, who is also in charge of the government’s novel coronavirus measures. The health ministry defines patients requiring ventilators or treatment at ICUs as “serious” cases. Patients who suffer shortness of breath and are confirmed to have pneumonia or require oxygen inhalation are categorized as “moderate” cases. Those who have no respiratory symptoms other than coughing are placed in the “mild” category. In past waves of infections, a number of patients recuperating at home died after their conditions suddenly worsened. To prevent a repeat, the central government will urge local governments to strengthen monitoring of patients at their homes. It will promote online medical examinations and distribute pulse oximeters, which can measure blood oxygen levels. The government will pay an additional 9,500 yen ($87) in treatment fees to doctors if they visit patients resting at home or other accommodation facilities. Prefectural governments will decide whether their jurisdictions fall under areas with spikes in new COVID-19 cases. The health ministry said it will allow local authorities to implement the changes according to their needs. Yukio Edano, leader of the main opposition Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan, described the government’s new hospitalization policy as “unbelievable” at the party’s meeting on Aug. 3. “The government says it will ask patients (at low risk of becoming seriously ill) to recuperate at home, but that effectively means it is abandoning them,” Edano said. “The government has repeatedly assured the public that they are ‘safe and secure.’ And it suddenly says it can no longer provide hospital treatment to patients even if they have moderate symptoms. “I feel strong resentment toward this lack of crisis management.” Akira Koike, head of the Japanese Communist Party’s Secretariat, tweeted on Aug. 2 that the changes to the hospitalization policy are unacceptable because the government made the decision without convening the Diet or hearing experts’ opinions. The surge in infections has already put a heavy strain on health care systems around the country.

0,"Despite Suga’s pledge, only 75% of seniors got both jabs",['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"August 3, 2021 at 17:06 JST"," Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga was crowing only the other day that he had met his pledge made three months ago to ensure that all senior citizens aged 65 and older would be vaccinated against COVID-19 if they wanted to. It turns out he was way wrong. At a July 30 news conference, Suga said, “For senior citizens who are at greater risk of developing serious symptoms, I believe we have been able to meet our goal.” Suga announced April 23 that the government was seeking to complete giving two jabs each to older individuals by the end of July. But according to the Cabinet Secretariat website, which displays the number of people who have been inoculated, 86.2 percent of those aged 65 and older had only received one jab as of July 31 while 75.5 percent had gotten the prescribed two. Officials said the actual percentage could be slightly higher than the figures on the Cabinet Secretariat website because the numbers are based on entries into the government’s vaccination data base by local governments and medical institutions. Some entries may be inputted days after the fact. When asked how the government would define the completion of vaccinations for different age groups, a high-ranking official in the prime minister’s office snapped, “When we stop receiving new reservations for vaccinations.” But a large number of senior citizens still have reservations for jabs in August, so it remains unclear when the process will be completed. Vaccinations of senior citizens began on April 12. Another milestone Suga set--1 million jabs a day--was reached by the end of June, but the haste to set up vaccination programs at workplaces and universities led to shortages of vaccines around the nation, forcing many local governments to stop accepting reservations as they were unsure how many doses they would have on hand. The more virulent Delta strain, which is now predominant, is cited as the primary cause of the recent surge in COVID-19 cases around Japan. With more patients in their 40s and 50s developing serious symptoms, Suga set a new goal of having 40 percent of the entire population receiving two vaccine doses by late August. Taro Kono, the state minister in charge of administrative reform who also is coordinating the vaccination program within the central government, is expected this week to announce the delivery schedule for vaccines in September. That will give local governments a better grasp of how many reservations they can take. However, the process of vaccinating the entire Japanese population is still at a crawl compared with other advanced nations. As of Aug. 1, officials said 34.5 percent of all Japanese had received one jab, while only about 24.6 percent had gotten the full two doses.

0,Olympic ‘watch parties’ turn Tokyo parks into booze fests,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"July 31, 2021 at 18:22 JST"," Millions of people in Tokyo are staying home glued to their TVs to watch the Olympics, but plenty of others are partying away in parks each night, swigging cans of booze as they cheer the latest medal tallies by Japanese athletes. This is the reality of the expanded state of emergency declared by the government as COVID-19 cases continue to skyrocket. Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga insists that his unpopular decision to go ahead with the Olympics at the height of the pandemic has nothing to do with the surge in new infections. Rather, the Games are helping to contain the health crisis, Suga and his aides contend. Yasutoshi Nishimura, the state minister heading the government's efforts to grapple with the health crisis, stated, “We face an extremely tough situation as infections are spreading widely” while addressing a Lower House committee meeting July 30 on the latest COVID-19 surge. The number of new cases nationwide hit a record 10,743 that day. But in the same breath, Nishimura said, “As many people watch the Olympics at home, the movement of people has slowed down since July 20.” He also noted that TV ratings for Olympic-related programs “remain high, which is an indication that many people are staying home and watching the Games.” Suga held a news conference that evening to announce that the emergency curbs are being extended until the end of August and expanded to cover the four prefectures of Chiba, Saitama, Kanagawa and Osaka. He reiterated that his government is doing everything it can to bring the crisis under control while the Olympics are being staged. He mentioned efforts to regulate traffic and exhortations to companies to allow employees to telework as much as possible. Suga said these efforts are in fact paying off in terms of reducing the number of people going out in nightlife districts in Tokyo. But in reality, parks in central Tokyo are packed every night with youngsters and others holding “Olympics watch parties” with friends while downing cans of alcohol purchased at convenience stores. Bars and restaurants around trendy JR Harajuku Station in the capital's Shibuya Ward have been complying with metropolitan government requests since emergency curbs were re-imposed July 12 to turn off their lights at 8 p.m. Spacious Yoyogi Park is nearby, and it immediately became a magnet for people to gather after dark with plastic bags packed with food, snacks and drinks purchased at convenience stores. The park initially was intended to be one of the capital's official public viewing sites for the Tokyo Olympics. But that idea was scrapped in early June due to the pandemic. On the evening of July 30, when Japan’s gold medal count hit an all-time Olympic record of 17, hordes of young people occupied spaces in the popular park. Signs erected all over the park say, “Please refrain from drinking alcohol.” Loads of youngsters paid no attention, many sitting right next to the signs, chatting, drinking and laughing away. A man in his 20s came to the park with a friend from his university days to drink. He said he was well aware of the spike in COVID-19 cases but it did not matter because “the park is well ventilated.” The IT company he works for maintains a teleworking policy for its employees. As a result, the man said he had not been to a drinking party for more than a year. This occasion was extra special because it was the first time for the two friends to “have drinks together face to face.” So special that he purchased sushi to share that cost 10,000 yen ($91). In another corner at the park, a 30-year-old woman downed wine with three coworkers. They sat on a tarp as one of them held up a smartphone to watch Olympic events together. “We wanted to get a feel of a public viewing party,” the woman said. Still, it was rather a subdued one. “I really wish we could do whoops and high-fives,” she lamented. Another “watch party” was going on at Miyashita Park near JR Shibuya Station the same evening. By 9:20 p.m., approximately 350 people had packed the park, which is situated on the rooftop of a commercial facility. All of the benches set up in the park were occupied. Young women were busy talking about their latest romances. Non-Japanese sat in a circle and partied away. Many of the participants that evening did not bother to wear masks. Two university students, aged 20 and 21, arrived at the park after a meal at an “izakaya” restaurant. They sat on the ground and watched an Olympic fencing event on a smartphone. When the Japanese team won a gold medal, they screamed, “A medal!! On streets near the park, young skateboarders were honing their skills. A 21-year-old man, holding his board, said the Olympics “are hot!” He mentioned Yuto Horigome, the Japanese skateboarder who won skateboarding’s first Olympic gold on July 25. “He is on a way different level!” the man said in awe.

The estimated figure was presented that day at a meeting of the Tokyo metropolitan government’s expert panel monitoring the spread of the novel coronavirus in the capital. Experts at the meeting called for a need to quickly respond to the situation to prevent infections from continuing to increase at the current pace. They also said the number of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 has doubled over the month, already placing a heavy strain on the health care system. The capital’s daily average of new infection cases over the week through July 28 was 1,936, up 1.53 times from the 1,268 recorded a week earlier, according to data shared at the meeting. Norio Omagari, director of the Disease Control and Prevention Center under the National Center for Global Health and Medicine, estimated that the figure will reach 2,962 on Aug. 4 and 4,532 on Aug. 11 if infections keep rising at the current pace. “That will put the health care system at risk of collapse, so we must act quickly to avert it (the scenario),” he said. The panel also reported that the highly contagious Delta variant was responsible for 46.3 percent of new infections confirmed by diagnostic tests conducted in Tokyo over the week through July 18. The figure was up from 30.6 percent a week earlier. “Tokyo will face an explosive growth in infections if it fails to sufficiently reduce the flow of people and allows infections from the Delta variant to further replace those from other strains of the virus,” Omagari said. Data presented at the meeting also showed that 3,039 people were hospitalized with COVID-19 in the capital as of July 29, double the figure from a month ago. The panel also noted that the metropolitan government received 270 requests a day from local public health centers over the week through July 28 to find hospitals that could take in COVID-19 patients. The figure jumped from the 184 recorded a week earlier. Officials had difficulty arranging hospitalizations, particularly during the four-day holiday weekend that ended on July 25, forcing many patients to wait at home, according to Masataka Inokuchi, vice chair of the Tokyo Medical Association. He said the situation has remained the same even after the weekend and that it will likely become even more difficult for officials to make arrangements for patients’ hospitalizations.

IOC officials said some buses did not show up to pick up the athletes as scheduled or went to the wrong destinations. According to sources, one competitor missed a training session because a bus was delayed. In another case, a bus did not arrive on time, so an athlete took a taxi to the training venue, even though such cab use could violate protocols of the COVID-19-prevention “bubble.” Many bus drivers were brought in from outside the capital to work at the Olympic Games. Tokyo organizing committee officials said such drivers may be unfamiliar with roads in the city. In addition, the committee cited botched operations in arranging an appropriate number of buses for peak times of the athletes’ movements. According to sources, IOC officials strongly demanded the Tokyo committee improve the transportation system during a meeting on July 27. “The organizing committee should stick to the athletes’ schedules, not its own,” an IOC official said.

0,Young people told to get shots that are largely unavailable,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"July 30, 2021 at 15:30 JST"," Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike’s calls for young people to get vaccinated against COVID-19 have exacerbated frustrations over the shortages of doses in the capital. Tokyo keeps setting daily records for the number of newly confirmed infections, and a growing percentage of the new patients are in the younger age groups. Koike has been urging young people to help stem the increase by getting vaccinated. A 34-year-old company employee in Kokubunji, western Tokyo, was flabbergasted by Koike’s remarks. He said he would surely comply, if he could. “To say ‘get vaccinated’ when there are no vaccines available shows that she has no understanding of the situation at the local level,” the man said. The Kokubunji city government has been inoculating its residents from the oldest age groups, and it has not yet gotten around to vaccinating those 39 and younger. A 27-year-old employee residing in Tokyo’s Setagaya Ward agreed with the message that Koike was trying to get across, but the lack of vaccines has made fulfilling her request difficult. He received a vaccine voucher from the ward government about 10 days ago, but reservations have already been filled. Of the record 3,865 COVID-19 cases reported in Tokyo on July 29, 36.7 percent were patients in their 20s and 20.2 percent were in their 30s. A 28-year-old company employee living in Meguro Ward has already been told by his family living in Saitama Prefecture not to bother returning to the family home for the Bon holidays in August. However, the man is one of the lucky ones. He made a reservation for a vaccine shot in early August through his workplace. Moreover, his wife also received a vaccine ticket for spouses from her workplace, so technically the man can get four doses. The situation made the man think that “vaccines are not going to where they are needed.” Given the increase in younger people being infected, local governments in Tokyo have switched to inoculating residents in lower age groups, but the lack of vaccines has hampered their efforts. For example, the Shinjuku Ward government has placed priority on getting residents in their 20s and 30s vaccinated, and it began taking reservations on July 7. But with not enough doses to go around, only 14 percent of residents in those two age groups had received their first dose as of July 27. The ward government is still seeking to inoculate all residents by the end of November. “We will not reach that goal at the current rate, but there is nothing we can do since there are no vaccines” said one official handling vaccinations in the ward. The Suginami Ward government has implemented a similar measure for its residents aged between 12 and 39. But of the 180,000 or so in that age bracket, only about 95,000 have been jabbed so far. Reservations for the 170,000 or so Suginami residents between 40 and 59 began on July 14, but with only enough doses for 20,000 residents, all available slots were filled in about two hours. The Setagaya Ward government, also facing a major shortage of vaccines, has turned to the Rakuten Inc. group, which is headquartered in the ward, for a cooperative effort. Rakuten has started a vaccination program for its employees, and under the new arrangement, Setagaya residents 18 and older can also get their shots there. However, the program will still not completely cover the shortage of vaccines. Setagaya Mayor Nobuto Hosaka said he hoped the Tokyo metropolitan government would make greater efforts to negotiate with the central government for more doses.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14407036

0,Tokyo sukiyaki restaurant open over 140 years to shut due to virus,['By YUKI KASHIWAGI/ Staff Writer'],"July 30, 2021 at 08:00 JST"," The boisterous conversations are coming to an end at a sukiyaki restaurant with a 140-plus-year history in Tokyo’s Asakusa district, which will shut its doors after a plunge in business its owner blames on the COVID-19 pandemic. “Sukiyaki essentially shortens the distance between eaters to put them closer to one another,” said Fumihiko Sumiyoshi, 55, the sixth-generation manager of the Chin-ya sukiyaki shop. “But what makes sukiyaki appealing worked against it in the coronavirus crisis.” Chin-ya, located along a street facing the iconic Kaminarimon gate at Sensoji temple since the early Meiji Era (1868-1912), is set to shut on Aug. 15. The operators of the long-running established restaurant, which prided itself on bringing people closer through its communal dish served in a pot, say the decision to close was clinched by the government's COVID-19 policy that warns citizens to avoid the “three Cs” of closed, crowded and close-contact settings. Though the restaurant boasted a nostalgic ambiance, it had fallen too far behind the times. Plummeting customer numbers during the pandemic, however, ended up nixing the plan to refurbish the eatery. Its name, Chin-ya, comes from the building's use during the Edo Period (1603-1867) as a veterinary clinic that delivered Japanese spaniels, called ""chin,"" and other pets to daimyo feudal lords and wealthy merchants. The name stuck even after the building turned into a restaurant in 1880. Following the Meiji Restoration in 1868 that brought down the Tokugawa Shogunate and restored imperial rule, Fukuzawa Yukichi (1835-1901) and other cultural figures frequented beef pot restaurants. Beef pot became a fashionable food, and Tokyo is said to have been home to nearly 500 beef pot stores in 1877, situated mainly in Asakusa. The meal’s Kansai-style name, sukiyaki, later spread, and Chin-ya in 1903 started exclusively providing it. Many ukiyo-e paintings depicting cultural items connected to Japan’s Westernization still remain on display inside Chin-ya. SERVING THREE GENERATIONS Sumiyoshi, who became Chin-ya’s manager in 2001, had a prime spot to assess how customers reacted to the restaurant: He has spent long periods at its entrance collecting their shoes after they took them off to go inside. “I met customers as they arrived and were going home, so I could tell how happy they were by how they left,” he said. While people typically eat sukiyaki to celebrate special occasions, many also come to Chin-ya after memorial services, grave visits and other Buddhist rituals since there are many temples around Asakusa. Sumiyoshi carefully arranged details of the restaurant to create “lasting memories” for families and friends who dined there. His efforts paid off. Sumiyoshi recounted seeing regulars who had frequented Chin-ya over three generations pop in for a bite with relatives from the next generation in tow, who said they had come to eat at “the place our grandpa loved.” Another group of customers used to get together in front of the restaurant and enjoy sukiyaki every Jan. 3 without making a reservation. They were former colleagues at a company that had located in the neighborhood, he said. But the group thinned out year after year. Several years ago, only a single person showed up and they didn't order sukiyaki, saying, “Eating it by myself would just make me feel lonely.” “I should have made more effort to talk the customer into eating with us,” regretted Sumiyoshi, recalling the retreating figure. In 2008, Sumiyoshi began organizing a conference bringing together more than 50 sukiyaki restaurant operators from across the nation. There had been no sukiyaki business associations, so for many it was the first time to meet another operator of a sukiyaki restaurant. The event has since been happening several occasions a year with different shops holding it in rotation. “The gathering is very exciting as we aggressively discuss topics like a certain Welsh onion,” said Sumiyoshi, jokingly, adding, “This, however, must generate a considerable amount of carbon dioxide and droplets of saliva.” HOPES FOR A REBOOT The current restaurant's building was constructed in 1975. Its wooden frames have warped so badly now that its windows won't open. On hot days, the overheated air conditioning system stops. With no end to troubles like these, the arrival of the coronavirus pandemic ended up dealing the final blow to Chin-ya. “Right now, restaurants themselves are seen as evil,” Sumiyoshi lamented. “When you eat sukiyaki, people sit with their knees close to one another so all of them can reach the pot. You eat while talking energetically. 'Oh, this has not boiled well,’ someone says, or ‘This looks nice.’ ""Sukiyaki makes for a pleasant meal as it brings people closer mentally and toward the end of it people are more friendly."" But Sumiyoshi made up his mind to shut down the restaurant and sell the building and in late June he mailed a “notification of closure” letter to regulars of the eatery. Since then, he has received a flood of inquires. Though Chin-ya will close, its managing firm will be kept operational, with the possibility of reviving and restarting the restaurant in some form someday. “I'm not giving up,"" said Sumiyoshi. ""I'm looking forward to that day."" In the meantime, he added, he would be singing Kyu Sakamoto's 1960s hit song ""Sukiyaki.""",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14395929

Seventeen are those who live in Japan, according to the committee. A total of 193 people related to the Games have contracted the virus. According to Tokyo metropolitan government officials, the seven-day average of new cases in the capital reached a record high of 2,224.1 on July 29, up 61.9 percent from the figure a week ago. The previous high was 1,954.7, which was recorded the day before. Among the 3,865 new cases, 1,417 were in their 20s, followed by 782 in their 30s, 612 in their 40s, and 407 in their 50s. There were 323 patients between the ages of 10 and 19, while 105 were 65 or older. Infections are surging elsewhere in Japan as well. In Tokyo's neighboring Kanagawa Prefecture, officials confirmed a record 1,164 new infections. Okinawa Prefecture meanwhile confirmed a record 392 new cases on July 29. The number of new cases per 100,000 people over the past week was 94.46 for the southern island prefecture, second only to Tokyo. At a July 29 meeting of a panel that monitors the infection situation for the Tokyo metropolitan government, officials estimated that the weekly average of new infections per day will reach 4,532 on Aug. 11.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14406423

The highly contagious Delta variant of the novel coronavirus has led not only to record infection figures in the Tokyo metropolitan area but is apparently also spreading elsewhere around the nation. Just the previous day in the capital, 2,848 new infections were confirmed, smashing the earlier record of 2,520 set on Jan. 7. The total on July 28 not only set another high, but it was also the first time for the figure to exceed 3,000, metropolitan government officials said. N eighboring Kanagawa, Saitama and Chiba prefectures also reported record numbers of new infections, with 1,051, 870 and 577, respectively. On reason for the surge is that more people have been tested for the novel coronavirus this week. Most medical institutions were closed between July 22 and July 25 because two holidays were added to the weekend for the opening of the Tokyo Olympics. Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike said on July 28 that the virus is spreading fast among young people, and some of them have developed serious symptoms. In contrast, the number of infected people aged 65 or older has declined, she said, apparently because they received priority in the vaccination program. “Please ensure that you stay home unless you have something absolutely necessary to do outside, and thoroughly follow COVID-19 safety protocols,” she said. The governor also called on young people to get vaccinated. In Hokkaido, 227 people were newly confirmed infected. It was the first time in about two months for the number on the northern main island to exceed 200. Ishikawa Prefecture in central Japan also posted a high of 119 new infections. In Osaka Prefecture, the infection tally reached 798, topping 700 for two straight days. Okinawa Prefecture confirmed 347 new COVID-19 cases, the second consecutive day for the figure to exceed 300 in the southern island prefecture. According to Tokyo metropolitan government officials, the seven-day average of new cases in the capital reached a record high of 1,954.7 on July 28, up 53 percent from the figure a week ago. The previous high was 1,861.1, which was recorded on Jan. 11 in the third wave of infections. The seven-day average was 523.1 on July 1, but it has since shot up, topping 1,000 on July 17 and 1,500 on July 26. These figures indicate that Tokyo is now in the grip of the largest wave of infections so far at a time when the once-delayed Olympics are well under way in the capital. Chief Cabinet Secretary Katsunobu Kato on July 28 did not give a direct answer when asked by a reporter if Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga still believes that staging the Summer Games in the current virus situation is not problematic. Suga had earlier ruled out the possibility of canceling the Games despite the increase in infections in Tokyo. The reporter referred to Suga’s remark at a June 7 Diet session that his decision on whether to hold the Olympics will be made on the premise of protecting people’s health and lives as a top priority. “The central government has imposed various safety measures,” Kato said. “There has been a decline, albeit slow, in the number of people staying out at night, compared with the last state of emergency.” He also said the central government is not aware of any reports of Olympians or officials having developed serious symptoms after being infected.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14405353
0,Backlash forces government to retract 10% cut in vaccine supply,['By JUNYA SAKAMOTO/ Staff Writer'],"July 28, 2021 at 18:15 JST"," The central government is backtracking on a planned reduction in the supply of Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine to local governments with excess stock after the municipalities pushed back. Taro Kono, the administrative reform minister who is in charge of the COVID-19 vaccine rollout, said on July 27 that the government decided it would not cut the supply of the vaccine, jointly developed by U.S. pharmaceutical company Pfizer Inc. and its German partner, BioNTech, for the latter half of August. Osaka, Nagoya and other municipalities targeted for the cut in Pfizer shipments for the first half of August had bristled over the cutback and called on the central government to reconsider. Kono said he heard from municipalities that they cannot predict how many vaccine doses will be delivered if the central government reduces the supply at the last minute. “A drop in the base supply could force municipalities to give up on allocating the doses to some of the places they planned to,” he said. The central government had previously said it would ship about 11.7 million doses of the Pfizer vaccine every two weeks in August and September, and distribute 80 percent of the doses as a “base supply” to prefectural governments in proportion to their populations. The government subsequently decided to cut Pfizer shipments by 10 percent for local governments with more than six weeks’ worth of excess stock to deal with a supply crunch. Kono said on July 7 that the reduction in vaccine supply would start with the shipment for the first half of August. But he announced at a news conference on July 21 that the central government would leave all the decisions on allocating the Pfizer doses to municipalities up to prefectural governments from September onward. The central government moved the schedule forward by announcing it would effectively retract the planned cut in vaccine shipments for the latter half of August. Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga asked Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla to provide some of the 20 million doses of the vaccine to Japan in October and November ahead of schedule during their meeting on July 23, according to an official close to the prime minister. Kono also revealed the National Governors’ Association on July 27 reported the inoculation program for health care workers, who have been vaccinated as a top priority group since mid-February, has been completed. “All prefectures had finished inoculating health care workers by July 23,” he said.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14405207
0,Conflicting views given on whether Tokyo is nearing a COVID-19 crisis,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"July 28, 2021 at 15:45 JST"," Government officials and health experts differed on the severity of the recent surge in COVID-19 cases in Tokyo and the possible effects on medical care facilities in the capital. Tokyo reported a record high 2,848 new COVID-19 cases on July 27, continuing the trend of rising numbers under the latest state of emergency. “If this pace continues, normal medical care will be endangered,” said Mitsuru Honda, chairman of the Emergency Medical Care Center at the Toho University Omori Medical Center in the capital’s Ota Ward. He added that while the number of new COVID-19 cases was lower during the four-day weekend from July 22, “the rate at which hospital beds for such patients were being filled shot up sharply.” The medical center has set aside six beds for COVID-19 patients with serious symptoms and 25 for those with mid-level symptoms. By the four-day weekend, five of the beds for seriously ill patients and at least 20 for those with mid-level symptoms had been filled. For Tokyo as a whole, 58 percent of hospital beds for patients with serious symptoms were occupied as of July 26. The number of new cases over the course of a week is at about the same level as the peak figure for the third wave of infections this past winter. But at that time, about 80 percent of hospital beds for COVID-19 patients were filled, while the figure now is about 40 percent. The major reasons for that improvement are the increase in hospital beds capable of taking in such patients as well as the larger number of senior citizens who have been vaccinated. Norihiko Yoshimura, the head of the Tokyo metropolitan government’s Bureau of Social Welfare and Public Health, met with reporters on July 27 and tried to quell concerns about a possible crisis in the medical care system. He explained that the situation now is vastly different from the third wave when about 14 percent of new cases in Tokyo were people 60 and older, the age group at the highest risk of developing severe symptoms. That rate had dropped to 5 percent as of July 27. Yoshimura called on reporters not to needlessly enflame concerns about a crisis. He said about 70 percent of the new cases now were of people under 40 who were at less risk of developing serious symptoms. But there are troubling signs. Shortly after a state of emergency began on Jan. 8, a day after the peak for infections during the third wave, the number of new COVID-19 cases in Tokyo began declining. The latest state of emergency has now been in place for two weeks, and the daily infection figures are not decreasing but rising sharply. Some health experts pointed to the higher pedestrian traffic in major Tokyo entertainment areas as a worrying sign that the increases would continue. “The current level of those milling around at entertainment areas makes it difficult to forecast when the infection spread will be brought under control,” said Atsushi Nishida, head of the Research Center for Social Science and Medicine at the Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Medical Science, which has been conducting studies on pedestrian traffic in the capital. Nishida said a further decline in pedestrian traffic would be needed to lower the number of new cases, given that the highly contagious Delta variant is now having a larger impact. The Tokyo metropolitan government’s definition of COVID-19 patients with serious symptoms also clouds the picture of the medical care structure. Only patients using ventilators and other assisted-breathing equipment are defined as having serious symptoms. Under that definition, Tokyo had 82 COVID-19 patients in serious condition as of July27. But the health ministry also includes patients treated in intensive care units as having serious symptoms. If the ministry’s definition is used, Tokyo had 676 seriously ill COVID-19 patients as of July 25.

Chiba Governor Toshihito Kumagai said his request could come as early as July 28. “Considering the latest infection situation in my prefecture, I decided to proceed to make the request,” Kumagai said on July 27. The three prefectures are currently administering pre-emergency measures, but novel coronavirus infections continue to spread. Japan confirmed 7,629 new COVID-19 cases on July 27, the fourth highest figure. Tokyo, which is already under a state of emergency while it hosts the Summer Olympics, reported 2,848 new cases on July 27, shattering the previous daily high of 2,520 set on Jan. 7 during the third wave of infections. Chiba Prefecture set a record with 509 new cases on July 26, and reported 405 on the following day. Saitama also reported a record 593 new cases on July 27 while Kanagawa Prefecture confirmed 758 new cases on the same day. Osaka Prefecture logged 741 new cases while Okinawa Prefecture’s 354 confirmed infections eclipsed its previous record of 335 set on May 29. Fukuoka Prefecture reported 236 new cases, topping 200 for the first time since May 26. Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga held a meeting with health minister Norihisa Tamura and other Cabinet ministers on July 27 to discuss anti-virus measures. One minister suggested that the state of emergency be expanded to cover Chiba, Saitama and Kanagawa prefectures, as well as Osaka Prefecture, a source said. Although COVID-19 has been spreading rapidly across the nation, including an increasing number of cases involving the highly contagious Delta variant, Suga ruled out the possibility of canceling the Tokyo Olympics. When asked by reporters about the risk of continuing the world’s bigge st sporting event during an increase in infections, Suga said, “Due to teleworking and restrictions on cars, foot traffic is decreasing, so we don’t need to be worried.”",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14405073

New cases topped 2,000 in the capital for the first time since Jan. 15, when 2,044 were registered. It was the eighth consecutive day that daily new cases in Tokyo topped 1,000. A total of 1,461 more new cases were reported on the day than the same day a week ago. The rolling seven-day average for new infections through July 27 was 1,762.6, an increase of 49.4 percent from the figure for the preceding week. In July, it has become clear that a fifth wave of COVID-19 cases has hit the capital. Tokyo reported 1,149 new cases on July 14, the first time for the daily count to go above 1,000 in about two months. Almost every day since has seen more than 1,000 new cases reported. On July 22, the number hit 1,979, the fifth most to date. On July 26, after the four consecutive holidays arranged for the Tokyo Games, new cases totaled 1,429, the most for any Monday. The seven-day positivity rate was 14.5 percent on July 25, tying the record set on Jan. 7 in the middle of the third wave of infections. Preliminary figures released by the metropolitan government showed that the Delta variant accounted for 30.5 percent of the total of new cases reported over the week through July 11. As Tokyo has been placed under a fourth state of emergency, crowds in its entertainment districts are thinning somewhat, metropolitan officials said. But the pace of infections is expected to accelerate in the coming weeks. Shigeru Omi, chief of the government’s expert panel on response to the coronavirus, has warned that the number of daily new cases could hit nearly 3,000 during the first week of August. Health experts fear that hospitals in Tokyo will likely be overwhelmed by patients with COVID-19 in the coming days.

0,"Lacking doses, hospital feels punished for pushing vaccines",['By NOBUYA SAWA/ Senior Staff Writer'],"July 26, 2021 at 18:46 JST"," KAMAGAYA, Chiba Prefecture--The response to a hospital’s request for four boxes of COVID-19 vaccine doses drew incredulous looks from everyone aware of the situation there. Central government records showed that the hospital surely must have a surplus of doses, so just one box would be provided, they were told. Lacking a sufficient supply, Toho Kamagaya Hospital was forced to suspend the first-shot part of its vaccine program. The problem with the supply chain facing Toho Kamagaya Hospital and other medical facilities around Japan stems largely from another shortage: tablet computers and personnel to register data for each vaccination. The central government’s vaccine supply plans are based largely on data entered through the tablets for the centralized Vaccination Record System (VRS), which is supposed to keep tabs on individual vaccinations and personal information in real time. But many medical facilities have complained that the cumbersome and often complicated VRS data entry process has made the information in the system out of date. The central government, for example, says its VRS data on the distribution of Pfizer vaccines showed that enough doses have been shipped to local governments in Chiba Prefecture, making shortages unlikely. However, the Chiba prefectural government contacted about 700 medical institutions in its jurisdiction on June 24 and asked if they had extra unused doses on hand. Most of the facilities said “no.” Toho Kamagaya, a core hospital in this city of 110,000 people, began giving jabs to seniors in May at the request of a local association of doctors. Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga was pushing for the immunization of all people 65 or older in Japan by the end of July. In June, the hospital provided vaccinations six days a week, and administered more than 2,000 doses a week. The hospital asked for the four boxes in June so that it would have a sufficient number of doses for the period from July 5 to July 18. The Kamagaya city government, which is in charge of distributing vaccines to medical institutions on behalf of the central government, told hospital officials it could supply only one box. Lacking supplies, Toho Kamagaya Hospital had to stop accepting reservations for first shots for residents from July 12. It decided to use its remaining Pfizer doses for second shots, which are usually given three weeks after the first one. “If the central government cannot guarantee supplies, we have a responsibility to secure the second doses,” Hideki Kanai, director of the hospital, said. “The central government is completely mistaken when it says medical institutions are accumulating doses.” TIME-CONSUMING DATA ENTRY The central government distributes a single tablet computer to each medical institution for the VRS system. The tablet scans small 18-digit numbers on the vaccination vouchers to register data. The manual for the tablet states that the device must be about 7.5 centimeters away from the numbers to scan. But maneuvering the tablet to focus on the numbers has proved laborious. A worker assigned to the task at the hospital said that on some days she scanned the numbers for eight nonstop hours. Since only one tablet was provided to each medical institution, only one person at a time can do the scanning. The hospital administered up to 1,200 jabs a day. If it took one minute to register the data for one injection, the tablet user would need 20 hours to complete the task, making it impossible to enter all of the information on the day the shots were given. At one time, data on vaccinations for more than 1,000 people were left unprocessed for several days after the doses were given, according to hospital officials. For that period, the VRS system would show the hospital still had more than 1,000 unused doses. Taro Kono, the administrative reform minister who is in charge of the vaccine rollout, announced that vaccine supplies would be curtailed from July for medical institutions that are slow in registering VRS data. Since then, officials at Toho Kamagaya Hospital have scrambled to arrange for part-time workers to spend all day entering data, rather than half a day, to prevent the hospital from lagging behind in data registration. Hospital staff are also expected to do the paperwork for expense claims for administering shots to the central government at the end of this month. “The amount of preparation for the vaccination program and related paperwork tasks is extraordinary,” Hisako Kawajiri, deputy director of the hospital, said. “The more we vaccinate, the more our workload increases. “Despite all that, we have cooperated with the vaccination campaign. But the central government has now cut vaccines supplies and is blaming medical institutions for the limited supplies. I cannot accept the way it has handled things.”",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14403434

0,OLYMPICS/ Positive COVID-19 test dashes Chilean athlete’s Olympic dreams,['By YU KAMATA/ Staff Writer'],"July 26, 2021 at 18:28 JST"," Chile’s Fernanda Aguirre wished it was all just a bad dream as she watched the Olympic taekwondo matches she was supposed to compete in had she not tested positive for the novel coronavirus. Aguirre, 23, had entered the taekwondo 57-kilogram weight division, but just days ago became the first athlete to withdraw from a competition at the Tokyo Games because of COVID-19. She is currently isolating in a hotel room overlooking the streets of Tokyo. On July 25, when her competition was originally scheduled, she was sitting on a bed, watching a livestream of her rival athletes’ matches online. “It’s painful when I imagine myself competing with them,” Aguirre said in an online interview with The Asahi Shimbun. She arrived in Japan on July 19 and took a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test and an antigen test at the airport, according to the rules set out in the Olympic “playbook” for the Tokyo Games. The result came back positive. Aguirre said she has no idea how or where she contracted the virus. She received her second COVID-19 vaccine shot in April. None of her fellow athletes or her trainers tested positive. She also tested negative in all three PCR tests she took before entering Japan. She currently has no symptoms of COVID-19, nor does she feel ill. But the Chilean Olympic Committee decided that Aguirre would withdraw from the Olympics because she could not participate in the July 25 competition, given the requisite 10-day quarantine period. “The decision threw me into despair,” she said. “I couldn’t stop crying. It was my dream to compete in the Olympics. I spent years preparing for the Games. But all of them came to nothing in an instant.” Aguirre took up taekwondo when she was 8. She said it gave her “peace of mind” as a young tomboy, and that the sense of achievement she had when she earned points at matches motivated her to continue in the sport. Her family also supported her. Her father cheered her on by saying, “You’re the champion.” Her mother made her healthy meals, while her grandmother woke her up every day as she had trouble getting up on time. As a result of her hard work and support from her family, Aguirre landed in the top ranks of a 2019 competition in Central and South America, qualifying her for the Tokyo Olympics. Even after the Games were pushed back a year due to the pandemic, she remained positive, thinking she would be able to spend more time training. She devoted herself to practicing with her coach at a local university. Her tight stomach muscles are a testament to her hard work. “Everything turned upside down,” Aguirre said, wiping her tears away with a towel. She is now confined to a hotel room with two single beds, except for fetching meals at a designated place in the hotel. “I eat exactly the same thing three times a day: rice, noodles and salmon,” she said in a tired voice. Aguirre added that she spends time doing sit-ups and squats in the tiny room, and she uses a translation device when communicating with a nurse who checks on her over the phone. She said her only emotional support is messages of encouragement from her family and friends. She also said she congratulated a Costa Rican athlete on social media who qualified for the Games in place of her. Aguirre will turn 24 on July 29. She would have been enjoying her time in Tokyo as an Olympic athlete. But now, she has no idea when her quarantine will end. “Right now, I just want to go home as quickly as possible,” she said. “I miss my family.”",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14403500
0,Application process starts for Japan’s ‘vaccine passports’,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"July 26, 2021 at 16:54 JST"," Municipalities across Japan on July 26 started accepting applications for “vaccine passports” from people who are fully inoculated against COVID-19 and hope to travel overseas. In general, applicants need to apply at service windows at the municipal government office that issued their vaccination vouchers. Some offices are only accepting applications sent through mail. Vaccination vouchers, vaccination records of the two shots and passports must be included in the applications. The vaccine certificate is an A4-size sheet of paper showing the person’s name, type of vaccine used and the dates of the inoculations. It will be issued free of charge. The idea is that the certificates will exempt travelers from Japan from quarantine and other anti-virus measures after their arrivals in overseas destinations. However, the Japanese government is still not making such exemptions for people who enter Japan with vaccine passports issued by other nations. So far, five countries--Italy, Turkey, Austria, Bulgaria and Poland--have agreed to exempt arriving travelers with the Japanese vaccine certificate from some of their infection-prevention requirements. Italy, for example, will not require such arrivals to remain isolated for 10 days, while Turkey will not require them to submit a certificate of a negative PCR test. In South Korea, the Japanese vaccine passport will be accepted as one of the necessary documents to be exempt from quarantine. Estonia also recognizes the Japanese certificate, but quarantine measures there are not required for travelers, regardless of their vaccination status.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14403429

The capital’s daily tally previously exceeded 1,900 on Jan. 15, when 2,044 cases were reported. The latest figure was up 671 from a week ago and marked the 33rd consecutive day for the daily count of new infections in Tokyo to exceed that of the previous week. The latest tally brought the daily average of new infection cases in the capital over the week through July 22 to 1,373.4, or 155.7 percent of the figure for the preceding week. The number of new infections is expected to increase further in Tokyo and could exceed the all-time high of 2,520, logged on Jan. 7. Shigeru Omi, who heads the government’s expert panel on the COVID-19 pandemic, has recently estimated that the figure will reach nearly 3,000 in the first week of August. The number of serious cases in the capital requiring ventilators or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, also known as an ECMO lung bypass machine, stood at 65 as of July 22. The figure remains low, compared to 160 on Jan. 20, apparently because of a drop in the number of new infections among elderly people, many of whom have been vaccinated against COVID-19.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14401166

0,Hospital beds for virus patients in Tokyo fill to most serious level 4,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"July 22, 2021 at 16:30 JST"," The occupancy rate of hospital beds for COVID-19 patients in serious condition in Tokyo has reached the most severe stage, and scientists warn that the situation could rapidly worsen in the coming weeks. The occupancy rate hit 52 percent, putting that category in gauging the infection spread at stage 4 of a four-level alert under the central government’s standards. Tokyo is also at stage 4 in terms of the number of daily new COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, infected people with nonserious symptoms recuperating at hotels and homes, and the rate of positive tests for the virus, data by the metropolitan government showed. About 2,400 patients with COVID-19 are now hospitalized in the metropolis. The number of patients staying at home because they did not have access to hospital care or because they had mild symptoms soared to 3,657 on July 20, compared with 1,841 a week earlier. If the spread of novel coronavirus infections in Tokyo accelerates from the current pace, the capital will sink into a “crisis” situation in less than two weeks, health experts warned. That future scenario could prove more daunting than the record-setting wave of infections in winter, they said. A big concern in the latest increase is that the highly transmissible and potentially more deadly Delta variant has rapidly replaced other strains, they added. A rolling seven-day average of new infections over the week until July 20 was 1,170, up by 49 percent from 785 for the preceding week. A month ago, the seven-day average to June 21 was 387 new cases. The numbers indicate the novel coronavirus is now sweeping through Tokyo faster than when it pounded the capital in the third wave of infections between late 2020 and early 2021. If the pace continues at the current level, the seven-day average of new infections would reach an estimated 1,743 on July 27 and 2,598 on Aug. 3, health experts said. “The prediction for Aug. 3 would far exceed the peak seven-day average of 1,816 during the third wave of infections,” one of the experts said. The metropolitan government reported 1,832 new cases on July 21, the first time since Jan. 16 for the single-day count to top 1,800. But the official figure for newly confirmed infections in Tokyo may reflect only a fraction of the actual number. In a metropolis with 14 million people, the new COVID-19 cases are recorded from a limited number of tests for the virus. Data from the metropolitan government showed that the three-day average of PCR tests conducted until July 20 was 8,206. Perhaps more telling is that the seven-day average rate of positive results from the PCR tests rose to 10.2 percent as of July 20, up from 7.2 percent for the previous week. The Delta variant accounted for 30.5 percent of the new cases in Tokyo over the week through July 11, according to metropolitan government data. The ratio was 21.5 percent in the previous week. Statistics for the variant are not immediately available because genome sequencing to detect the strain takes time. “We should remain alert about the Delta variant,” a health expert said. Metropolitan government officials reported that crowd sizes in entertainment districts in Tokyo have shrunk slightly since the capital was placed under the fourth state of emergency from July 12. They underscored the need for Tokyo residents to stay home during the four consecutive holidays that began on July 22 to host the Olympic Games. Hiroshi Nishiura, professor of infectious disease epidemiology at Kyoto University, gave a grim prediction at a July 21 meeting of the health ministry’s expert panel on the coronavirus if measures are not taken to minimize the risk of spreading the contagion. He said the number of hospitalized COVID-19 patients in Tokyo could surpass 3,000 in mid-August if the effective reproduction number, or the number of secondary cases caused by one infected person, drops only by 10 percent from the current 1.2. He also said that without improvements in this category, serious cases of COVID-19 will sharply rise. The share of seriously ill patients in their 40s and 50s needing hospital treatment would soar because that age group was given lower priority in the vaccination program, and relatively few of them have been fully inoculated, Nishiura said. On July 22, the metropolitan government was expected to start services at Heisei Tateishi Hospital in Katsushika Ward for people who are battling COVID-19 but have no access to medical care. They can receive oxygen and medications while undergoing other examinations, including electrocardiograms and tests for their blood-oxygen saturation level, an indicator of their lung condition. The service is intended to help patients who cannot find hospital beds because they are rapidly filled up with COVID-19 patients.

0,Group: Use ‘plain Japanese’ in vaccine info for foreign residents,['By TOKO TANAKA/ Staff Writer'],"July 22, 2021 at 07:00 JST"," Many Vietnamese residents are facing language barriers concerning the COVID-19 vaccine program, prompting calls for simpler Japanese in notifications and instructions that non-Japanese speakers can understand. More than 90 percent of Vietnamese in Japan wish to be inoculated against the novel coronavirus, but about 60 percent do not even know the vaccinations are free of charge, a nationwide survey on Vietnamese residents showed. The results were released in June on the Kyoto Medical Practitioners Association website. A group, including Vietnamese doctors working in Kyoto Prefecture, obtained about 2,000 responses through the Vietnamese Embassy and Vietnamese communities in Japan. A combined 70 percent or so of the respondents said they feel “worried” or “very worried” about a shortage of vaccine information designed for foreign residents. Specifically, many of them said they cannot read and understand the notices they receive through the mail at their homes. Many also said they were concerned about possible side-effects from the vaccines. In response to the survey results, the Kyoto Medical Practitioners Association filed requests with the central government and local governments in Kyoto Prefecture to attach multilingual explanatory notes to vaccination vouchers distributed to residents. The association also asked that multilingual helplines and consultation services be made available, and that relevant information be shared on social media. “The unavailability of information on vaccines is a common problem faced by all foreign residents of Japan with language barriers,” said Pham Nguyen Quy, a Vietnamese doctor with the Kyoto Min-iren Chuo Hospital, who helped carry out the survey. The number of respondents doubled when the survey was posted on Taihen Network, a Vietnamese-language information website that is popular among Vietnamese in Japan, he added. “To spread information, public administration services should work with communities of non-Japanese and their support groups, and they should also use social media platforms that are viewed by non-Japanese,” Quy said. Many survey respondents also said they are concerned about possible miscommunication at vaccination venues. This screenshot from Yuko Takeda’s video shows how a typical phrase used at a vaccination venue, “Dangle your arm and ease the tension” (top two lines), can be paraphrased into a Yasashii Nihongo (plain Japanese) equivalent, “Your arm should be like this. Ease the tension” (bottom two lines). (Provided by Juntendo University) Japan was home to 2.89 million foreign residents from 195 countries and regions as of the end of June 2020, meaning that about one in every 40 residents in the country is non-Japanese. While it remains difficult to cover all of the languages, supporters are stressing the use of Yasashii Nihongo (plain Japanese), a set of guidelines for an alternative form of Japanese that can be understood more easily by non-Japanese. Yuko Takeda, a professor of medical education with the Juntendo University graduate school, recently created an animated video to show how phrases typically used at inoculation venues could be said in Yasashii Nihongo. The video, which runs for about two and a half minutes, was posted on YouTube earlier in July for free public viewing. For example, a health care worker may typically tell a vaccine recipient, “Dangle your arm and ease the tension.” A simpler equivalent, accompanied by a demonstrative body movement, is: “Your arm should be like this. Ease the tension.” A statement becomes easier to understand if it is short and does not use onomatopoeic words, such as the one associated with “dangle” in Japanese, Takeda said. “Health care workers use many unfamiliar words,” she added. “The use of Yasashii Nihongo will allow them to be understood better not only by non-Japanese residents but also by Japanese with hearing and comprehension problems and elderly people.” “Health care by Yasashii Nihongo,” a study group led by Takeda, is providing animated videos and a collection of phrases typically used at vaccination venues for free public access on its website ( https://easy-japanese.info/covid19 ).",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14394223

According to the Tokyo metropolitan government’s data, the rolling seven-day average of new cases topped 1,000 on July 17 for the first time since Jan. 27 during the third wave. As of July 18, the week-over-week rise in the seven-day average was 46 percent, a level higher than when Tokyo was placed under the second state of emergency on Jan. 7. If the 46-percent pace continues, the seven-day average of new COVID-19 cases would hit 1,382 on July 23, when the Olympic Opening Ceremony is scheduled to be held, 1,478 on July 24, and 1,560 on July 25. Tokyo’s highest seven-day average for new COVID-19 cases was 1,861, logged on Jan. 11. The current surge of infections could soon overtake that record if the rate of increase surpasses 46 percent. “We are in a very dangerous situation right now,” a metropolitan government official warned at a July 15 meeting on the infection situation in the capital. “You can be infected with the virus anywhere, and once infected, the virus will spread to family members and employees at workplaces.” The seven-day average of new infections week on week began rising fast in July. On July 13, the capital recorded a seven-day average of 791 new cases, up by 30 percent from the week earlier. Five days later, on July 18, the figure was 1,068, an increase of 46 percent. When the second state of emergency was declared for Tokyo on Jan. 7, the week-on-week increase was 42 percent while the seven-day average was 1,261. Hitoshi Oshitani, a professor of infectious diseases at Tohoku University who sits on the central government’s expert panel on the coronavirus, described the 42-percent rise as an “extremely unusual surge from an epidemiological viewpoint.” On Dec. 31, 1,353 daily new infections were confirmed in Tokyo, 392 more than the previous record set a day earlier. The number of new cases continued to soar in the following week,  pushing the health care system in the capital to the brink. Tokyo set a record of 2,520 daily new cases on Jan. 7. Oshitani said the sharp spike in winter can be traced back to a combination of exceptional circumstances in late December and early January. One explanation, he said, is that more people got tested for the virus after year-end parties and other events. Other test-takers were alarmed by the COVID-19 death of Yuichiro Hata, a 53-year-old senior official of the main opposition Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan, in late December. On Jan. 10, the seven-day average of new cases had shot up to 107 percent of the level of the previous week in Tokyo. Different from the third wave of infections, the latest state of emergency was issued for Tokyo relatively early in the surge in cases. And more people have now been vaccinated against the virus.

0,Survey: Suga Cabinet approval rating sinks to record low of 31%,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"July 19, 2021 at 16:46 JST"," The approval rating for the Suga Cabinet dropped to a record-low 31 percent, reflecting increasing frustrations among the public over vaccine shortages and “ineffective” anti-virus measures, an Asahi Shimbun survey showed. The rate was down from 34 percent in the previous survey in June, while the disapproval rating rose to 49 percent from 42 percent, according to the nationwide telephone survey of eligible voters conducted on July 17 and 18. Thirty-five percent of men and 27 percent of women approved the Cabinet, the survey showed. The government’s COVID-19 measures have been criticized since Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga formed the Cabinet in September last year. Amid the latest resurgence of new infections, 65 percent of survey respondents “lowly evaluated” the government’s responses to health crisis, compared with 26 percent who “highly evaluated” them. Concerning the COVID-19 vaccination program, a string of municipalities and workplaces have suspended their vaccination plans because of a shortage of doses. Sixty-three percent of survey respondents thought that “the government is greatly responsible” for the supply problem, while 32 percent said it is “not so much responsible.” Fifty-four percent of respondents “highly evaluated” the government’s vaccination efforts, down from 60 percent in the June survey. For the declaration of the fourth COVID-19 state of emergency for Tokyo, the government asked alcohol wholesalers to halt any dealings with eating and drinking establishments that defy requests to stop serving alcoholic drinks. It also called on financial institutions to urge these businesses to comply with the requests.. After criticism erupted, the government withdrew the requests. These actions “increased” the distrust of the Cabinet among 51 percent of respondents, while 45 percent said their distrust did “not increase so much.” Only 33 percent believe the current state of emergency will be “effective” in preventing the virus from spreading, while 66 percent think the declaration will be “ineffective.” Among voters in Tokyo, where the Olympics will start within days, 74 percent said the state of emergency will be “ineffective.” In the May survey, 41 percent of all respondents said a state of emergency would be “effective.” Suga’s term as president of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party will end in September. Fifty-four percent of respondents said they want Suga to “continue his job until the term ends.” Twenty-seven percent want Suga replaced before his term ends, compared with 14 percent who want him to continue in the post beyond the term, according to the survey. In the April survey, 19 percent wanted him out before the term expires. Among LDP supporters, 63 percent hoped Suga would remain at the post “until the term ends,” while 9 percent wanted a replacement before the term expires. Only 26 percent “wanted him to continue to serve as president beyond the term.” The survey was conducted by contacting both landline telephone numbers and mobile phone numbers selected at random by computer. It received 628 valid responses, or 55 percent, of the 1,142 landline numbers of households with at least one eligible voter. There were 816 valid responses, or 42 percent, from 1,963 mobile phone numbers of eligible voters. The valid responses totaled 1,444.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14398503

0,Zero risk? Virus cases test Olympic organizers’ assurances,['THE ASSOCIATED PRESS'],"July 19, 2021 at 07:40 JST"," Two South African soccer players became the first athletes inside the Olympic Village to test positive for COVID-19, and other cases connected to the Tokyo Games were also confirmed Sunday, highlighting the herculean task organizers face to keep the virus contained while the world's biggest sports event plays out. The positive tests came as some of the 11,000 athletes and thousands more team officials expected from across the globe began arriving, having traveled through a pandemic to get to Tokyo. They'll all now live in close quarters in the Olympic Village on Tokyo Bay over the next three weeks. International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach said last week there was “zero” risk of athletes passing on the virus to Japanese or other residents of the village. But that bold statement was already being tested. The Olympics, which were postponed for a year because of the pandemic, are set to officially open on Friday and run until Aug. 8. The two soccer players and a team video analyst who also tested positive had been moved to “the Tokyo 2020 isolation facility,"" the South African Olympic committee said. The rest of the squad members and officials had also been quarantined. Those positive tests further stoked local fears, with the South African team scheduled to play against host nation Japan in its first game on Thursday. There has already been consistent opposition from the Japanese public to holding the Olympics during the pandemic, with fears that it could become a super-spreader event and cause a spike in infections among Japanese people. Bach and the IOC have insisted it will be safe and have forged ahead against most medical advice. The IOC says it sees the Games as a chance to foster international solidarity during difficult times, but the IOC would also lose billions of dollars in broadcast rights if the Games were to be canceled completely. Also Sunday, Team South Africa confirmed the coach of its rugby sevens team also tested positive at a pre-Olympics training camp in the southern Japanese city of Kagoshima. He was also in isolation there and would miss the entire rugby competition, the team said. And there were other Olympics-related positive tests. Olympic organizers said that another athlete had tested positive, although they were not residing in the Olympic Village. The athlete was not named and only identified as “non-Japanese."" The first International Olympic Committee official was reported as positive. He recorded a positive test on Saturday when arriving at a Tokyo airport. The IOC confirmed the test and identified him as IOC member Ryu Seung-min of South Korea. He was reportedly being held in isolation, too. Former distance runner and world championship bronze medalist Tegla Loroupe, the chief of mission of the IOC’s Refugee Olympic Team, tested positive for COVID-19 before the team was to depart its Doha, Qatar, training base for Tokyo, two people with knowledge of her condition told the AP. The team delayed its arrival in Tokyo while Loroupe is expected to stay behind, according to the two people, who requested anonymity because they weren’t authorized to reveal medical information. Organizers say that 55 people linked to the Olympics in Japan have reported positive tests since July 1, but that figure does not include athletes or others who may have arrived for training camps but are not yet under the “jurisdiction” of the organizing committee. Tokyo reported 1,008 new COVID-19 cases on Sunday, the 29th straight day that cases were higher than seven days previously. It was also the fifth straight day with more than 1,000 cases. The Olympics will open under a state of emergency in Tokyo and three neighboring prefectures. No fans, Japanese or foreign, will be allowed at any of the Olympic sports in Tokyo and the three neighboring prefectures. A few outlying venues may allow a small number of local fans, but it has effectively become a TV-only event. About 200 protesters gathered Sunday outside Shinjuku station in central Tokyo, waving signs that read “No Olympics.” It was the latest in a series of small protests against the Games in the last few months. “This is ignoring human rights and our right to life,” protester Karoi Todo told the AP. ""Infections are increasing. To do the Olympics is unforgivable.” Japanese and IOC organizers hope stringent testing protocols, where athletes, team officials and others are tested daily, will mitigate the risks posed by the thousands of foreigners arriving at once. Visiting athletes, officials and media will be in a ""soft quarantine"" situation and restricted to the Olympic venues, the village and designated hotels, and will be kept away from the Japanese general public. The IOC also says more than 80 percent of the athletes set to compete in Tokyo will be vaccinated against COVID-19. But, despite the assurances, the positive tests five days out from the opening ceremony showed the regulations aren't--and can't be--foolproof. The South African team's chief medical officer said every member of the team had two negative tests before traveling to Japan “as per Tokyo 2020 requirements.” They also tested negative on arrival in Tokyo, Dr. Phatho Zondi said. ""Team (South Africa) officials and management have followed all relevant Olympic Playbook rules, protocols and procedures throughout the pre-Games and Games arrival routines,"" the South African Olympic committee said. Coach Neil Powell and the entire South Africa rugby squad were held at a quarantine facility after arriving in Japan because of a positive COVID test on their flight, Team South Africa said. They were cleared to leave, only for Powell to test positive a few days later. Powell had been vaccinated against COVID-19 with the one-shot Johnson & Johnson vaccine in South Africa on May 24, team spokesman JJ Harmse told the AP. South African Olympic and soccer officials didn’t immediately confirm whether the two soccer players and official who tested positive had been vaccinated, although South Africa’s Olympic committee said in May it would offer all its Olympic athletes the J&J vaccine. The Olympics were effectively over before they began for the two soccer players and Powell as they would have to remain in quarantine for 14 days under Japanese regulations.

0,Japan’s Olympic security balancing act leaves few satisfied,['THE ASSOCIATED PRESS'],"July 17, 2021 at 18:17 JST"," Struggling businesses forced to temporarily shut down around Olympics venues. Olympic visitors ordered to install invasive apps and allow GPS tracking. Minders staking out hotels to keep participants from coming into contact with ordinary Japanese or visiting restaurants to sample the sushi. Japan's massive security apparatus has raised complaints that the nation, during the weeks of the Games, will look more like authoritarian North Korea or China than one of the world’s most powerful, vibrant democracies. The worry for many here, however, isn’t too much Big Brother. It’s that all the increased precautions won’t be nearly enough to stop the estimated 85,000 athletes, officials, journalists and other workers coming into Japan from introducing fast-spreading coronavirus variants to a largely unvaccinated population already struggling with mounting cases. “It’s all based on the honor system, and it’s causing concern that media people and other participants may go out of their hotels to eat in Ginza,” Takeshi Saiki, an opposition lawmaker, said of what he called Japan’s lax border controls. So far, the majority of Olympic athletes and other participants have been exempted from typical quarantine requirements. There have been regular breakdowns in security as the sheer enormity of trying to police so many visitors becomes clearer — and the opening ceremony looms. The Japanese press is filled with reports of Olympic-related people testing positive for the coronavirus. Photos and social media posts show foreigners linked to the Games breaking mask rules and drinking in public, smoking in airports — even, if the bios are accurate, posting on dating apps. “There are big holes in the bubbles,” said Ayaka Shiomura, another opposition lawmaker, speaking of the so-called “bubbles” that are supposed to separate the Olympics' participants from the rest of the country. The pandemic has tested democracies around the world as they try to strike a balance between the need to protect basic rights and the national imperative to control a disease that thrives when people gather in large numbers. Few places, however, have faced higher stakes than Tokyo will during July and August — or closer global scrutiny. The government, well aware of repeated domestic surveys that show strong opposition to the Games, argues that its security and monitoring measures are crucial as it tries to pull off an Olympics during a once-in-a-century pandemic. But as the restrictions are tested by increasing numbers of visitors, officials have been blamed for doing too much, and too little. The government and the Games’ organizers “are treating visitors as if they are potential criminals,” Chizuko Ueno, a professor emeritus of sociology at the University of Tokyo, said on YouTube. There's also lingering resentment over a widespread sentiment that Japan is facing this balancing act because the International Olympic Committee needs to have the Games happen, regardless of the state of the virus, to get the billions of dollars in media revenue critical to its survival. “The Olympics are held as an IOC business. Not only the Japanese people, but others around the world, were turned off by the Olympics after all of us saw the true nature of the Olympics and the IOC through the pandemic,” mountaineer Ken Noguchi told the online edition of the Nikkan Gendai newspaper. Senior sports editors at major international media companies, meanwhile, have asked organizers to “reconsider some measures that go beyond what is necessary to keep participants and residents safe,” saying they “show a disregard for the personal privacy and technological security of our colleagues.” Japan has fared better during the pandemic than many nations, but the Olympians will be arriving only a few months after a coronavirus spike had some Japanese hospitals nearing collapse as ICUs filled with the sick. While the surge has tempered, cases are rising enough for the declaration of yet another state of emergency in Tokyo. One of the highest-profile security problems came last month when a Ugandan team member arriving in Japan tested positive for what turned out to be the more contagious delta variant. He was quarantined at the airport, but the rest of the nine-person team was allowed to travel more than 500 kilometers (300 miles) on a chartered bus to their pre-Olympics camp, where a second Ugandan tested positive, forcing the team and seven city officials and drivers who had close contact with them to self-isolate. On Friday, a Uganda team member went missing, raising more questions about the oversight of Olympic participants. So what are the restrictions that Olympic-linked visitors face? For the first 14 days in Japan, Olympic visitors outside the athletes' village are banned from using public transportation and from going to bars, tourist spots and most restaurants. They cannot even take a walk, or visit anywhere, in fact, that’s not specifically mentioned in activity plans submitted in advance. There are some exceptions authorized by organizers: specifically designated convenience stores, takeaway places and, in rare cases, some restaurants that have private rooms. Athletes, tested daily for the coronavirus, will be isolated in the athletes’ village and are expected to stay there, or in similarly locked-down bubbles at venues or training sites. Those who break the rules could be sent home or receive fines and lose the right to participate in the Games. Everyone associated with the Olympics will be asked to install two apps when entering Japan. One is an immigration and health reporting app, and the other is a contact tracing app that uses Bluetooth. They will also have to consent to allowing organizers to use GPS to monitor their movements and contacts through their smartphones if there’s an infection or violation of rules. “We are not going to monitor the behavior at all times,” Organizing Committee CEO Toshiro Muto said. “The thing is, though, if there should be issues pertaining to their activity then, since the GPS function will be on, we’ll be able to verify their activities.” Japan also plans to station human monitors at venues and hotels, though it’s not yet clear how many. “We will control every entry and exit. We will have a system that will not allow anyone to go outside freely,” Olympic Minister Tamayo Marukawa said. Other nations, both democratic and autocratic, have also tried to control and monitor behavior and businesses during the pandemic. In the United States, for instance, NFL teams tracked their athletes in the team facilities. South Korean health authorities have aggressively used smartphone GPS data, credit-card transaction records and surveillance videos to find and isolate potential virus carriers. Tracking apps are used to monitor thousands of individuals quarantined at home. In China, mask mandates, lockdowns confining millions to their homes and case tracing on a nationwide scale have faced little or no opposition. North Korea has shut its borders even tighter, skipped the Olympics and canceled or seriously curtailed access for foreign diplomats, aid workers and outside journalists. While the security restrictions in Japan will be a hassle for visitors, they could also hit locals hard. Hiroshi Kato, a fencing instructor, said he worries that he’ll lose even more business than he did during the pandemic because he’s been ordered to move from the building where he works across from the main Olympics stadium from July 1 to Sep. 19, for unspecified security reasons. “I feel helpless,” he said in an interview. “To safely hold the Games, some restrictions are understandable … but (the organizers) knew this for a long time and perhaps could have provided some assistance for us.”",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14397538

The organizing committee also said that 14 individuals with Olympic accreditation tested positive for COVID-19 on July 17. They were connected in some way with the Olympics, either working for the organizing committee, mass media or suppliers at venues in Tokyo, Hokkaido, Chiba and Saitama.

0,Athletes in close contact with infected person can still compete,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"July 17, 2021 at 16:56 JST"," Olympic athletes in close contact with an individual confirmed to have COVID-19 will be allowed to compete if they test negative in a PCR check held just prior to their event under a special exemption granted for the Games. Tamayo Marukawa, the state minister in charge of the Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics, announced the exemption at a July 16 news conference. It flies in the face of measures applied to Japanese residents who are required to self-isolate at home for 14 days if they had close contact with a COVID-19 patient. “Preventing a spread of infections by implementing strict infection-prevention measures is our priority, but we also want to make it possible for athletes to participate in the events,” Marukawa said at a news conference. This latest step was conveyed through the Tokyo Olympic organizing committee to the international bodies governing each sport, according to officials of the Cabinet Secretariat. If the government enforced its self-quarantine policy for athletes who come into close contact with COVID-19 patients, it would likely mean they would be unable to compete in their chosen event. Any athlete confirmed to have been in close contact with a patient will be asked to remain in a single room for 14 days and prohibited from leaving except to train or compete, according to Marukawa and organizing committee sources. They will also have to take meals and travel to the training or competition venue by themselves, and undergo PCR tests daily. If they test negative for a PCR test given within six hours of the start of competition, the athlete will be allowed to compete. In sports such as judo where athletes are in close contact during competition, PCR tests will be administered after the match as well. A list of athletes thought to be at risk of having come into close contact will be drawn up beforehand to prepare for the event where an athlete tests positive.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14397404
0,‘5th wave’ of COVID-19 cases feared in Tokyo and Osaka,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"July 17, 2021 at 15:34 JST"," With just days to go before the Tokyo Olympics kick off, signs are emerging of a “fifth wave” in COVID-19 cases in major urban areas, particularly the capital and Osaka in western Japan. Tokyo on July 16 reported more than 1,000 fresh cases of novel coronavirus infection for the third straight day. Metropolitan government officials noted that a record 303 were confirmed with the more feared Delta variant. While Tokyo will remain under a state of emergency until Aug. 22, spreading infections in the three neighboring prefectures of Chiba, Kanagawa and Saitama led prefectural authorities on July 16 to decide to expand the geographical range of pre-emergency measures in their jurisdictions. The Kanagawa prefectural government on July 16 confirmed 446 new cases. The number of cases per 100,000 residents over the most recent week came to 26.1, which exceeded the standard of 25 to demarcate whether a prefecture is in the most serious stage 4 of infections spreading. Pre-emergency measures had been in place for four Kanagawa cities, Yokohama, Kawasaki, Sagamihara and Atsugi, but those steps will be expanded, effective July 22, to cover all municipalities, with the exception of Kiyokawa village which has a population of about 3,000. The Kanagawa prefectural government also issued its own “state of emergency” and is asking all establishments to no longer serve alcoholic beverages and close their doors at 8 p.m. “Infections are surging at a pace similar to the beginning of the year when we were under a state of emergency,” Kanagawa Governor Yuji Kuroiwa said at a July 16 news conference. “We expect hospital beds for COVID-19 patients to face a very tight situation by the end of July.” In Chiba Prefecture, new cases rose 1.3-fold over the previous week. Chiba Governor Toshihito Kumagai said asking the central government to declare a state of emergency was “a realistic option” if the infection increase rate remained unchanged. On July 16, the Chiba prefectural government decided to add the cities of Yachiyo and Kamagaya on July 19 to nine municipalities already covered by pre-emergency measures. Bars and restaurants in those municipalities can only serve alcohol until 7 p.m. and only to parties of one or two individuals who stay for less than 90 minutes. The Saitama prefectural government is also vastly expanding the number of municipalities covered by pre-existing measures from just Saitama and Kawaguchi. It said 18 municipalities, such as Kawagoe and Tokorozawa, will be added, effective July 20. “There is a clear increasing trend and new infections are spreading in those areas bordering Tokyo,” Saitama Governor Motohiro Ono said, pointing to new cases topping 300 on July 15 for the first time in about six months. Bars and restaurants in the affected areas will be asked to only serve alcohol to solitary customers or family groups. Osaka Prefecture on July 16 recorded its fourth straight day of more than 200 fresh COVID-19 cases, while neighboring Hyogo recorded the fourth straight day of more than 70 new cases. An advisory panel to the health ministry said an increase in pedestrian traffic was a key factor behind the rise in new cases. Studies showed July 14 that while nighttime pedestrian traffic gradually fell in Tokyo, there were increases in both daytime and nighttime pedestrian traffic in the three neighboring prefectures. Health experts raised concerns that infections could spread from the greater Tokyo metropolitan area to all parts of Japan. Nighttime pedestrian traffic in Osaka has also been on the rise since the state of emergency was lifted on July 11. The advisory board said it was clear that infections were also on the rise again in the Kansai region.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14397380

0,Government medical adviser urges more virus limits,['COMPILED FROM WIRE REPORTS'],"July 17, 2021 at 09:25 JST"," Japan’s top medical adviser for Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga’s government urged authorities to step up virus measures ahead of the Olympics and asked the people to avoid trips. Tokyo registered 1,271 new cases Friday, the day after recording a six-month high of 1,308. Dr. Shigeru Omi, who heads a government COVID-19 taskforce, says the next two months will be the “most crucial stage” in Japan’s fight against the pandemic. He urged people to watch the Olympics on TV at home with family members or close friends in small groups. Omi says the ongoing upsurge in the Tokyo region is likely to accelerate, with the summer vacation, the Olympics and the Buddhist holiday week in August when people are likely to travel. Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga last week declared a fourth state of emergency in Tokyo, which started Monday and lasts until Aug. 22. Nationwide, Japan has reported 830,000 cases and 15,000 confirmed deaths. International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach had suggested to Suga that if the virus situation improved spectators could be let into stadiums, media said. Omi said that it was unlikely that the number of daily coronavirus infection cases would fall in a short span of time to levels that justify holding the Games with spectators.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14397251
0,Tokyo hospitals bracing for the worst in virus infections,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"July 16, 2021 at 19:25 JST"," The latest surge in COVID-19 cases in Tokyo has medical experts so worried that some are suggesting canceling the Summer Olympics--even after the start of competitions--if the infection spread worsens. “The medical situation has already been at the highest alert level in Tokyo, and more infections will only put more pressure on the health care system,” Masataka Inokuchi, vice chairman of the Tokyo Medical Association, said at the Tokyo metropolitan government’s meeting on July 15 on measures to curb COVID-19 cases. “Please do not allow new infection cases to rise higher than they are now.” Tokyo’s medical facilities are starting to feel the strain. The number of hospitalized COVID-19 patients in Tokyo jumped to more than 2,000 in three weeks from around 1,200 in late June. The number of cases in which public health centers could not find available hospital beds for infected patients and asked the Tokyo metropolitan government to take over such cases tripled to 125 from 40 a month ago. The Tokyo metropolitan government did learn a lesson from the third wave of infections that started at the end of last year and pushed the medical capacity for COVID-19 patients to the limit. The government increased the number of beds for COVID-19 patients by more than 2,000 from early January, mainly at Tokyo-run or public corporation hospitals. Tokyo officials said they had secured 6,314 beds as of July 8, and more than 90 percent of them, or 5,882, are believed ready for COVID-19 patients. The hospital bed occupancy rate was 31.8 percent as of July 14. The Asahi Shimbun But a source familiar with the hospital-bed operation said that increasing the number of beds to resolve the growing virus problem is “a pie in the sky.” “More hospitals that can accept COVID-19 patients already don’t have enough beds to accept new patients,” the source said. A Tokyo official mentioned another problem that has been persistent during the pandemic: “If the number of patients soars, there won’t be enough medical staff in some cases who can provide care for the hospitalized patients.” Nihon University Itabashi Hospital in the capital’s Itabashi Ward has 56 beds prepared for COVID-19 patients with moderate and serious symptoms. Twenty-three of those beds were filled as of July 14. The number of COVID-19 patients at the hospital had hovered around 10 until June, but the figure doubled in just one week. According to the hospital, many of the infected patients during the third wave were in their 70s or older. But the hospital is now seeing more patients in their 40s or 50s. In a worrying trend, 40 percent of the patients over the past two weeks were infected with the more contagious Delta variant. “If new cases increase at this pace and the number reaches 2,000 per day, all our beds will quickly be filled,” Satoru Takahashi, chief of the hospital, said. He also said the hospital would be forced to assign additional general ward nurses to COVID-19 sections if the number of patients exceeds 30. Another hospital doctor who treats COVID-19 patients with serious symptoms said the availability of hospital beds is no solution if there is no one to take care of the patients. “Even if we have empty beds, we cannot accept patients unless we have enough medical workers,” the doctor said. “The speed of infections must be slowed down to prevent a ‘clogging’ in hospitalizations.” The latest state of emergency was declared for the capital on July 12. But crowds have been seen in entertainment districts, and pedestrian traffic and travel will likely increase in the summer holidays. In addition, thousands of Olympic-related visitors from overseas are now streaming into the country ahead of the July 23 Opening Ceremony for the Tokyo Games. Shigeru Omi, head of the central government’s panel on responding to the COVID-19 pandemic, mentioned his concerns at an out-of-session meeting of the Upper House Cabinet Committee on July 15. “People have gotten used to the state of emergency, so measures to restrict people’s actions and movements have become less and less effective,” he said. Omi urged the government to invest more time and effort into science technologies, such as vaccines and testing. ‘CONSIDER CANCELING OLYMPICS’ Nobuhiko Okabe, head of the Kawasaki City Institute for Public Health who chairs the Tokyo Olympic organizing committee’s expert panel on anti-virus measures, said drastic steps may be needed to protect the medical system and keep the public safe from the virus. “Like the serious situation in Osaka Prefecture during the fourth wave, if Tokyo falls into a state where people who need hospital treatment can’t be admitted to hospitals, we should consider canceling the Olympics,” he said in an interview with The Asahi Shimbun on July 13. “We have no time for the Olympics” if people cannot receive the necessary medical care, he said. Okabe added that he might ask the central government and the organizing committee to cancel the Olympics even after start of competitions.

The panel advising the Tokyo metropolitan government also raised concerns about a crisis in the medical care system now that the number of hospitalized patients exceeded 2,000. Meanwhile, metropolitan government officials reported 1,308 fresh COVID-19 cases in the capital on July 15. The last time the daily tally exceeded 1,300 was Jan. 21. At the July 15 panel meeting, a report was submitted about the daily average of new COVID-19 cases over the course of a week. The figure for July 14 was 817, a sharp increase from the 625 of the previous week. The rate of increase was 31 percent, contrasting with the 24-percent increase of the previous week. The experts forecast that if that rate of increase remained unchanged, the average would reach 1,402 by July 28 and 2,406 by Aug. 11. The latter figure would exceed the 1,816 average at the peak of the third wave of infections in winter. A main cause of the recent surge in new cases is believed to be the Delta variant of the novel coronavirus. As of July 14, a total of 1,297 patients were found with that variant. The daily figure for July 13 was 178, a record high. The experts also reported that while the Delta variant made up 14.7 percent of all cases for the one-week period ending June 27, the figure had increased to 21.5 percent by the week ending July 4. One expert said the pace at which the Delta variant was becoming the main one had accelerated. One positive note reported at the panel meeting concerned pedestrian traffic, which was reported to have decreased in Tokyo following the start of the fourth state of emergency from July 12. According to a study by the Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Medical Science, over a three-day period from July 12, the nighttime pedestrian traffic had decreased by 6.3 percent while the daytime pedestrian traffic declined by 2.3 percent. “A certain level of cooperation has been obtained due to the state of emergency,” said Atsushi Nishida, who heads the Research Center for Social Science and Medicine at the institute, at the July 15 meeting. But he added to further restrain new infections there was a need to further limit the number of those thinking about visiting Tokyo for leisure purposes. The reports about an increase in new cases raised concerns about the availability of hospital beds to treat COVID-19 patients. One report was that the number of hospitalized patients rose sharply from the 1,200 or so level of late June to more than 2,000 in three weeks’ time. The number of cases reported by public health offices about not being able to find an open hospital bed for a patient had risen from about 40 or so a day about a month ago to 125 as of July 14. “If this situation should continue, there will be an increase in young and middle-aged patients with midlevel symptoms, and there is a possibility that could be followed by an increase in those with serious symptoms,"" said Masataka Inokuchi, vice chair of the Tokyo Medical Association, at the July 15 meeting.

Under the new plan, the central government will cut the shipment of some 350,000 doses of the Pfizer vaccine to such municipalities as Sapporo, Sendai, Nagoya, Osaka and Kita-Kyushu cities as well as Tokyo’s Setagaya, Ota and Adachi wards, according to the health ministry. The central government previously said that it would ship about 11.7 million doses of the Pfizer vaccine every two weeks in August and September and distribute 80 percent of the doses, or around 9.36 million, as a “base supply” to prefectural governments in proportion to their populations. The central government had also indicated that Pfizer shipments would be cut by 10 percent for local governments that have more than six weeks’ worth of excess stock as shown by its vaccination record system (VRS). The 350,000 Pfizer doses that the central government will stop supplying to local governments with an excess stock will be added to 1.755 million doses categorized as “adjustment supplies” for prefectural governments. Each prefectural government will allocate the adjustment supplies to municipalities. The central government said it is currently preparing to enable prefectural governments to access the VRS to facilitate a smooth distribution and to share the number of shots administered and other data starting on July 15. The VRS, however, has proved ineffective in revealing the stock of vaccine doses in real time, due to delays at the municipal level in entering vaccination data into the system in some cases. Kono has called on municipalities to quickly enter the data on the VRS. But the central government will likely face a backlash from those targeted for a reduction in vaccine supply under the new distribution plan.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14394856

The team of 14 athletes and seven staff members arrived at Narita International Airport in Chiba Prefecture on the evening of July 13. Results of their COVID-19 tests at the airport’s quarantine station came back negative. But at least one passenger who boarded the same flight tested positive. The Tokyo Olympic and Paralympic promotion headquarters, set up under the Cabinet Secretariat, deemed that all 14 players and four of the seven staffers were possibly in close contact with the virus carrier, based on their seat numbers. The team, known as the Blitzboks or Springbok Sevens, was scheduled to travel to Kagoshima in southern Kagoshima Prefecture for a pre-Olympic training camp on July 14. But the trip was postponed, and the members were transported to temporary accommodations, city officials and others said on July 14.

0,Tokyo’s state of emergency lacks options to stop rising infections,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"July 13, 2021 at 19:21 JST"," After declaring a fourth state of emergency for Tokyo on July 12 amid a resurgence of COVID-19 cases in the capital, the government is finding it has few options left to stop infections other than vaccines. The government was compelled to take the initiative in issuing the emergency, lasting until Aug. 22, because delaying judgment even for one or two weeks over imposing it was believed likely to result in soaring infections. “Vaccination is the decisive card of anti-virus measures, as we have always said,” Chief Cabinet Secretary Katsunobu Kato said at a news conference on July 12. Kato said that the fourth state of emergency was issued to prevent infections from rising at an explosive speed across Japan until the vaccination efforts show effectiveness. According to the government’s tally, 29.6 percent of people had received at least one inoculation across the nation by July 12. Shigeru Omi, the chairman of the government panel of experts dealing with the pandemic, said at a July 8 news conference, assuming that more middle-aged or older people, who are more likely to develop serious symptoms, will get jabs, “ People will be more relieved than now around September, as medical capacity will less strained. ” But there is still an issue of how the ongoing resurgence will be contained. “We have the vaccine, but the many causes of why cases rise remain,” Omi said. COVID-19 cases are likely to spread in the summer, too, experts say. That’s because after the rainy season more people stay inside while running air conditioners with little ventilation. The second wave of infections started in Tokyo in last year in July. Hokkaido, where people often keep windows open when indoors, had no second wave at the time. But in autumn, the number of patients soared there, too. Cases of the most contagious Delta variant are currently increasing in the capital. Delta variant cases accounted for 14.7 percent among tested samples for the week through June 27, according to the Tokyo metropolitan government. The following week, the figure was 18.7 percent in the preliminary report. Delta variant cases are expected to account for more than 90 percent in Japan around the middle of August, according to the prediction by Hiroshi Nishiura, a professor at Kyoto University. If that happens, the Delta variant will become 1.9 times more contagious than the conventional virus and 1.3 times more contagious than the Alpha variant, which caused the fourth wave in the spring. “During the fourth wave, the state of emergency was issued earlier for Tokyo, which prevented a bigger wave like the one the Kansai region has experienced,” said Kazuhiro Tateda, professor of infectious diseases at Toho University, and a member of the government’s panel on the pandemic. “The fourth state of emergency is strongly intended to once again prevent a bigger wave,” he reiterated. “In the autumn, when most middle-aged or older people are fully vaccinated, the situation might be different. If we can contain the soaring infections fully, the fourth state of emergency could be the last one. We’ve got to make that happen.” But the government has few new measures for decreasing the number of infections. During the summer, the government is starting a new measure to test people who travel from airports in Tokyo and Osaka Prefecture to Hokkaido and Okinawa Prefecture if they give their consent. But its main measures to date have always been focused on eating and drinking establishments. The government is asking restaurants and bars that provide alcoholic beverages or karaoke service to suspend their business operations all day in the prefectures covered under the emergency. If establishments do not offer alcoholic beverages, they are being asked to close by 8 p.m. The government is also beefing up anti-virus measures, such as expanding testing capacity with simplified testing kits and ventilating indoor spaces as much as possible with devices that measure CO2 levels. But Mitsuru Fukuda, a professor of crisis management at Nihon University, pointed out that the public may be less than receptive to complying with policies to fight the virus. “People have been putting up with living under anti-virus policies for a year and a half, ” Fukuda said. “Their stress and dissatisfaction are accumulating and are going to exceed the threshold. Once they cross that, people will be beyond the point of no return.” Though the government said that the vaccine will be the decisive factor in fighting COVID-19 and pledged to swiftly get shots into arms, its insufficient supply and slow vaccine rollout is causing the public to lose faith. “People are disappointed at ad hoc policies and tend to give up their hopes for the government,” Fukuda said. “The key point is whether people are motivated to keep up the effort to follow the measures. “As for crisis management, if the strategy turns out to be wrong, you can change it. But you have to explain such a change every time. The government needs to persuade people to form a consensus. Other than the vaccination efforts, it should show the specific policies and measures and its road map, such as how many beds will be increased or reinforcing the quarantine. ” (This article was written by Akiyoshi Abe and Tokiko Tsuji, a senior staff writer.)",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14394086
0,Japan to soon accept requests for ‘vaccine passports’,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"July 13, 2021 at 18:47 JST"," Local governments will start accepting applications from July 26 for COVID-19 “vaccine passports” that certify holders have been inoculated against the virus if they are planning to travel overseas. Chief Cabinet Secretary Katsunobu Kato announced the development at a July 12 news conference. The move comes on the heels of calls, particularly from the business community, for vaccine passports as the United States and Europe are taking steps to require proof of inoculation against the novel coronavirus from arriving travelers. Kato said proof of vaccination will be issued only for people who expect to visit countries and territories where quarantine procedures will be eased if evidence of vaccination is presented. The documentation will come in written form stating when the individual received his or her vaccine shot, the type of vaccine administered and where, among other information. It will be provided at no charge for the time being. Those seeking proof will be required to submit an application and their regular passport to their local governments where their residence certificate is registered at the time they receive their jab. Kato said the government is not contemplating using vaccination proof for activities inside Japan. “It would be inappropriate if the availability of vaccine passports led to enforcing vaccinations or to discrimination against unvaccinated people,” he said. However, he indicated that the government may consider giving preferential treatment to those who opt to get vaccinated.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14394076

Only the day before, Yasutoshi Nishimura, the state minister in charge of economic revitalization who also heads the central government effort against the pandemic, drew howls of protest, not only from opposition lawmakers but even within the ruling coalition fearing a backlash from owners of bars and restaurants already reeling from the economic impact of the pandemic. Nishimura suggested that financial institutions would be asked to lobby customers that operate bars and restaurants to comply with government requests to temporarily close. He also did not deny the possibility of withholding loans to holdouts. His comment came after the central government decided July 8 to declare a fourth state of emergency for the capital between July 12 and Aug. 22, during which the Tokyo Olympics will have been held. Businesses in the capital that serve alcohol or provide karaoke services will be asked to close during that period. Not only did Kato say the central government was retracting Nishimura’s proposal, but added he had instructed Nishimura to be more careful about what he says during news conferences in the future. Prior to his news conference, Kato met with Hiroshi Moriyama, the chairman of the Diet Affairs Committee of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party. Moriyama asked Kato that care be taken so that the public did not get the wrong impression of what the government was intending to do.

Nishimura, appearing July 9 on a TV news program to answer criticism that his proposal was intended to abuse the hold financial institutions have over their customers, said, “Government agencies will not ask financial institutions to work” toward compliance with government requests on the part of bars and restaurants.

Though the agency initially planned not to disclose the vaccination status of imperial family members for privacy reasons, it made an exception for the emperor, an agency official said. “We deemed it appropriate to make an announcement about the emperor as he is the symbol of the state,” the official said, adding the agency released the information after having gained his consent. The emperor, who turned 61 in February, was inoculated at his Akasaka Imperial Residence on the afternoon of July 6. It is not clear whether Empress Masako, 57, was also vaccinated. The inoculation of the emperor was arranged as progress has been made in mass vaccination programs pushed by local governments around the country and businesses, according to the official. Naruhito has assumed the role of the honorary patron of the Tokyo 2020 Olympic and Paralympic Games. Whether he will attend the July 23 Opening Ceremony to declare the start of the Games is still being discussed, according to the agency. Six elderly imperial family members, including Naruhito’s parents, Emperor Emeritus Akihito, 87, and Empress Emerita Michiko 86, received their first vaccinations on June 1.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14389484
0,Japan gets only 34% of Moderna vaccine doses initially ordered,['By JUNYA SAKAMOTO/ Staff Writer'],"July 7, 2021 at 17:12 JST"," Taro Kono, who heads Japan’s COVID-19 vaccination program, revealed on July 6 that 13.7 million doses of Moderna Inc.’s vaccine had arrived by the end of June, only about one-third of the total originally ordered. Kono, who is also the administrative reform minister, said at a news conference that changes in the contract with the U.S. pharmaceutical company led to the lower amount received. Under the contract signed with the health ministry last year, Moderna promised to supply 40 million doses to Japan by the end of June. But Kono said the amount was decreased by more than 60 percent after further discussions between the government and Moderna. “Moderna vaccines are in high demand worldwide, and we, as the Japanese government, decided to secure the amount that we truly need after consultations with Moderna,” Kono said. Asked if Moderna told Japan that it would be difficult to supply 40 million doses by the deadline, Kono declined to give further details, saying, “The high demand for Moderna vaccines was an underlying reason.” He was also unspecific about when the contract was changed. “It was quite in the early days when we changed the 40-million-dose number,” he said. “I don’t remember exactly when. But for all I know, it was possibly before the Golden Week holidays (from late April).” Citing the contract, the Japanese government had declined to announce the actual amount of Moderna vaccines being supplied to the country. The company is expected to provide 50 million doses to Japan by the end of September. Its vaccine is being used mainly for inoculation programs at large companies and universities. In early June, the central government started accepting applications for Moderna shots in these programs. But demand was so overwhelming that the central government stopped accepting new applications and will not resume the process. Asked by a reporter if the government’s decision to decrease the Moderna supply has added to the confusion over the vaccine rollout, Kono said, “Not at all.”",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14389467
0,Kono: Pfizer vaccine supply to keep shrinking until September,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"July 7, 2021 at 16:40 JST"," The supply of Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccines will continue dwindling across Japan until at least September, according to a central government announcement that has done little to ease the frustration and anger among municipal governments. Many local governments have already stopped accepting reservations for the shots or even canceled bookings because of the central government’s failure to efficiently supply the doses. “We were told (by the central government) to pick up the pace to vaccinate people,” an Aomori prefectural government official said. “But now it feels like the ladder was removed before we could climb.” The inoculation process at the local level could become even more clogged under the new supply schedule for August and September, revealed by Taro Kono, the administrative reform minister who is in charge of the COVID-19 vaccine rollout, on July 6. Kono said at a news conference that the central government will ship about 11.7 million doses of the Pfizer vaccine every two weeks in August and September, down from the level of up to 18.7 million doses every two weeks in June. The government has already reduced the supply quantity for July. Around 9.36 million Pfizer doses, or 80 percent of the 11.7 million doses, will be categorized as a “base supply” and distributed to prefectural governments in proportion to their populations, Kono said. Additionally, 1.755 million doses, or 15 percent, will be categorized as “adjustment supplies” for prefectural governments. Each prefectural government will allocate the adjustment supplies to municipalities. Kono noted that some municipalities have many clinics and carry an excess stock of Pfizer vaccines, but others do not. He said prefectural government officials should make adjustments in distribution at their own discretion. “We will move (the vaccines) from prefectures that have excess stock to those that do not under a long-term vision,” Kono said. The remaining 5 percent of the two-month supply, or 585,000 doses, will be used at mass vaccination centers run by local governments. Kono also said Pfizer shipments will be cut by 10 percent for local governments that have more than six weeks’ worth of excess stock as shown by the central government’s vaccination record system (VRS). However, that VRS has proved ineffective in revealing real-time progress in inoculating the population. Delays at the municipal level in entering vaccination data into the system have led to mess-ups in supply distribution because of outdated information. Health minister Norihisa Tamura on July 6 said at a news conference that about 90 million doses of the Pfizer vaccine had been shipped to local governments by the end of June. But according to the VRS, the number of shots given is 50 million. “That means approximately 40 million doses are in circulation,” Tamura said. “There are mismatches going on.” The central government hopes the announcement of the two-month supply calendar will help dispel growing concerns among local governments, many of which will start large-scale vaccination campaigns targeting people under 65 this summer. However, for many municipalities, the new supply schedule is too little too late. The city government of Hirosaki in the northern prefecture of Aomori had intended to start accepting vaccine reservations for residents under 65 from July 7. But officials on July 6 halted the plan after learning that the central government would provide only 11,700 doses to the city in late July, despite Hirosaki’s request for 88,000 doses. “The central government’s ambiguous foresight has caused this situation,” Hirosaki Mayor Hiroshi Sakurada said. “I cannot contain my resentment.” The Aomori prefectural government is worried other municipalities will face the same fate because the central government’s late July shipment will be 88 boxes (1,170 doses per box), way below the prefecture’s order of 448 boxes. Similar concerns were raised in Miyagi Prefecture. The northeastern prefectural government learned that its supply of Pfizer vaccines from July 19 to Aug. 1 will only be about a quarter of its initial order. As a result, the prefectural capital of Sendai suspended taking new appointments on June 6. “Out vaccine project has been running smoothly up until now,” a city official said. “It is frustrating.” Many other municipalities have made those tough decisions. Major cities, such as Kobe and Osaka, stopped taking reservations for the Pfizer vaccine last week. Kobe officials have also canceled appointments already made by 50,000 people.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14389391

0,Report: Serbian tests positive arriving for Tokyo Olympics,['THE ASSOCIATED PRESS'],"July 4, 2021 at 18:05 JST"," A member of the Serbian Olympic rowing team has tested positive for COVID-19 while trying to enter Japan for the Tokyo Olympics that are to open in just under three weeks. The news was reported Sunday by the Japanese agency Kyodo and cited Japanese health ministry officials. Officials said the athlete was isolated at Tokyo’s Haneda airport. Four others traveling along were reportedly transferred to a facility near the airport. They had been scheduled to travel to a training camp in Nanto in central Japan. Nanto officials said the training camp was likely to be canceled. The report comes after two members of the Ugandan Olympic delegation tested positive for the coronavirus last month upon arrival in Japan. One tested positive at Narita airport near Tokyo, but the remainder of the team was allowed to travel to a training site. A second member of the delegation was found later to have the virus. Seiko Hashimoto, the president of the organizing committee, said on Friday that more than 500 participants had arrived in Tokyo without incident. About 11,000 Olympic and 4.400 Paralympic athletes will arrive for the Olympics, in addition to tens of thousands of other coaches, judges, and Olympic officials. Organizers still have not decided about allowing local fans into venues. Fans from abroad were banned months ago. Almost two weeks ago, organizers said they would allow indoor and outdoor venues to be filled to 50% of capacity up to 10,000. But with new infections rising daily in Tokyo for two weeks, local organizers are expected to meet this week with the International Olympic Committee and others and lower the cap, or remove spectators altogether. Japan media have reported many possible scenarios: They include: no fans at all; no fans at the opening ceremony on July 23; limits on fans at night events; dropping the limit at all venues to 5,000. Dr. Shigeru Omi, a top government medical adviser, has said repeatedly that no fans is the safest option. He has also questioned why the Olympics are being held at all in the middle of a pandemic. He has termed it “abnormal.”",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14387290

0,Municipalities forced to suspend vaccinations due to dire shortage,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"July 3, 2021 at 14:40 JST"," Already far behind many other countries, Japan's plans for a national rollout of COVID-19 vaccines--Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga's ace in the hole for pulling off the Tokyo Olympics this month--appear to be fast degenerating into yet another ill-conceived policy effort. Suga set a goal of 1 million jabs a day, along with an expansion of vaccination programs to ones handled by the Self-Defense Forces, workplaces and universities. Local government officials tried to comply with those moves, working hard to find locations and medical staff to carry out the task. The goal of 1 million shots was reached in June. It now turns out that the rush to vaccinate may be behind a shortage of vaccine supplies from later this month. Only about 30 percent of requests submitted by local governments for vaccines developed jointly by U.S. pharmaceutical company Pfizer Inc. and German biocommerce company BioNTech will likely be met in the two-week period from July 19, health ministry officials said. That led local governments to temporarily suspend accepting reservations for vaccinations due to uncertainties about how many vaccine doses will be available. The Osaka city government on July 2 decided to postpone the scheduled July 12 start of reservations for those 60 and older who have yet to receive a single jab. Chiba city next to Tokyo decided to stop taking reservations for senior citizens 65 and older trying to get their first jabs. The Yamagata city government on June 25 stopped taking reservations for shots at local doctors’ offices. Yamagata Mayor Takahiro Sato was clearly miffed with the central government over the confusion that has arisen. “In compliance with the government's policy, medical care professionals and city government officials did their level best to expand the vaccination program,” Sato said June 23 when the decision was made to suspend reservations. “But now limits have arisen on the supply of vaccines. There is incredible confusion among those handling the vaccinations.” In Osaka Prefecture, only about 80 percent of requests for vaccines from municipal authorities have been filled since June. The figure is expected to fall to 55 percent for the period between July 5 and 18. On July 2, Osaka Governor Hirofumi Yoshimura met with Taro Kono, the state minister coordinating the vaccination program at the central government level, and asked that prefectures that had been under a state of emergency due to the novel coronavirus pandemic be given priority for receiving vaccines. A similar request was made to Kono and Norihisa Tamura, the health minister, the previous day by the governors of Tokyo and its three neighboring prefectures. The Pfizer vaccine has been used to inoculate senior citizens aged 65 and older, the first group to receive jabs outside of medical care professionals. But the central government also announced plans to allow shots to be administered at workplaces and universities from June 21. The vaccine developed by Moderna Inc. of the United States is being used for the workplace vaccinations. Inundated with requests from companies and universities for vaccines, the Moderna supply of 50 million doses quickly ran out, leading the government to shift some of the Pfizer vaccines that would have been used by local governments at mass vaccination centers to the workplace program. Health ministry officials said they had received requests for about 100 million Pfizer doses from local governments for June and July. But only around 60 million doses are available for that period. Associates of Suga suggested that local governments may have to ask local residents in municipalities with a vaccine deficiency to wait longer than the normal three-week period before getting their second and final jab.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14386679

0,"Late-night drinking returns to Osaka, despite anti-virus rule",['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"July 2, 2021 at 18:11 JST"," OSAKA—Bar owners and customers here, fed up with the prefectural government asking for curtailed operating hours during the prolonged COVID-19 pandemic, are blatantly defying the latest request. Many drinking establishments in the city are now open and often crowded with customers well after 8 p.m., when they should have closed in line with the current pre-emergency measures in place in Osaka Prefecture. Some businesses in Osaka city’s Minami entertainment district have posted signs saying they would be closed until the pre-emergency measures are lifted. But one “izakaya” Japanese-style pub in the area was still open one recent night even at 10:30 p.m. And almost all of its 70 or so seats were filled. “I have to protect the livelihoods of my employees,” the izakaya’s manager in his 40s said. “I cannot tolerate (the government’s requests) any longer.” Most of the customers were young, and they were laughing and talking even though no plastic barriers were in place on the tables. The pub had shortened its business hours under the state of emergency that was lifted on June 20. Under the pre-emergency measures still in place, alcohol should not be served after 8 p.m. Although the izakaya manager knows about that requested deadline, his establishment remains open until midnight. On weekdays, he gets about 100 customers, while the number doubles on weekends. The manager said that in late 2020, he applied for money distributed to establishments that cooperate with the request to shorten their business hours. He finally received the funds in June. “I was in a very difficult situation having to wait six months,” the manager said. The pub has a staff of about 20. He acknowledged that many other businesses in the vicinity have continued to comply with the prefectural government request. “We all have our lives to live,” the manager said. “From now, I believe we have to take responsibility on our own in deciding how long to remain open.” A number of places around JR Tenma Station were also open well beyond 8 p.m. Some businesses with signs saying they would close at 8 p.m. were still operating close to midnight. A 22-year-old university student who was waiting in line with two friends to enter a bar also expressed frustration with the requested restrictions on serving alcohol. “We decided to go out drinking for the first time in a long time because the state of emergency was lifted,” the student said. “We searched for a place that was open until late because if we are to drink, we want to do so until after midnight. “Because we held off for such a long time, I think the sense of urgency among younger people has weakened.” Some businesses said they have found it difficult to comply with other government requests on measures to halt the virus. One such request is to allow entry to groups of two customers at the most. A fortysomething owner of an izakaya recalled the time three regulars showed up. “I couldn’t bring myself to refuse them,” he said. Two tables were set up about a meter apart so the trio would be separated but close enough to hold a conversation. The owner said he knows of businesses that no longer comply with the government requests. “Customers are flocking to those businesses that are open until late, and I feel that is increasing the risk of infection,” he said. Osaka Prefecture has dispatched about 800 workers to check for compliance with the requests, but that task has proved rather futile, given that there are about 58,000 bars and restaurants in the prefecture. They work in teams of two for the patrols. One team set a quota of checking 20 businesses a night. The pair only managed to check on 15. One prefectural government employee on patrol said bar owners have complained about not receiving the government money for cooperating with the requests. A colleague was lectured for about an hour by another business owner for visiting without an appointment. Osaka Governor Hirofumi Yoshimura urged local residents to report any establishment that remains open after 8 p.m. “We will be unable to control infections if more businesses decide they can do whatever they want,” he said.

0,Experts: Virus cases in Tokyo rising faster than during 4th wave,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"July 2, 2021 at 15:05 JST"," The novel coronavirus is now spreading in Tokyo at a faster pace than during the fourth wave of infections this spring, according to health experts, who called for tighter restrictions on alcohol-serving businesses. The situation in the capital was discussed at a meeting on July 1 of a COVID-19 monitoring panel set up by the Tokyo metropolitan government. The health experts on the panel urged the government to take swift measures to prevent the deteriorating virus situation from straining the medical care system again. The panel found that at least two categories regarding the infection spread in the capital had reached the most serious stage 4. Metropolitan government officials have said they would again ask bars and restaurants to stop serving alcohol if stage 4 levels were reached. Tokyo reported 673 new COVID-19 cases on July 1. That brought the daily average of new infections per 100,000 people to 26.49 for the week ending the same day. A figure of 25 or greater indicates stage 4 for this category. The number of patients recuperating from COVID-19 per 100,000 residents on June 30 was 32, exceeding the stage 4 figure of 30. The hospital bed usage rate for COVID-19 patients as of June 30 was 25 percent, which was still at the second highest stage 3 level. Another finding presented at the meeting was that the daily average of new cases over a week had increased by 20 percent over the previous week. There have now been increases for three straight weeks. The panel experts noted that pedestrian traffic around entertainment districts has risen in comparison to late March. That increase was their basis for warning about the quicker pace of new cases than during the fourth wave. The panel presented a simulation on the situation in Tokyo if new COVID-19 cases continue to rise by more than 20 percent over the previous week. It showed that in four weeks, the daily number of new infections would exceed 1,043. Atsushi Nishida, who heads the Research Center for Social Science and Medicine at the Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Medical Science, reported that over the 10-day period after June 21, when the state of emergency was replaced by pre-emergency measures, nighttime pedestrian traffic around major entertainment districts increased by 21.5 percent. The Asahi Shimbun Between 10 p.m. and midnight over that 10-day period, congestion still increased even though bars and restaurants are supposed to stop serving alcohol at 8 p.m. Nishida said the late-night pedestrian traffic had already reached levels of late March when Tokyo entered the fourth wave of infections. He added that people who remained out until late at night were at greater risk of becoming infected. Metropolitan and central government officials have already raised the possibility of issuing new requests for businesses to stop serving alcohol. But other officials said such calls may no longer be heeded, given the fatigue people are feeling from having to comply with such requests for more than a year. Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike took part in the meeting remotely, the first time she was seen in public since entering a hospital to rest from fatigue on June 22.

0,Spreading virus threatens plans to let spectators attend Olympics,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"July 1, 2021 at 18:55 JST"," The resurgent number of new COVID-19 cases in Tokyo has raised concerns among government officials that the Olympic Games could be held without spectators after all. Health experts on June 30 warned the government against lifting COVID-19 pre-emergency measures for Tokyo as scheduled on July 12, saying newly confirmed infections in the capital have neared the most serious stage 4 level concerning the spread of the virus. They said now is the time for a quick response to the new outbreaks, not an easing of the anti-virus measures. Data from an expert panel advising the health ministry showed the number of new cases per 100,000 people came to 24.59 in Tokyo in the most recent week, up 25 percent from the preceding week. If the number is 25 or higher, it indicates a stage 4 situation. “It would not make sense to lift the pre-emergency measures as scheduled,” said Kazuhiro Tateda, professor of infectious diseases at Toho University and a member of the panel. Tokyo reported 673 new COVID-19 cases on July 1, 103 more than a week ago. It was the 12th straight day for the daily count to increase from the previous week. One factor behind the rising numbers is the spread of the Delta variant, which was first identified in India and is far more contagious than the strain that swept across Japan last year. The National Institute of Infectious Diseases estimates that the Delta variant will cause more than half of all new COVID-19 cases in Japan by the middle of July, up from roughly 30 percent at the end of June. The daily number of new cases in Tokyo will top 1,000 by the end of July, according to an estimate by Kyoto University and the NIID. But that figure was based on the “most optimistic scenario” of a small impact from the Delta variant and no increase in people’s movement during the Summer Games. The Opening Ceremony for the Olympics is scheduled for July 23. The health experts said strong measures to swiftly deal with the current situation, such as declaring another state of emergency, coupled with the acceleration of the vaccination program could help Tokyo keep open more than half of its hospital beds for seriously ill COVID-19 patents. But if such decisions are delayed, hospitals will be flooded with patients, they added. Senior officials of the Suga administration are growing worried about the resurgence in Tokyo because it could jeopardize plans to allow spectators to attend the Olympic Games. The central and Tokyo metropolitan governments, as well as the Tokyo Olympic organizing committee and other organizations, agreed on June 21 to let fans fill half of the competition venues up to a maximum of 10,000 people. The agreement was based on the assumption that pre-emergency measures in Tokyo would be lifted on July 12. But they also decided that holding the Summer Games without spectators would be an option if a fourth state of emergency is declared for the capital or if the pre-emergency period is extended beyond the original deadline. Suga has said he wants the Olympic events to be held with spectators. The prime minister is seeking to avoid declaring a state of emergency because it would effectively rule out allowing spectators in the stands. Such an emergency declaration would also call into question the legitimacy of Suga’s statement that holding the Tokyo Olympics would be “proof that humanity has defeated the novel coronavirus.” If the pre-emergency measures are extended in the capital, the government is expected to make a “political” decision over the spectator number. However, calls have grown for a no-spectator decision if the Games are held under pre-emergency measures. A senior Diet member of Suga’s Liberal Democratic Party said the words “state of emergency” have a negative ring, and they would hurt Japan’s image at home and abroad if such a declaration is in place during the Olympics. An aide to the prime minister, echoing other officials’ views, pointed to a possible solution for the growing health problem: “Vaccines can be game changers.” The vaccine program to inoculate people 65 or older, an age group most susceptible to serious symptoms if infected, has made progress. In Tokyo, patients in their 60s or older represented about 20 percent of new infection cases as of January. But their share dropped to below 10 percent in the most recent week. Some senior members of the Suga administration said the hospital system in the capital could avoid being overstretched if the number of new COVID-19 patients in the vulnerable older age groups declines, even if the overall figure increase. “The coronavirus will become just an ordinary cold if it does not cause severe symptoms,” said a high-ranking official at the prime minister’s office. The official indicated that the administration could sidestep the emergency issuance by citing the status of the health care system, one of factors that must be weighed before deciding on such a declaration. However, such an approach would likely fuel criticism that the Suga administration is putting the Olympics above everything else, including the safety of the people it represents, in the pandemic. More than 14,500 people in Japan have died from COVID-19. “Even if the government says a spike in new cases is no big deal if patients do not become seriously ill, few outside the government will buy it,” said another senior official at the prime minister’s office. “I am afraid that the government will not be able to gain support from health experts, either.” (This article was compiled from reports by Jun Tabushi, Ko Nagata, Kai Ichino, Hiroshi Ishizuka and Kohei Morioka.)",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14385113

Kato said the government held a meeting on the morning of June 30 to explain the new policy to concerned municipalities. He also revealed how the government intends to handle cases where members or staff of an Olympic delegation test positive at airport quarantine checks. Kato said the government plans to identify people who may have come into close contact with the infected individuals while traveling to Japan and transport them to their accommodations separately by bus. According to sources, those found in close contact with an infected individual will be quarantined at a hotel in Tokyo or surrounding prefectures if it takes five hours or more by vehicle from the airport to the team ’ s host town. If it takes less than five hours, the close contacts will be transported to the host town. It takes five hours or more if the host town is about 300 kilometers away, the sources said. The policy will be in place from July 1 through July 12 before the Olympic village opens. Kato previously said officials at the athletes’ host towns would be responsible for coordinating with local public health centers to determine who had been exposed to the virus from athletes or team staff confirmed to be infected by airport quarantine checks. But the government has come under fire after the Ugandan delegation was allowed to travel to their host city, Izumisano, Osaka Prefecture, without undergoing inspection to identify who may have come into close contact with a coach who tested positive at Narita Airport outside Tokyo on June 19.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14384473

0,Japan gives up on restarting workplace vaccine program,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"June 30, 2021 at 17:40 JST"," Japan will abandon restarting its highly touted mass vaccination campaign at workplaces and universities because demand for the doses has far exceeded supply, government sources said. Inundated by applications from companies and universities, the government stopped accepting new ones as of 5 p.m. on June 25. The inoculation campaign uses the Moderna vaccine. Taro Kono, the administrative reform minister who is in charge of the COVID-19 vaccine rollout, has said Japan will not order additional supplies of Moderna vaccines. At a news conference on June 29, Kono said he “will announce a policy of some kind” this week. The announcement will likely be the decision not to restart that vaccination program, according to the sources. The government started scrutinizing the applications to see if companies and universities have requested more doses than they need. But a top official of the prime minister’s office said, “It is difficult to continue using Moderna vaccines for the workplace project.” The government has promised to distribute 50 million doses of the Moderna vaccine, enough to inoculate 25 million people, by the end of September. Of that volume, 33 million doses are expected to go to companies that can inoculate at least 1,000 people as well as universities. The application process began on June 8, and some companies and universities started inoculating staff and students from June 21. As of 5 p.m. on June 25, applications for about 36.42 million doses were filed in the company-university program. According to the sources, the remaining 17 million Moderna doses are expected to be used by local governments. “Any leftover doses should be diverted to the mass vaccination programs of local governments,” the official at the prime minister’s office said. Applications for about 12 million doses have been approved for local governments’ mass vaccination sites, while applications for another 12 million or so doses have been received but approval is pending.

0,Suga’s promise to vaccinate the elderly by August remains elusive,['THE ASAIH SHIMBUN'],"June 30, 2021 at 17:10 JST"," More than half of people 65 or older have now received at least one COVID-19 vaccine shot, government statistics reveal. But the current pace of the rollout raises questions over whether Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga’s goal of having all elderly people who want to receive it complete the two-dose vaccination process by the end of July is within reach. According to data released through the website of the prime minister’s office, about 20.67 million people who are 65 or older, or 58 percent, have received their first dose of the Pfizer vaccine as of June 28. Only about 8.66 million elderly people, or 24 percent, have received two shots and completed the inoculation process. Meanwhile some 14.81 million seniors, or 42 percent, have yet to start the process. Suga declared his “by the end of July” target for the first time at a news conference on April 23, after he decided to issue the third state of emergency for Tokyo and three prefectures. “The government as a whole will undertake the task so that each local government can administer vaccines twice to all elderly people who want to be vaccinated by the end of July,” he said. Suga’s aides were even more optimistic about the timetable. “All elderly people who want to be vaccinated will receive at least the first shot by the end of June,” one aide had said initially. But to meet the government’s end of July deadline, a hefty number of elderly people must receive their first shot by July 10 because the Pfizer vaccine requires a three-week waiting period between administering the first and second shots.

0,"Olympic bus drivers, security guards struggle to get vaccinated",['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"June 28, 2021 at 17:40 JST"," Several hundred thousand people who are expected to play direct roles in the Tokyo Olympics next month have been left out of the loop in the accelerated vaccination process for athletes, organizers and volunteers. Plans to inoculate shuttle bus drivers, security guards and other mainly subcontracted workers before the Games are nowhere in sight. Organizers of the Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics have been informed of the problem, but they have offered no solutions and only reiterated that the Summer Games will “be safe and secure” from the COVID-19 crisis, sources said. In Gifu Prefecture, 27 bus companies are expected to dispatch up to 79 buses and 280 drivers for the Olympic and Paralympic Games. “Almost all of the bus drivers have yet to receive a COVID-19 vaccination voucher,” Yoshiaki Kishino, chairman of the Gifu Prefecture Tourism Federation, said on June 18 at a prefectural government meeting on dealing with the novel coronavirus pandemic. Citing the fact that the vaccine must be administered twice to be effective, Kishino said, “It will not happen in time for the Olympics.” He said he is seeking help from the prefectural officials: “We are trapped in a difficult situation.” Kishino also said the problem “should have been dealt with by” the Tokyo Organizing Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games. But the committee had not given him any answer, except “it’s under review,” he said. Sho Hiraki, vice governor of the central Japan prefecture, made an impromptu decision to administer the first shot to about 130 bus drivers at the Gifu prefectural government’s mass vaccination center by July 4. Bus drivers in Mie Prefecture in the Kinki region have faced a similar challenge. Fourteen bus companies in the prefecture will dispatch vehicles and drivers to help out in the operation of Tokyo Olympics. But many drivers are still waiting to receive a vaccine shot, according to the Mie Bus Association. “Some drivers might say, ‘I don’t mind transporting vaccinated athletes, but I won’t go if it’s a pick-up and drop-off service for members of the media who may not have been vaccinated,’” a representative of the association said. The Olympic organizing committee has not made vaccinations mandatory for people involved in the sporting events. However, the committee has started a project to inoculate staff members and volunteers whose tasks require them to be frequently in close proximity to athletes. Subcontracted worker, such as bus drivers, are left to get the vaccine on their own. In many cases, such subcontractors have relied on their local government’s mass vaccination program. A representative of a bus company in Nagoya said options are limited for local bus companies. Only a few major bus companies in the capital of Aichi Prefecture can inoculate their employees through company-wide vaccination programs, the representative said. The representative’s company is expected to dispatch drivers to the Olympics, but it has no clear idea on when they can get vaccinated. “We are hoping our drivers are allowed to get the vaccine through the workplace vaccination programs of other companies,” the representative said. Time is also running out for many security companies to have their workers inoculated in time for the Olympics. A man in his 30s who lives in Tokyo and is expected to work as a security guard at the Olympics said he received his first dose at a mass vaccination center. But he said many of his colleagues have been unable to even make an appointment. “Being a security guard, I will inevitably come near many and unspecified persons, such as athletes, officials and spectators,” he said. “It is scary to have many unvaccinated security people working at (the Olympics).” About 600,000 security guards are expected to work before, during and after the Olympic and Paralympic Games. The All Japan Security Service Association has asked the central government to give security guards priority in receiving the vaccine. But that has not happened. Despite the concerns of those directly involved, the Olympic organizing committee has taken the stance that there is nothing to worry about. “We have built a testing system to make the event safe without a vaccine,” a top official of the organizing committee said. “We will carefully explain to all staff members that there is no problem if they practice infection control as per usual.”",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14382758

0,"Testing at elderly care facilities expands, but at a snail’s pace",['By TOMOE ISHIKAWA/ Staff Writer'],"June 28, 2021 at 15:25 JST"," The central government’s bid to ramp up COVID-19 testing on caregivers and staff at eldercare facilities to prevent infection clusters has faced delays from some reluctant facilities worried that more rigorous testing could cause staff shortages. The health ministry has urged local governments to conduct regular PCR tests focusing on workers at eldercare facilities, a key coronavirus battleground where most clusters are occurring. Testing has been stepped up, but slowly, with some areas running tests less frequently and many smaller facilities expressing reluctance out of fears positive results could strain their operations. “Small facilities like ours do not have many workers, so it will be difficult to operate the facility if someone tests positive,” said the head of a Tokyo facility. Infections have spread at eldercare facilities like wildfire, government figures show. According to data collected by the health ministry, 1,711 infection clusters had broken out at elderly care facilities nationwide, as of June 21. That number was the largest among the categories, exceeding those from restaurants and bars and health care facilities. In early May, it was revealed that 38 residents died at elderly care facilities in Kadoma, Osaka Prefecture, and Kobe. Focusing testing on workers at such facilities is a measure aimed at discovering asymptomatic COVID-19 patients quicker to prevent infection clusters from occurring. The ministry’s guidelines request that facilities located in areas under a state of emergency or pre-emergency measures test their workers once a week, or at least once every two weeks. But the frequency of testing varies by municipality. During the period from February to March this year, the ministry announced a policy to conduct caregiver-focused testing at facilities in 10 prefectures under the state of emergency. But only about 15,000 facilities actually did the testing, about half of the ministry’s target. In response, the ministry issued a request to facilities in late March to conduct focused testing more actively between April and June. The ministry expanded the number of target facilities to 76,656, including those taking care of disabled people. As of June 2, 47,400 facilities, or 62 percent, requested the testing. The ministry said many facilities reported that they would not conduct the testing due to concerns it would leave them short of workers. Many larger facilities have done the testing, while smaller facilities have tended to express concerns about staff testing positive if they run the tests, the ministry said. “I feel nervous when I conduct tests,” the head of the Tokyo care facility said. “I feel uneasy about whether the facility can stay in operation if someone tests positive for the virus. There are staff who are stressed about the testing.” The facility nonetheless complied with the ministry’s request and tested its staff, but voiced concerns that the burden of testing has increased. An infection cluster broke out at that facility last year, but staff who did not contract the virus had managed to keep the facility running. Yasuhiro Yuki, a social welfare professor at Shukutoku University, said that small facilities do not have close ties with other facilities, and it is difficult for them to bolster their workforce amid a labor crunch if someone tests positive. “There should be a measure for securing manpower (for these small facilities), such as appropriating a budget to dispatch caretakers to a facility that has a COVID-19 case,” he said.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14382671

""The number of new infections in the capital and other areas in the greater Tokyo metropolitan area is clearly trending upward,” Yasutoshi Nishimura, who is also in charge of the government’s novel coronavirus measures, said during a program aired by Japan Broadcasting Corp.

0,The pandemic is making school life a lot harder for children,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"June 28, 2021 at 07:00 JST"," More than a year of the pandemic upending students’ lives has led to reports of an increasing number frequently visiting school nurse’s offices, skipping classes and generally struggling to adapt to their situations. Education facilities imposed strict behavioral restrictions in efforts to contain the pandemic, piling extra stress onto students at elementary and junior high schools who are finding it difficult to share their troubles with adults, according to new data. School nurses, who witness firsthand the effect the pandemic is having on students every day, are feeling a growing sense of crisis about the increasing number of kids unable to cope with the change. “I am surprised at the continuous stream of students coming to the nurse’s office,” said a school nurse at a public junior high school in the Kanto region around Tokyo. The nurse said that every day following the May holiday period, a succession of no fewer than 10 students stopped by their office once morning classes began. The students usually complain they are “feeling sick” and have stomachaches. The academy has fewer than 300 students, but nearly 20 of them--including some who had refused to go to school before the pandemic--are routinely late for class, go home early, and are absent from school for prolonged periods. “The number is larger than usual,” the school nurse said. One student said he did not sleep at all on one school night because he stayed up and “played a video game until morning.” This is just one of many cases of students struggling with being banned from going out and finding themselves increasingly immersed in online environments and video games. “The extension of life with the coronavirus has had an impact on children’s bodies and minds,” said the school nurse. One publicly run elementary school in Tokyo with almost 500 students said nearly 20 children have been unable to leave the nurse’s office, or often do not appear at class. Under normal circumstances, only a few students a year show these troubling signs. The 30-year-old nurse there said the “influence of last year’s nationwide school closure remains,” and noted that educators were unable to determine how their students’ lives and behavior had changed over that period, even though they phoned their homes. It became impossible for the school to respond quickly to family rifts and students’ deteriorating mental health, resulting in some cases of refusing to attend school, according to educators. As all school trips and other events were canceled last year, students were deprived of opportunities to improve their psychological states and human relationships. “Teachers also lost chances to effectively reach out to children,” said the school nurse. “If this continues, it would be no wonder if people consider school to be an unattractive place to go to.” PHYSICAL AND MENTAL STRAIN A teacher at a ward-run junior high school in Tokyo in his 50s said that more children are eating poorly now. Several children in each class ask teachers to reduce the volume of their school lunch and return part of the served meals. He is also concerned about the fact that an increasing number of students are being absent from school about once a week or so, citing reasons such as headaches and feeling ill. Each situation is different depending on the school and region. The school nurse at a public junior high in Saitama Prefecture argued that “fewer students than previously reported are becoming sick now, thanks to the thorough surgical mask use and hand washing practice.” Megumi Tsukakoshi, 49, a school nurse at the junior high school affiliated with a state-run college in the capital, said the physical and mental toll that the prolonged health crisis is exacting on children “will start to fully surface.” Reports of struggling students unwilling to attend class or skipping school tend to crop up more at the junior high level after the end of the summer vacation period. But this year, those instances have been on the rise since the May holiday period. “There are fewer opportunities to engage students in a way that is stimulating under the various restrictions, sapping students’ mental energy,” Tsukakoshi said. According to Tsukakoshi, maladjusted kids often suffer from a lack of emotional energy, and adults remaining unaware of their problems could lead to serious adverse outcomes, including suicides. “Maladjustment is an important sign,” Tsukakoshi warned. “It is essential for us to allocate more time to listen to each child’s problems in person.” LESS PATIENCE, HARDER TO CONCENTRATE Troubling statistics suggest the burden the pandemic is placing on students is getting worse. Hideyuki Tobe, a professor of school health studies at Saitama University, conducted a survey between March and early May this year of 500 school nurses across Japan. More than half said that “more children are failing to adapt to school life, such as by refusing to go to school, frequenting nurses’ offices or feeling reluctant to attend class,” at 54 percent. The ratio in the same survey in July-September last year was 43 percent. Respondents could choose more than one answer. Those who reported “signs of excessive use of video games and the internet” among students accounted for 76 percent--around the same level as in the previous study. According to the survey team, children are “shying away from personal contact while they are wearing masks, rendering it difficult to build strong friendships with others.” As events are also called off, students “cannot find something to pour their passions into.” The team concluded that the “continuation of such school days are behind the issue.” The National Center for Child Health and Development carried out a survey from February through March that asked 501 elementary, junior high and senior high school students about the emotional and mental strain caused by the pandemic. Twenty percent of the students reported harming themselves or their family members, while 37 percent said they now “become easily irritated” and 32 percent said they “cannot concentrate these days.” All those figures increased from the previous study held between September and October last year, in which the rates of students who reported injuries, irritation and being unable to concentrate were 7 percent, 30 percent, and 26 percent, respectively. Respondents who said “it has become more difficult to talk to or consult with teachers and other adults” over the last year reached 51 percent. Mayumi Hangai, a pediatrician who was involved in the survey, said children are resorting to abusive behavior because they do not have an outlet for their emotions under the strenuous circumstances. “Being stuck at home, children feel stress and cannot find ways to relieve it,” said Hangai. “What is significant is discussing how to address the issue together, such as preparing opportunities to listen to children’s opinions over the cancellation of club activities and school events.” (This article was written by Yukihito Takahama and Azusa Mishima.)",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14374113

Social distancing must still be observed, which means fewer seats, tables and customers at bars, restaurants and elsewhere. Tokyo was placed under an initial 17-day state of emergency, the third to be imposed, on April 25. It was supposed to end May 11 but then extended, first to May 31 and later to June 20. Other prefectures faced similar curbs. Health experts have voiced extreme concern about people being able to mingle more freely again in public in the leadup to the Tokyo Olympics next month and growing signs that COVID-19 cases are rising in the Tokyo metropolitan area, along with the presence of more contagious coronavirus variants. But judging by the crowds of pedestrians at the iconic Scramble Crossing at 1:30 p.m. outside Tokyo's Shibuya Station, some even spilling into the road, people are fed up with repeated warnings about safety and simply wanted to have a good time. Benches set up around the nearby world-renowned Hachiko dog statue, a popular meeting spot for couples, were all occupied. A salesclerk at a clothing shop near the packed crossing was not impressed by the return of large crowds, however. “People seem to be letting down their guard,” she said. “I am really worried about a big increase in new cases.” And so, she should be. The latest weekly figure for COVID-19 cases in Tokyo already points to a rebound. Tokyo recorded 534 new cases on June 26, 146 more than a week earlier, according to the metropolitan government. The daily average of new cases over the week through June 26 marked an increase of 26 percent from the preceding week. An estimate of pedestrian flow, gleaned from locations of NTT Docomo Inc. mobile phone users, showed a sharp uptick at nine sites surveyed across the nation on June 26, compared with a week earlier. Between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. that day, 48 percent more people congregated in front of JR Osaka Station, far larger than at other sites surveyed. It was 24 percent near the Shijokawaramachi entertainment district in Kyoto; 12 percent near the Shibuya Scramble Crossing in Tokyo; 16 percent in the vicinity of JR Tokyo Station; 16 percent around JR Nagoya Station; 10 percent near JR Sannomiya Station in Kobe; and 12 percent in the Tenjin district in Fukuoka. Okinawa, the only prefecture still under a state of emergency, also saw an uptick in pedestrian traffic at 6 percent in Kokusaidori, the main street in the prefectural capital of Naha.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14382194

0,2 elite METI officials held for scamming subsidy program,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"June 26, 2021 at 18:30 JST"," Two young career bureaucrats at the economy ministry are under arrest over suspicions they pocketed government funds designed for small businesses reeling from the novel coronavirus pandemic. One of them may have used the money to support an expensive lifestyle, including rent in a high-rise condominium that exceeded his monthly salary, according to investigative sources. Makoto Sakurai and Yutaro Arai were arrested June 25 on suspicion of fraud, officers of Tokyo’s Metropolitan Police Department announced the same day. The pair, both 28, were classmates in senior high school who ended up working in the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry. Sakurai joined the ministry in 2018 and Arai followed two years later. They worked in different divisions of the ministry’s Economic and Industrial Policy Bureau. Police suspect the two of abusing the program overseen by the ministry to provide rent support for small businesses and individual entrepreneurs who suffered sales losses due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the sources said. The approval process for the program may have been lax because of the need to provide financial support as quickly as possible to prevent mass bankruptcies, the sources added. According to investigative sources, the two men posed as associates of a small business from about late December and applied for the rent subsidy payments by submitting image data of fake rental agreements to the special website set up by the ministry for the program. In early January, the pair received a lump sum of about 5.5 million yen ($50,000) deposited in the company’s name. While Arai submitted the application, most of the money was grabbed by Sakurai, who, according to investigative sources, immediately purchased an expensive Swiss watch. Sakurai also owned several expensive foreign cars. Arai established a paper company in November 2019 before joining the ministry and applied for the subsidy under its name. According to the company registration, the address was registered at Arai’s residence. Arai was the founding company president, but the company is now headed by a female relative. In their application, the two claimed to use three offices with a combined rent of about 2 million yen. The actual locations were Arai’s residence, the residence of Arai’s relative and the home where Sakurai grew up. The sales record for the company was also allegedly faked because the company did not appear to conduct any sort of business. Sakurai’s colleagues at the ministry mounted their own investigation because he lived in a condominium in the posh Ichibancho district of Tokyo’s Chiyoda Ward. In a statement, the ministry issued deep regret over the matter and pledged to fully cooperate with the police investigation.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14381793

0,Study: Virus variants make talking up close pose higher risk,['By NAMI SUGIURA/ Staff Writer'],"June 24, 2021 at 18:45 JST"," Researchers are cautioning people about how long they converse face to face as a new study suggests coronavirus variants could transmit in a much shorter time through speech than the original virus. The study was conducted using Fugaku, the world's fastest supercomputer, by the Riken research institute, Kobe University and other universities. “People should be cautious about how long they converse,” said Makoto Tsubokura, professor of computational fluid dynamics at Kobe University, who led the Riken research team. Researchers simulated how droplets containing the coronavirus spread in two cases: when an infected person talked at a normal volume and when they spoke loudly. The infection rates for three types of the novel coronavirus were calculated based on the assumption that two of the variants studied are 1.25 times more contagious and 2.5 times more contagious, respectively, compared with the initial version of the coronavirus that raged for most of last year. The first variant was modeled after the Alpha variant, first identified in Britain, and the second was modeled after the Delta variant, which was first reported in India. The findings showed an increased risk of contracting the virus when people were just 1 meter from an infected individual who spoke loudly for 15 minutes. The researchers estimated the chances of catching the original coronavirus to be more than 20 percent, while the figure is around 30 percent for the Alpha variant and around 50 percent for the Delta virus. If people were 2 meters away, they had about a 20 percent probability of becoming infected with the Delta variant. The infection rate sharply declines for any form of the coronavirus when people kept a distance of more than 2 meters from an infected person. But people should still be careful about conversing over a prolonged period of time, even while social distancing 2 meters apart, the researchers warned. In the case of the Delta variant, the risk posed over the course of a 20-minute conversation was equivalent to those posed by the original novel coronavirus during a 60-minute chat. RISKS AT RESTAURANTS Scientists also simulated the dispersal of droplets at a small restaurant with a counter and tables where 16 people conversed and calculated the risks of contracting the virus if one of them was a carrier. With no precautionary measures in place, some of the people had a nearly 80 percent chance of getting the virus while for others it was almost zero, depending on their position in the room in relation to the infected person. People who were seated to the lee side of the air flow, which is the side sheltered from the wind, were more at risk, according to the findings. When an air conditioner was turned on, droplets containing the coronavirus dispersed more widely. But the overall risk of transmitting the virus lowered as the droplets become less concentrated. Still, the risks became much higher on the lee side of the strong air flow, the research showed. Placing panels dividing people at the counter and those seated across the table, combined with turning the air conditioner on, were found to be helpful in reducing infection risks by about 80 percent, compared with no precautions at all. Panels block droplets and air currents moving upward and downward are created when air expelled from an air conditioner hits the panels, contributing to a drop in risk, according to the research team. “It is important to prevent droplets from concentrating in a certain area and reduce the overall risks in a room,” Tsubokura said. A ceiling fan will be effective in reducing infection risks as it circulates the air upward and downward, he added.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14380232

Newly confirmed infections of the novel coronavirus are “turning upward from staying flat” in Tokyo, the health ministry’s expert panel on the virus said at a meeting on June 23, three days after the COVID-19 state of emergency was lifted in the capital. “The trend (in Tokyo) is already showing signs of a rebound,” health minister Norihisa Tamura warned. According to the health ministry’s data, the number of new COVID-19 cases per 100,000 people for the latest week was 9.26 in Hokkaido, 19.36 in Yamanashi Prefecture, 7.39 in Osaka Prefecture, and 41.02 in Okinawa Prefecture, which remains under a state of emergency. In Tokyo, the number inched up to 19.70 from 19.13 recorded in the previous week. Although nighttime foot traffic in Tokyo’s downtown areas had been rising for five consecutive weeks since the end of the long holiday period in early May, the level decreased by 0.5 percent last week from the previous seven-day period. However, daytime movement of people jumped by 2.4 percent week over week. By June 21, 433 infections of L452R variants, including the Delta variant discovered in India, had been confirmed around Japan through PCR screening tests. The number doubled from 214 marked a week earlier. “In the Tokyo metropolitan area, the number of new cases has stopped falling, and particularly in Tokyo, the number of new cases has increased by about 10 percent over the past week,” Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga said at a June 23 meeting of Cabinet ministers involved in responding to the health crisis. “We need to be strongly vigilant about the rebound.” Tokyo confirmed 619 new cases on June 23, topping 600 for the first time since May 28 and showing an increase of 118 from the figure a week earlier.

Taro Kono, state minister in charge of Japan’s COVID-19 vaccine rollout, said at a news conference on June 23 that the government will suspend new applications from companies and universities as of 5 p.m. on June 25 amid a deluge of applications. The government already stopped taking new requests for Moderna vaccines from local governments for their mass vaccination sites on June 23, Kono also disclosed. He said vaccines will still be delivered for applications that have already been filed and approved. But he did not say when the government will resume accepting new applications. “We have no choice but to run the operation for a while like (we are) closing our eyes and walking a tightrope,” Kono said. “To maintain the current capacity of inoculating as many people as possible, delivering the proper (amount of) vaccines is the most important thing,” he added, pledging that the government will do its best to make that happen. However, a Cabinet member said it will take two to three weeks to scan the remaining applications that have already been filed, which means it is unlikely the government will resume accepting new applications anytime soon. The prime minister’s office started taking applications for the vaccination program at workplaces and universities on its website on June 8. The workplace-inoculation effort started on June 21. The government has said 50 million doses of the Moderna vaccine, enough to inoculate 25 million people, will be supplied by the end of September. Kono said the government has already received applications for about 45 million doses, with 33 million requests from workplaces and universities and 12 million from local governments.

The demonstration was held in front of the Tokyo metropolitan government building in Shinjuku Ward on the evening of June 23, when the number of new infections of the novel coronavirus continued to resurge in the capital. Wearing masks and holding signs with anti-Olympic slogans in Japanese and English, the protesters chanted, “End the Olympic Games that destroy people’s lives.” One sign read, “Cancel the money-tainted Olympics.” Another said, “Use funds set aside for the Olympics on measures to contain the coronavirus.” The demonstration was organized by civic groups that have long opposed the Tokyo Olympic and Paralympic Games. One of the organizers said similar rallies were scheduled to be held in South Korea, Paris and Los Angeles. Another rally held nearby supported the holding of the Tokyo Olympics. “If you can gather like this, there will be no problem holding the Summer Games,” one of the supporters said. The Tokyo Olympics are scheduled to open on July 23, despite continuing health concerns about the novel coronavirus and opinion polls indicating a majority of the public wants the event postponed again or canceled. An analysis of social media data by The Asahi Shimbun using Brandwatch showed that the number of tweets and retweets with hashtags opposing the Tokyo Games, including “#This is no time to stage the Olympics,” stood at more than 97,000 between Jan. 1 and 11 a.m. on June 23. The spread of such tweets surged in the middle of this month, including more than 51,000 on June 20 alone. Mitsuko Uenishi, a professor of labor issues at Hosei University in Tokyo who advocates close scrutiny of Diet discussions, has posted eight comments on Twitter about the Olympics. In a June 21 tweet, she urged the public not to view the holding of the Tokyo Games as a “done deal.” “In mountain climbing, you must not rush to the summit, even if it is so close, once you sense danger,” she said. “There are myriad problems in holding the Olympics. Japan’s preparedness is inadequate in receiving athletes and officials from overseas and in dealing with the coronavirus. The government makes light of experts’ opinions. The problems are so obvious that I will never remain silent.” Her tweet was read by an estimated 234,000 internet users, according to the Brandwatch analysis.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14380094

Izumisano officials announced June 23 that a Ugandan athlete in their 20s tested positive for the virus through a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test on June 22. The coach was found to be infected after a PCR test at the airport outside Tokyo on June 19 when the team arrived in Japan. The fact that the team was permitted to leave the airport afterward has incited criticism from lawmakers and heads of local governments, questioning if the anti-virus border control measures and “bubble” promised by the Tokyo Olympics organizers to contain infections are working. Osaka Governor Hirofumi Yoshimura on June 22 said that the rest of the team “were supposed to be kept at Narita.” Izumisano Mayor Hiroyasu Chiyomatsu said that day that the airport's quarantine officers should have identified who had been in close contact with the coach at an early stage. Izumisano's prefectural health center has begun trying to determine who came into close contact with the athlete who tested positive. City officials who traveled to Narita Airport to welcome the team have been ordered to self-quarantine at home. The delegation of nine arrived at Narita on the evening of June 19. Despite all members having all their required documents and vaccination records, the coach's PCR test came back positive. The remaining eight tested negative in antigen tests, but quarantine officers did not check the members to ascertain if they had been in close contact with the coach during the long flight to Japan. The team was allowed to leave and arrived at a hotel in Izumisano, their pre-Olympic training camp site, on June 20 by chartered bus. They have been self-isolating in the hotel, subjected to daily PCR testing, according to the city.

No additional tests were performed on the remaining eight team members after they tested negative in antigen tests given at the airport outside Tokyo. Lawmakers voiced doubts about the decision not to quarantine the entire Ugandan delegation before they left the airport during a meeting with government officials on June 21. “Seeing as the other eight individuals traveled together with the person who tested positive, it is surely reasonable to assume that they were all in close contact,” said a lawmaker with the main opposition Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan who questioned the health screening setup at airports. “They should not have been allowed to leave the airport.” Hordes of Olympians, coaches and officials will descend on Tokyo next month for the Summer Games that kick off July 23. The Ugandan team arrived at Narita around 6 p.m. on June 19. All the members had documentation showing they had been fully vaccinated prior to departure and had tested negative for COVID-19. However, a coach was found to be infected after a PCR test was given at the airport. The PCR test was performed as a safeguard after an earlier antigen test did not produce a definitive result. The other delegation members tested negative in antigen tests and were not required to undergo an additional PCR test. They left the airport by chartered bus early June 20 to reach the team's training site in Izumisano city, Osaka Prefecture. Officials in Izumisano announced June 22 that the eight members and a city employee who accompanied the team from Uganda are having their health condition monitored constantly due to fears they might have been exposed to the novel coronavirus. The prefectural health center there identified them as a group at risk. So far, they have all tested negative during daily PCR tests, according to officials. Quarantine officers at Narita did not check the members to ascertain if they had been in close contact with the coach during the long flight to Japan. The team arrived at a hotel in Izumisano later that morning, having been driven nonstop. They are effectively self-isolating in the hotel, according to city officials. During the June 21 meeting, health ministry officials said the task of identifying individuals at risk of having become infected with the virus lies with local public health officials wherever team members are staying. “Local authorities are supposed to determine who has been in close contact based on information on passengers that airlines provide to the central government,” said one official. But another lawmaker took issue with the ministry’s approach, likening it to passing the buck to a public health center in a local region. In Osaka, a prefectural official expressed anger over the central government’s decision to permit the Ugandan team to leave the airport, saying it posed an unacceptable risk if the virus has already been passed to other members during the journey from the airport in Chiba Prefecture. “Since the infection of one person was confirmed at Narita Airport, the central government should have identified who were at risk of contracting the virus,” the prefectural official said. According to the health ministry, passengers seated within two rows of an infected individual during a flight are required to have their health monitored on a regular basis upon arrival in Japan. The public health center in Izumisano said identifying such individuals is possible if information is made available, such as physical distance of others who were seated close by, whether they wore masks and how long they spent chatting with the infected individual.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14378442

0,"Bars, customers question point of new rules on serving alcohol",['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"June 22, 2021 at 18:14 JST"," The lifting of the COVID-19 state of emergency in Tokyo allowed businesses to serve alcohol for the first time in about two months, but continued restrictions dampened the spirit of both operators and customers. In Tokyo and six prefectures where the emergency state ended on June 20, pre-emergency measures took effect the following day. In the capital, those curbs include serving only groups of one or two customers, and limiting the drinking time to less than 90 minutes. The same pre-emergency measures were also extended for the three prefectures of Saitama, Chiba and Kanagawa that neighbor Tokyo. Those affected questioned whether the measures would do anything to prevent the spread of novel coronavirus infections or how to enforce such rules. Others said the curbs have led to confusion. A woman in her 30s who was enjoying some drinks with a co-worker on a terrace table of an “izakaya” pub in the Akabane district in Tokyo’s Kita Ward, gave her opinion on the efficacy of the pre-emergency measures. “If I am asked to leave 90 minutes later, I will just find another place to drink,” she said. “It is questionable how effectively such measures can prevent the virus from spreading.” Akabane, which is filled with small drinking establishments tightly packed together, is known for places where one can “get drunk with only 1,000 yen ($9).” One izakaya in the area said that when it asked groups of three to split up, the would-be customers decided to drink elsewhere. “I am thankful that we can offer alcohol, but whether we can recover sales is unknown,” the 35-year-old manager of the izakaya said. In Saitama and Kawaguchi cities in Saitama Prefecture, customers are asked to drink alone or only with family members who live together. Around JR Kawaguchi Station, one train stop north of Akabane, a woman in her 50s visited the Kakuuchi Arai Shoten bar and also expressed doubts about the effectiveness of the rules. “If somebody wants to drink with another person, I think they will go to the nearby Akabane district,” the part-time employee said. The thirtysomething owner of an izakaya around the train station said it is difficult to know whether customers are in the same family and if they actually live together. “Honestly speaking, even if they don’t meet the requirements, it is difficult to refuse customers’ requests for alcohol,” he said. The lifting of the state of emergency allowed major izakaya operators to restart their businesses. Pub operator Kichiri & Co. had suspended operations of 50 establishments, half of its businesses, during the state of emergency. Masaki Tsunoji, a sales promotion official of the reopened Kichiri izakaya pub in Tokyo’s Shinjuku district, said, “The state of emergency that just ended should be the last one.” Restaurant operator Watami Co., Colowide Co., which runs the Amataro izakaya chain, Syoya izakaya chain operator Daisyo Corp., and British-style pub operator Hub Inc. partially restarted their businesses on June 21. Alcohol-serving restrictions differ according to area, so each izakaya chain is checking how their establishments should respond to those requirements. “Service staff shoulder a heavier burden in explaining the rules to customers, which might cause trouble,” an izakaya chain spokesman said.

Local governments were notified of the guidelines on June 22. In May, the ministry decided to include children aged 12 to 15 in the central government’s vaccination project, which uses the Pfizer vaccine. But to prevent identifying children who refuse a vaccination, the ministry has decided not to encourage local governments to conduct a school-wide inoculation. Instead, children are urged to go to a primary care doctor or a vaccination site run by local governments. If a school decides to conduct a mass vaccination, it should be planned during a summer break and not during classes to prevent peer pressure. It has been reported that both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, which are currently used in Japan, are highly effective and safe. Initially, the Pfizer vaccine was authorized to use for people who are 16 or older. But after additional clinical trials, the vaccine is allowed to be used for those 12 or older from June. But it is believed that younger people more often tend to report experiencing pain and a fever after being inoculated. According to an interim report that surveyed about 20,000 health care workers in Japan who received a Pfizer vaccine, younger people more frequently tend to develop a fever higher than 37.5 degrees, a headache or suffer from fatigue. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), post-vaccination adverse reactions vary slightly by age group in the United States. About 10,000 people who are between 16 and 25 reported an adverse reaction. Among these, 22 percent cited dizziness, 18 percent complained of a headache, 16 percent reported a fever and 16 percent noted feeling nausea. About 1,500 children who are between 12 and 15 reported an adverse reaction. Among these, 28 percent felt dizziness, 21 percent reported fainting, 10 percent reported their skin turning pale and 9.5 percent experienced a loss of consciousness. During the same period, about 3.26 million vaccine shots were administered to children between the ages of 12 to 15. As a whole, such reports of adverse reactions are rare. The Japan Pediatric Society on June 16 released its recommendations on vaccinating children. The society said it is meaningful for children to be vaccinated. It added that it is ideal for them to be vaccinated individually under the assumption that the parents and child fully understand the pros and cons of the vaccine and that meticulous care is provided before, during and after the vaccination. “It is important to prevent an adverse reaction from occurring by offering a full pre-vaccination explanation to calm the nerves,” the society said. Takashi Nakano, a professor in pediatrics at Kawasaki Medical School, said, “Young people are more likely to feel nervous and stressed before and after getting a vaccination and faint more than other age groups.” (This article was written by Kazuyuki Ito, Junya Sakamoto and Kenta Noguchi.)",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14378399

0,Geisha facing dire straits as virus scares off Kyoto customers,['By SATOKO ONUKI/ Staff Writer'],"June 22, 2021 at 07:00 JST"," KYOTO--Geisha and their ""maiko"" trainees are being forced out of work here as the COVID-19 pandemic rages on, shutting down parties where the traditional artists make their living entertaining guests by playing music and dancing. Parties have been scrapped in all five major ""kagai"" traditional entertainment districts here, leading some of the women, collectively known as ""geimaiko,"" to quit the business. ""Last year, I made only 10 percent of my usual income. I have to dip into my savings to pay my daily expenses,"" said a geisha based in the Kamishichiken district. The number of geisha parties declined sharply due to the first state of emergency issued in spring 2020 and during the third state of emergency that ended on June 20, almost no parties were held. While maiko trainees are postponing their debuts, some geimaiko have chosen to leave the kagai districts, citing drastically reduced incomes and uncertainty about the future. The number of geisha, called ""geiko"" in Kyoto, working in the five districts fell from 169 in March 2020 to 161 in March 2021, while the number of maiko declined from 81 to 68, according to the Kyoto Traditional Art Foundation, a public interest foundation working to preserve and pass down the kagai district culture. According to insiders, an increasing number of ""shikomi-san"" (prospective trainees) have also postponed their maiko debuts. ""With no geisha parties being held due to the coronavirus, some geiko have quit, saying that they didn't know what to expect in the future,"" said the Kamishichiken-based geiko. Usually, she would find her appointment book filled with party dates between March and April, largely thanks to a series of ""Kitano Odori"" dance performances. But the spring tradition has been canceled for two straight years now. She also canceled her dance and music lessons to avoid close contact with others. ""I had always worn kimono every day for lessons and parties ever since I was a 'shikomi' after graduating from high school, but it is my first year not wearing kimono on so many occasions,"" she said with a wry smile. While the kagai districts continue to be in dire straits, geisha are the ones hit hardest by the pandemic. While they work as maiko, their rents, groceries and other living expenses are shouldered by ""okiya"" geisha lodging houses. But when they go independent as geiko, they become self-employed and their main source of income are ""hanadai"" party fees that their clients pay them, which have evaporated due to the lack of parties. Teahouse associations have made various efforts to provide support for geiko, helping them apply for government pandemic relief money and setting up a no-interest loan program. The Kyoto Traditional Art Foundation also provided financial support to teahouse associations in April 2020 and again in January this year so that each geimaiko could receive a total of 120,000 yen ($1,100) in a lump-sum payment. But many geiko are still suffering from financial difficulties because they are not eligible for compensation or other support for restaurant operators. ""Teahouses can receive government support money each day because they are restaurants, but there is no compensation for geiko to support their daily living,"" said Saburo Nakanishi, a board member of the teahouse association for the Gion-Higashi district. Nor can the women turn to husbands for support during the current lean times. In Kyoto's geisha districts, it is a long-standing tradition for geimaiko to retire when they marry. For that reason, many geiko are living alone to keep their jobs. ""We don't know when this situation will come to an end,"" said a geiko working in the Pontocho district who performs under the name Ichiwaka . ""I become nervous when I'm all alone in my room with no lessons and parties to give."" A geiko named Momino, who heads an association for geiko working in Pontocho, said she also has a lot of concerns about life after the pandemic. ""I'm not sure whether we can present the same Kamogawa Odori performance as before because we have a lower number of geimaiko. Parties are all about opening up with each other and becoming close to one another by drinking together, but we may have to come up with new ways of entertaining guests,"" she said.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14366877

0,PCR testing on sewage water from offices for early discovery,['By KAZUHITO SUWA/ Staff Writer'],"June 21, 2021 at 08:00 JST"," KYOTO--A subsidiary of precision equipment maker Shimadzu Corp. is offering to perform polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests on raw sewage running from buildings to more quickly track locations where the novel coronavirus is present. As the virus that causes COVID-19 is known to exist in the feces of infected individuals before they develop symptoms, the company said it can identify likely problem locations through sewage checks. Shimadzu Techno-Research Inc. recommends that all users of targeted buildings be checked at a medical institution if sewage water tests prove positive. The company said its method is a cheaper and more efficient way to locate infected individuals compared with conducting mass testing at the start. The service involves company personnel placing absorbent cotton wrapped in netting down sewage manholes within the premises of a client's building for 24 hours before conducting PCR tests on the absorbed water. It said results would be known a few days after collection. Regular testing would result in earlier discovery, the company said. Shimadzu Techno-Research recommended that facilities for the elderly, schools and accommodation facilities use its service. The company charges a basic service fee of 70,000 yen ($640) each time it is called in. It also charges for transportation at the time of collecting samples and other fees. The two-step testing, which the company calls the “Kyoto model,” has already received nearly 100 inquiries from across the nation, the company said.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14369972

0,Koike puts kibosh on public viewing events during Olympics,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"June 19, 2021 at 18:56 JST"," Taking note of calls by health experts dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic, Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike announced June 19 that all plans by the metropolitan government to organize public viewing events during the Olympics would be canceled. Initially, the metropolitan government had planned to hold public viewing events at six locations in the capital, including Yoyogi Park, Inokashira Park, Hibiya Park and Ueno Park. The proposal submitted June 18 by experts, including some on the panel advising the government on steps to combat the health crisis, called for cancelling the events designed mainly to cheer on athletes outside of sports venues. Experts said the events would result in large numbers of people congregating, adding to the risk of spreading infections. The metropolitan government announced earlier that the Yoyogi Park site would instead be used as a mass COVID-19 vaccination center. Koike said June 19 that a similar plan is now in the works for Inokashira Park. In place of the public viewing events, the metropolitan government will consider ways of using the internet to generate enthusiasm for the Olympics while the Games are on. Prior to meeting with reporters to make her announcement, Koike met with Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga for about an hour. She explained that they discussed a planned meeting on June 21 to decide how many spectators to allow in for Olympic events as well as the COVID-19 infection situation in Tokyo. “I believe various measures are needed (such as cancelling public viewing) in order to ensure the Tokyo Olympics are a success,” Koike told reporters. “I also gained the understanding of the prime minister.”",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14376644
0,Ball now in Suga’s court on issue of fans in Olympic stands,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"June 19, 2021 at 15:28 JST"," The message from a group of top health experts could not be clearer: For safety's sake, don't allow spectators at the Tokyo Olympics due to start late next month. Now, it is up to the government to decide whether to heed this advice, even as pre-emergency steps are scheduled to replace a months-long state of emergency that will expire on June 20. The proposal submitted June 18 by the experts starkly spelled out a preference for not allowing any spectators at the Games that kick off July 23. The central government and Olympic organizing committee must now grapple with how many, if any, spectators can attend the various Olympic events. The sports extravaganza has already been delayed by a year because of the health crisis. The scale of pedestrian traffic during an Olympics goes well beyond what occurs during professional baseball and soccer games. The largest number of tickets sold for a single day for events to be held in Tokyo and its three neighboring prefectures already stands at about 430,000. In comparison, baseball stadiums in the four prefectures on average attract 47,000 or so fans a day, while the J.League has about 7,000 fans in the four prefectures on a typical day. The proposal submitted by Shigeru Omi, chairman of the panel of experts advising the government on the novel coronavirus pandemic, and other health experts cited the increased flow of people during the Olympics as representing a major risk for spreading infections. The proposal was submitted less than 24 hours after Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga expressed his intention to allow fans to the Olympic events. However, a close associate of Suga clearly took the experts’ proposal to heart, noting that “it is based on scientific knowledge, so spectators should not be allowed in.” Ignoring the recommendations of experts badly hurt the Suga Cabinet's standing in public opinion polls last autumn during the third wave of COVID-19 cases. The administration pushed ahead with its ""Go To Travel"" tourism promotion campaign and the ensuing surge in new COVID-19 cases resulted in  plunging approval ratings for the Suga Cabinet. There are already signs in Tokyo of a fifth wave of infections. A similar surge of cases due to greater pedestrian traffic during the Olympics prompted  one executive of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party to say, “The prime minister will have to assume the political responsibility.” While polls have consistently shown that 70 percent of the public is against holding the Olympics while the pandemic is raging, Suga has clung to the view that a successful outcome would bolster the LDP’s chances in the Lower House election that must be held this autumn. He and other LDP lawmakers still favor spectators in the stands for Olympic events, if for no other reason than the positive impact that would have on the economy. But with pre-emergency curbs to be implemented for Tokyo from June 21 until July 11, there are growing concerns about what should be done in the event those measures have to be extended until the Olympics. “If those measures cannot be lifted (in time for the Olympics), the option of no fans in the stands cannot be dismissed,” said one high-ranking government source. The general consensus is that a difficult political decision will have to be made regarding the spectator issue. An online meeting involving representatives of the central and Tokyo metropolitan governments, the Tokyo Olympic organizing committee as well as the International Olympic Committee and International Paralympic Committee will be held June 21 to decide how many spectators to allow. The organizing committee’s own roundtable of experts dealing with the pandemic met June 18 after receiving the proposal from Omi and agreed that a flexible approach was needed that could allow for changes to how many spectators are allowed depending on the level of new COVID-19 cases. Some of the experts who joined in submitting the proposal admitted that their gut feeling was for no spectators at the Olympics. “Our fundamental stance from the start was ‘no spectators,’” one expert said. “But the proposal would not have been accepted if we said that, so we also included the conditions that would have to be met in order to allow in some fans.” Criticism was also raised that the proposal came too late, as government officials were already talking about allowing spectators. Omi explained at the June 18 news conference that many of the experts wanted to present the proposal only after considering the latest data about new COVID-19 cases.

The agency bought the equipment in the hope that its use at meeting rooms and other areas in the National Stadium in Tokyo, where the Opening and Closing Olympic ceremonies are due to be held, would help keep staff members and others safe from novel coronavirus infection. But experts took issue with the JSA because the purchase could be taken to show the technology has the full endorsement of the government. Manufacturers of such appliances are not permitted under the drug and medical equipment law to promote such devices as helpful in combating viral infections. “The purchase presents a problem because it sounds as if the technology has obtained the full endorsement of the government,” said Narumi Hori, a nurse who offers consultation services to stop infectious diseases from spreading. “I would advise the agency to take appropriate steps without being deceived by suppliers’ advertisements.” Hori accused manufacturers of playing on the public's fears about becoming infected. “They are spurring consumers’ fears,” she said. “They are only adding to the burden on people and society, and as such, their behavior is entirely inappropriate.” The agency said it initially considered purchasing robotic anti-virus equipment that uses artificial intelligence (AI) to purify the air, but dropped the plan in light of objections from the health ministry. The ministry’s only recommended method to keep airborne viruses at bay is “frequent ventilation.” “We didn't research air sterilization technology properly,” conceded an agency representative in reference to earlier plans to snap up AI robotic technology. However, it went ahead with the purchase of atmospheric purifiers billed as having the ability to disinfect the air under the rationale that “ventilating venues as much as possible” presented a viable option. The agency allocated 2 billion yen ($18.3 million) in the third supplementary budget last fiscal year for “steps against the novel coronavirus infection at the National Stadium and elsewhere.” The “air disinfection” technology was included in the funding plan. The budget is aimed partly to ensure there will be a sufficient number of air cleaners at the National Stadium to keep people safe.

Kawasaki city said it will use spare doses to avoid a delay in the schedule of its vaccination program. The vaccine used by the city was developed by U.S. pharmaceutical company Pfizer Inc. and German partner BioNTech, and it must be stored in temperatures of minus 60 to minus 90 degrees. A city official visiting a storage site for vaccine doses in the city heard an alarm blaring from the freezer in question at 8:10 a.m. on June 13, according to the city government.

ANA’s campaign comes as the government steps up calls for inoculations across the business sector, part of a larger effort to swiftly vaccinate as many as people as possible, not just health care workers and senior citizens. ANA said it was able to move up the start to June 13 as supplies of Moderna vaccines, related storage equipment and vaccination venues had been secured after the company accelerated preparations for the program.

ANA said about 46,500 employees within the ANA group are eligible for jabs. On June 13, the company expected to administer shots to about 50 employees. It plans to expand the capacity to 300 a day at a later date. Japan Airlines Co. plans to begin an in-house vaccination program at Haneda Airport on June 14.

The government’s task force team on June 10 approved the lifting of the pre-emergency measures for the three prefectures as COVID-19 cases continue falling there. The three prefectures will not ask eating and drinking establishments to refrain from serving alcohol, but will continue to request those in many areas to reduce their operating hours. At a task force meeting on June 10, Gunma prefectural officials decided to maintain the highest level of the local alert system from June 14 to 20. It will also continue to ask all restaurants and bars in the prefecture to close by 8 p.m. Under the quasi-emergency measures, eating and drinking establishments in 10 municipalities, including Maebashi and Takasaki cities, have been asked not to serve alcohol the entire day. From June 14, they will be able to offer alcoholic beverages until 7 p.m. “We would like to prevent a rebound in cases,” Gunma Governor Ichita Yamamoto said at a news conference on June 10. “We would like to restart economic activities cautiously and gradually.” At a meeting on June 9, Ishikawa Governor Masanori Tanimoto told people associated with a shopping street in Kanazawa city that he knows the quasi-emergency measures have been difficult for businesses. “I think that they have been extremely tough, but the infection situation is improving,” Tanimoto said. The governor has been asking restaurants and bars in the prefecture to close by 9 p.m., and requesting those in Kanazawa city to close by 8 p.m. and to stop serving alcohol as the prefecture’s capital has recorded nearly half of the local infection cases.

0,"Quasi-emergency needed in Osaka after June 20, governor says",['By YUKI KUBOTA/ Staff Writer'],"June 11, 2021 at 14:55 JST"," OSAKA--Osaka Governor Hirofumi Yoshimura believes quasi-emergency measures should remain in place to deal with the novel coronavirus pandemic even after the state of emergency is lifted on the June 20 deadline. In an exclusive interview with The Asahi Shimbun, Yoshimura reflected on the haste at which infection prevention measures were relaxed soon after the second state of emergency and blamed that move for the sudden surge in COVID-19 cases from late March. “Rather than return to a normal situation (after the state of emergency is lifted), I believe quasi-emergency measures should be in place,” Yoshimura said. He said the Osaka prefectural government was considering asking the central government to implement quasi-emergency measures once the state of emergency is lifted. After the second state of emergency was lifted on March 1, the Osaka prefectural government ended its request for bars and restaurants to voluntarily shorten their business hours in areas outside Osaka city. But that move, combined with the approach of spring vacation for students and a period of personnel transfers at companies in late March and early April led to a sharp increase in pedestrian traffic. That, in turn, caused a spike in novel coronavirus infections from late March and from April 13, Osaka Prefecture recorded more than 1,000 new cases daily. That put a tremendous strain on the medical care system and from late April until early May only about 10 percent of those recuperating at home or other accommodations were able to enter hospitals for treatment. The Osaka prefectural government has labeled the period after March 1 the fourth wave of infections. By June 9, Osaka had logged 1,367 deaths from COVID-19, the largest number for a prefecture in Japan. Osaka accounted for about 20 percent of the 5,956 total fatalities during that period. The Osaka prefectural government established its own standards for deciding whether to ask the central government to lift the state of emergency in March. But Yoshimura said partly due to his own insufficient explanation of what those standards meant, “A belief emerged among Osaka residents that they would be able to (move around more freely).” The most dangerous time for a prefecture is when the mood in society is that “everything is all right,"" he added. ""But it is difficult to stop such thinking from emerging.” Based on that experience, Yoshimura said there was a need to have a common understanding among Osaka residents that infection prevention measures would only gradually be relaxed. That meant the quasi-emergency measures were needed, he added. Such measures were implemented in Osaka from April 5 and bars and restaurants in Osaka city were asked to close at 8 p.m. while other establishments in the prefecture were asked to shut down at 9 p.m. After the third state of emergency was implemented from April 25, it took about two weeks for COVID-19 numbers to drop in Osaka. While the numbers have fallen under 200 per day since June 4, Yoshimura raised more concerns about the mutant coronavirus strain first found in India. He said caution had to be exercised from mid- to late-July as students will enter their summer vacation breaks and there would be more movement among families and young people. “If the India strain should spread during that period, we could end up with the same situation (as the fourth wave),” Yoshimura said. “I feel there is the possibility of a fifth wave at that time because vaccines will still not have reached a large portion of the population.”",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14370719

Chiba Governor Toshihito Kumagai on June 10 briefed reporters on the decision to scrap events in his prefecture. “The purpose of holding the viewing events was to share the inspiration and excitement of the Games and promote the appeal of the prefecture,” he said. “But in the midst of novel coronavirus infections spreading, such a purpose will be unachievable. From the standpoint of controlling the costs, I thought a decision needed to be made quickly.” According to the prefectural government, public viewing events were scheduled for Makuhari Kaihin Park in Chiba’s Mihama Ward on July 31 and Aug. 1 for Olympic events, as well as on Aug. 28 and 29 for Paralympic events. As many as 3,000 people were expected to watch the Games live on a large LCD screen, the city said. On-stage performances by elementary and junior high school children were planned, while neighboring municipalities hoped to hold promotional events for local products. The prefectural government budgeted 90 million yen ($822,000) for staging the events. Kumagai followed Saitama Governor Motohiro Ono, who announced the cancellation of Olympic-related events in his prefecture just days earlier. Ono said at a news conference on June 7 that the public viewing events that the prefectural government had planned were called off. “It is very sad, but I made the decision as the host,” Ono said. Viewing events were scheduled at Sonic City in Saitama’s Omiya Ward from July 31 to Aug. 8, as well as at a public sports complex in the city of Asaka from Aug. 28 to Sept. 5. The prefectural government estimated about 11,000 visitors would be drawn to the two sites. Meanwhile, Tokyo lost another iconic landmark from the venues hosting public viewing events. Tokyo’s Sumida Ward on June 8 announced the cancellation of viewing events scheduled at Tokyo Skytree Town, the tallest structure in Japan, at 634 meters. The ward office said it made the decision to “prioritize the residents’ health and safety.” Shigeru Omi, the head of a government pandemic-response panel, on June 9 said in a Lower House committee meeting that public viewing events should not be held. “There are other ways to cheer on (the athletes),” Omi said, adding that through TV and other means he hopes people find a new way of enjoying the Games together. Facing strong criticism, the Tokyo metropolitan government on June 1 canceled plans to use Yoyogi Park for viewing events during the Olympics, but not for five other locations.

0,Municipalities get angry calls for offering jabs to teenagers,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"June 10, 2021 at 18:51 JST"," INE, Kyoto Prefecture--This small town has been flooded with phone calls from around Japan questioning the decision by officials here to inoculate teenagers against the novel coronavirus. Town officials contacted the police following one phone call that they deemed a death threat. Ine, with a population of about 2,000, began vaccinating students aged 12 to 15 on June 6 after the health ministry added the age group to the list of those eligible for free access to the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. But the town’s call center dealing with the vaccination schedule has been inundated with phone calls assailing giving a jab to junior high school and other students since June 7, when the news media reported on the town's program. The call center was forced to shut down 30 minutes after opening at 9 a.m. that day. Town officials said that they received about 110 phone calls, 36 emails and eight faxed texts from across Japan by late at night on June 7. Many of them were inquiring if it was safe to immunize children, officials said. But some equated vaccinating children with murder. An official in charge of the vaccination program blamed the reaction on a lack of understanding about the health ministry's expanded eligibility for receiving jabs. The town initially planned to vaccinate students across the board, but it has now changed its policy to inoculate only students who wished to receive the shots and whose parents gave consent. The shift, following numerous calls and emails raising doubts about immunizing the youth, is intended to make it clear that students are receiving shots out of their own choice. About 50 residents in Ine are aged 12-15. The town began rolling out a vaccine to residents aged 16 through 64 from May 30, after starting with vaccinations of people aged 65 or older. Strong reactions against inoculating young students have taken place in other municipalities as well. Komaki city and Togo town in Aichi Prefecture were met with protests calling for a halt when they announced prioritized vaccination of junior and high school students. Komaki had received 30 calls and 20 emails as of June 9, two days after the city announced the plan to give inoculations to students. Officials said most of those calls and emails came from outside the city, including from Tokyo and Nagano Prefecture. Officials will allow students to get vaccinated only after they and their parents give consent. The Togo town hall had received more than 100 calls in protest by June 9, after officials said June 4 they would send a vaccination coupon to third-year high school students as a priority. The callers either questioned the soundness of inoculating teenagers or criticized vaccinating them as they are less likely to develop serious symptoms if they catch the virus. Okushiri, an island in Hokkaido, is also experiencing a backlash from the public following the town government’s announcement to inoculate high school students who wish to get the shots from as early as late June. Tetsushi Yoshikawa, professor of pediatrics at Fujita Health University in Aichi Prefecture, underscored the significance of inoculating children. “Children aged 12 to 15 also need to be given a jab,” he said. “If they are vaccinated, they could avoid class or school closures.” He also said doctors should fully inform teenagers who are considering getting a shot about the vaccines before allowing them to get one.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14369992
0,School activities? Nope. Olympic event at leprosy center? A-OK,['By MAYUMI UJIOKA/ Senior Staff Writer'],"June 10, 2021 at 18:40 JST"," A city in western Tokyo is giving pandemic-frustrated children a chance to release pent-up enthusiasm and stifled excitement by attending an Olympic torch relay ceremony held at a sanitarium for leprosy patients. Schoolchildren in Higashimurayama city have seen many of their school activities canceled as a precaution against the spread of the novel coronavirus in the capital. But city officials have asked children at elementary and junior high schools to join the ceremony to welcome the Olympic torch’s arrival on the evening of July 13. Bewildered teachers and parents questioned the city’s decision. “Why in the world is there an exception in the case of the Olympics?” one of them asked. City officials have insisted that attendance “is not mandatory.” The torch ceremony will be held at Tama Zenshoen, a national sanitarium for leprosy patients, which has suspended annual visits of school children to avoid the risk of novel coronavirus infections. The event is being hosted by the Tokyo Organizing Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games and is scheduled to start at 4:30 p.m. and end at 7:30 p.m. Under the city’s initial plan, 2,000 to 3,000 schoolchildren would attend the Olympic torch ceremony. But the COVID-19 pandemic prompted the city to halve the number of attendees. On May 31, the principals of 22 elementary and junior high schools in the city received a request from the Higashimurayama government to each select two children and their parents or guardians to attend the event. The city explained that the ceremony will provide an opportunity for children “to welcome the torch’s arrival together, deliver smiles and think about the importance of human rights and the realization of an inclusive society.” But many principals were not comfortable with the explanation. A principal of a junior high school said discussions among educators about the invitation were like: “It’s difficult. What should I do? What will you do?” The principal decided to let all of the school’s students know about the invitation because  “some parents and students might be willing to attend because it is a once-in-a-lifetime event.” Noting that the torch ceremony falls under the “after-school activity” category, the principal said, “Attend or not to attend, it is up to the parents to decide.” So far, 18 people at the school said they wanted to attend. The principal said there will be a lottery to select the attendees. Another school, using email, only notified parents of sixth-graders about the city’s invitation. According to a school representative, the email said: “This request came from the city. It is the parents’ choice to attend the event or not. The school has nothing to do with it.” The school recently selected attendees in a drawing. Another principal of an elementary school said the school has declined the invitation. “Initially, we thought we had to select attendees,” the principal said. “But then we heard from the city that it is not mandatory. We saw a risk of infections, as well as a problem in the selection process. After discussing the matter with teachers, we declined.” Parents and teachers have also raised questions about the city’s decision. A 38-year-old woman said her child’s elementary school has canceled or suspended many school activities out of safety concerns. “It doesn ’t make sense that only the torch relay event gets the OK,” she said. She also expressed fears that the virus could spread during the torch welcoming ceremony. “What happens if it becomes an infection cluster? They can’t just say, ‘We don’t know,’ because they are calling for participants through the schools.” Another mother, 34, whose child attends a junior high school in the city, expressed mixed feelings. “My child wants to go, but I don’t know what kind of event it will be. I am worried that the bus going home will be really packed,” she said. Hiromichi Miyazawa, who teaches at a public elementary school in Higashimurayama, said, “The city has yet to tell schools about safety measures, so I cannot assume responsibility as a teacher who has the children’s lives in my hands.” As a school activity, students in the higher grades at Miyazawa’s school visit Tama Zenshoen to learn about human rights issues by listening to people who have recovered from leprosy. But in the past year or so, the sanitarium has had to suspend such visits because of the pandemic. “We have canceled traveling classes, social studies field trips and excursions, keeping children from participating in many activities,” Miyazawa said. “How can we tell them that we’ll make an exception, just this once, for the Olympic torch event?” A city official insisted that COVID-19 preventive measures will be in place at the ceremony, such as asking attendees to wear masks, use hand sanitizers and have their body temperatures checked. “If many parents are worried and nobody wants to attend, then it is not an obligation for schools to select attendees,” the official said.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14369897

The estimate does not include visitors without tickets who may visit the area, which has been designed to provide an “Olympic experience” for all people. Seven competition venues are located within a 1.5-kilometer radius in the waterfront area of Koto Ward. Olympic organizers and government officials have yet to decide on whether the Summer Games will be staged with spectators during the continuing novel coronavirus pandemic. Overseas spectators have already been barred from attending. Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga wants audiences in the stands at the Games, according to officials with the Tokyo Olympic organizing committee. Health experts, however, said that if fans can attend the events, there should be a cap on their numbers for each venue. Government officials are expected to decide on the spectator issue by June 20, when the COVID-19 state of emergency is scheduled to be lifted for Tokyo and nine prefectures. Under the state of emergency, sports and other events have been held with spectators based on the rule that only 50 percent of the venue can be filled, and the number of people must not exceed 5,000. If a similar rule is used for the Summer Olympics, a maximum total of more than 3 million people are expected to attend the events, excluding the marathons and track and field competitions, according to the Asahi calculations. The crowd estimate was based on the competition schedule and the capacity of each venue published by the Tokyo Olympic organizing committee. Competitions will be held in the capital and nine other prefectures over 19 days. The calculations showed that up to 68,000 spectators will attend competition events at the seven venues in the waterfront area on July 25, the first Sunday after the Opening Ceremony on July 23. Overall, around 700,000 people are projected to show up at the seven venues during the Games through Aug. 8. However, many more are expected to visit the area, which the International Olympic Committee and other organizers named “Tokyo Waterfront City.” It was set up under the concept of fusing a city and sports and to give visitors without tickets an Olympic experience. An Olympic flame cauldron, separate from the one at the National Stadium, the main Olympic venue, will be placed on the Dream Bridge connecting the Ariake and Odaiba districts in the area. The area also features a recreational walking path of about 2 km, a zone for skateboarding and 3x3 basketball, which will make their debuts as Olympic sports in Tokyo, pavilions of official sponsors, and a large shop selling Olympic-related goods. Before the pandemic, the Odaiba Marine Park on the waterfront was visited by fewer than 10,000 people a day in July, according to park managers. Officials at the organizing committee and the Tokyo metropolitan government are working on measures to prevent congestion there during the Olympics. But their policy to open the area to the general public remains in place. Details of the measures are expected to be announced later. Tetsuya Matsumoto, a professor of infectious diseases at the International University of Health and Welfare, stressed the urgency of restricting crowd sizes at places where people will likely gather, saying spectators from all over Japan will come to Tokyo during the Games. “If spectators go straight home after watching the competitions, they will be less likely to impose risks in terms of transmitting the virus,” he said. “But the Olympic Games are, simply put, a ‘festival.’ They will tend to linger in the waterfront area if various events by official sponsors are staged. If other crowds join, the infection risk will heighten.” Shigeru Omi, chairman of the government’s expert panel responding to the pandemic, and his colleagues will soon issue a report on the assessment of the infection risks in Tokyo when the Olympics and Paralympics are held and measures to reduce the risks.

He announced the goal June 9 during his first one-on-one Diet debate with leaders of the opposition camp. It was the first to be held in two years. The debate centered on steps the government is taking to bring the COVID-19 pandemic under control and whether Japan should press ahead with the Olympic Games scheduled to start in late July. Yukio Edano, leader of the main opposition Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan, pointed out that the current COVID-19 state of emergency was repeatedly extended due to a resurgence of infections. “It was too early to lift the previous emergency declaration in March,” Edano told Suga. “A fifth wave of infections must be prevented at all costs. You should present clear and strict criteria (for lifting the state of emergency).” Suga responded that progress in the vaccination program holds the key to controlling infections, noting that nearly 20 million doses had been administered already. “I want to finish inoculating all those who need or want to be vaccinated by October or November,” he said. With regard to the Olympics, Suga vowed that the government will take all possible steps to prevent a spread of infections by capping the number of athletes and staff who attend and monitoring the movements of the foreign media using GPS devices. “I want to show that the world can overcome the coronavirus by fighting as one,” he said, renewing his resolve to stage the sports extravaganza, already delayed by one year due to the pandemic. However, Suga rejected opposition parties’ demands for a supplementary budget to fund anti-virus measures and an extension of the ordinary session of the Diet that ends June 16. In response, the CDP, the Japanese Communist Party, the Democratic Party for the People and the Social Democratic Party began preparing to submit a no-confidence motion against the Suga Cabinet.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14369771

1,Tokyo police and firefighters get jabs at ex-Tsukiji fish market site,['By MOMOKO IKEGAMI/ Staff Writer'],"June 9, 2021 at 18:36 JST"," The Tokyo metropolitan government on June 8 started mass vaccinations for police officers and firefighters at the former Tsukiji fish market site in the capital’s Chuo Ward. The metropolitan government plans to open similar mass vaccination sites in five other locations, hoping to inoculate every Tokyo resident who wants to receive a shot by the end of the year. About 3,000 employees of the Metropolitan Police Department and the Tokyo Fire Department received a shot of COVID-19 vaccine on the first day. Their body temperatures were checked in a tent set up at the outdoor site and aft er physicians interviewed them about their health inside a prefabricated facility, they were guided to one of the 15 booths to get a shot administered by nurses. To secure enough health care workers to administer the vaccine, the metropolitan government enlisted nurses who have been off work due to child-rearing and other reasons, as well as dentists who have been trained to administer an intramuscular injection. The metropolitan government initially expected to administer the vaccine at the site to 52,000 MPD employees and 5,000 TFD employees, but it has expanded the eligibility to include members of fire companies, veterinarians, acupuncturists and judo therapists. Officials plan to administer the first of two shots for 5,000 people per day, and 110,000 people in total, at the Tsukiji site by June 30. Afterward, the site will be used as a base for vehicles that will transport athletes and officials during the Tokyo Olympics. For the second shot, the metropolitan government will use Yoyogi Park in Shibuya Ward. Officials hope to administer the vaccine to 5,000 people every day and up to 25,000 people per day at the five sites that will be newly established for mass vaccinations, which include one in the western Tama area, they said. In addition to the metropolitan government, multiple organizations--city and ward offices, the Self-Defense Forces and large-scale companies--are running a mass vaccination program in Tokyo. Each program has different eligibility rules for people to receive the vaccine such as occupation and age. A metropolitan government official said it is crucial “not to cause confusion” among residents and regarding who gets the vaccine first, “the order of priority has to be convincing to many people.”",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14368968

1,Companies rush to set up in-house vaccination programs,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"June 9, 2021 at 16:47 JST"," Companies across Japan rushed to apply to set up vaccination programs for employees at their workplaces after the government gave the green light June 8 for them to do so. But many others wavered as they considered the practicalities of what would be involved. Applications were submitted by companies and universities for approval to set up more than 500 sites at workplaces and campuses. The program is scheduled to begin June 21. Many companies are concerned about whether they can secure enough medical staff for the vaccinations and if it is OK to inoculate their employees ahead of elderly local residents. Companies and universities can apply for the workplace vaccination program after they decide the procedures and rules to provide inoculations. The government anticipates this will be done in three ways: vaccinating at clinics within companies; asking medical personnel to visit and provide vaccinations; and sending employees to medical institutions. Companies and universities will receive vaccines, syringes and equipment to store the vials at low temperatures to start giving inoculations as early as June 21. East Japan Railway Co. was one of the companies that applied for the program on June 8. “To operate our railway services in a stable manner, it is essential that we start the vaccination rollout as early as possible,” Yuji Fukasawa, the president of JR East, said at a news conference. The company said it will implement the program at two facilities in Tokyo and Sendai. It plans to finish the vaccination rollout this year for 22,000 employees, such as station staff, signal operators and maintenance workers. Softbank Corp. also applied to vaccinate about 100,000 people, including employees, their family members and mobile phone sales agents. The mobile carrier giant said that it had already secured the services of 40 or so doctors and nurses. Rakuten Group Inc., Nomura Holdings Inc., BicCamera Inc., Iris Ohyama Inc. and Sompo Japan Insurance Inc. were among other large companies that applied for the workplace vaccination program the same day. Sompo Japan said it had not yet determined the priority order for its employees. “This is a race against the clock, so we should think about it while we are running,” said Kengo Sakurada, the president of the parent company Sompo Holdings Inc. Many companies did not apply for the program, however. Toyota Motor Corp., Honda Motor Co. and Nissan Motor Co., are planning to follow suit but did not apply on June 8. “There are too many things to decide, so we failed to apply in time,” said a representative of a large corporation.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14368937
1,Student to sue university for only offering online courses,['By YURI MURAKAMI/ Staff Writer'],"June 9, 2021 at 16:10 JST"," Fed up with only being offered online courses due to the novel coronavirus pandemic, a university student is planning to sue the institution for the return of school fees. The student, who is 19, accused Meisei University of not fulfilling its obligation to offer face-to-face learning opportunities for more than a year. He entered the university in Hino, western Tokyo, in April 2020 to study business administration to equip him with the skills to run his own company in the future. His first disappointment came when the university canceled its entrance ceremony to welcome new students. The next blow came when the department of business administration decided to offer only online courses for all of fiscal 2020. In most cases, students were asked to watch a lecture video that had been recorded beforehand and submit a report. “I saw professors only through a computer screen,” he said. “There was no opportunity to make friends to talk to and ask questions from the classes. I felt lonely.” He contends the university did not adequately explain its decision to continue online courses, and said that created a sense of distrust. Frustrated by the situation, he decided to sue the university. His 70-year-old father encouraged him to pursue the matter if the university continued to handle the matter in an irrational way, he said. In prepared legal documents, the student pointed out that the education ministry in July and September 2020 asked universities to explain being unable to offer face-to-face instruction and urged them to set up opportunities for students and professors to mingle. But Meisei University acted “against the ministry’s request” and failed to fulfill its contractual obligation to let students use its facilities, he argued. He is expected to demand 1.4 million yen ($12,800) in compensation, which includes part of the tuition. “Many students are concerned and questioning the university's decision to continue online courses without giving the issue careful consideration,” he said. “Somebody needs to say something about it.” A university representative said that all departments had offered only courses online since spring last year. Starting from last fall, some courses returned to a face-to-face format, but the business administration department stuck to online courses throughout the last fiscal year. The guidelines were posted on the portal website for students and the university’s website, the representative said. Freshman in the business administration department had two opportunities, September 2020 and March this year, to mingle with each other, as well as senior students and professors, the representative said. The representative declined to comment on the student’s plan to file a lawsuit. A survey by the education ministry found that as of last October, 187 schools including universities and polytechnics said face-to-face courses constituted less than half of the all those offered. Eighteen of those schools said that “Almost all of the students understood and accepted the formats of courses.”",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14368916

1,Top Japanese virologist warns of risks of Tokyo Games during pandemic--paper,['REUTERS'],"June 8, 2021 at 14:51 JST"," A top Japanese virologist and government adviser has warned of the risks of spreading COVID-19 infections during the Tokyo Olympics, the Times of London reported on Tuesday, the latest high-profile caveat about the global sporting showpiece. Tohoku University professor Hiroshi Oshitani was an architect of Japan’s “Three Cs” approach to the pandemic, which advises avoiding closed spaces, crowds and close contact situations. “The government and the organizing committee, including the IOC (International Olympic Committee), keep saying they’re holding a safe Olympics. But everybody knows there is a risk. It’s 100 per cent impossible to have an Olympics with zero risk... of the spread of infection in Japan and also in other countries after the Olympics,” the Times quoted Oshitani as telling the newspaper. “There are a number of countries that do not have many cases, and a number that don’t have any variants. We should not make the Olympics (an occasion) to spread the virus to these countries,” he added, noting most countries lack vaccines. Already postponed from last year because of the pandemic, a scaled-down version of the Games with no foreign spectators is set to start on July 23 despite public fears the event could spread the coronavirus and drain medical resources. Japan has not suffered the explosive outbreak seen elsewhere but has recorded nearly 760,000 cases and more than 13,500 deaths. Tokyo and other regions are under a state of emergency after a fourth wave hit, straining hospitals. The government’s top medical adviser, Shigeru Omi, said last week medical experts planned a statement on the Games by June 20, when the state of emergency is set to be lifted. A labor union in the northern island of Hokkaido, where the Olympic marathon will be held, petitioned its governor on Monday calling for the Games to be cancelled, media said. Japanese Olympic Committee board member Kaori Yamaguchi, a judo bronze medalist at the 1988 Games, said on Friday Japan had been “cornered” into pressing ahead with the Games. Japan’s public remains divided about holding the Games, although opposition appears to be easing somewhat. A poll by broadcaster TBS this week showed 55 percent wanted the Games either postponed or cancelled--down 10 points from last month.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14368034

0,Virus variants causing surge in COVID-19 cases among children,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"June 7, 2021 at 18:20 JST"," More transmissible COVID-19 variants have led to a rapid rise in infections among an age group previously seen as the least susceptible to the novel coronavirus, health experts said. People under 20 years old now account for about 10 percent of all COVID-19 patients in Japan. The health experts are making fresh calls for families to step up protection of their children and to monitor them for signs of severe symptoms that could develop weeks after they become infected. Outbreaks have been reported at schools and child care facilities across the nation, affecting many children. One example was a cluster infection that hit a preschool in Niigata Prefecture in February. Thirteen children and four workers were infected by a variant. The virus eventually spread to family members, raising the total of infections to 42. The case underscores the variants’ ability to spread more easily than the initial coronavirus that was prevalent last year, according to Akihiko Saito, professor of pediatrics at Niigata University who is tasked with compiling anti-coronavirus measures for the Japan Pediatric Society. Health ministry statistics showed that patients under 20 numbered 78,952 as of June 2, accounting for about 10.7 percent of the 737,086 overall COVID-19 patients in Japan. The figure for the under-20 age group has grown by about 2.2 times since Feb. 3, when the country was in the grip of variants that were fast replacing the original type of the coronavirus. In contrast, the number of patients who are 20 or older has increased by about 1.9 times since Feb. 3. Saito said the disparity in the growth of cases between the two age groups does not necessarily mean that children are more vulnerable to variants. “As variants are more transmissible, they push up the number of overall infections, including children,” he said. The common route of infection among children has been through family members. But the sharp rise in infected children indicates that more younger people bear the brunt of household infections driven by variants, according to the experts. Most infected children generally develop mild symptoms. In some extremely rare cases, children slip into serious condition weeks after getting infected. One major concern in Japan has been the multiple reports of children developing multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C), in which patients’ heart or liver functions deteriorate, or they suffer from digestive symptoms, such as diarrhea and stomachaches. The Japanese Society of Kawasaki Disease also said it has confirmed four severe cases of MIS-C among children who were infected with the novel coronavirus. In one case, a teenage boy was hospitalized with a high fever and diarrhea about two months after a family member transmitted the virus to him. The boy suffered from large lymph nodes in the neck, a rash, and red eyes and lips, which are also symptoms of Kawasaki Disease. The causes of the disease, which usually affects children under 5 years old, are unknown. The teenager was hospitalized for about four weeks and has since recovered. He has not complained of any aftereffects, according to the Japanese Society of Kawasaki Disease. In the United States, more than 3.85 million children had been infected by the novel coronavirus by May 6. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported about 3,700 MIS-C cases, including 35 deaths, as of May 3. Mamoru Ayusawa, associate professor of pediatrics at Nihon University and vice chairman of the Japanese Society of Kawasaki Disease, urged parents to closely monitor their children for symptoms, referring to a possible rise in MIS-C cases in Japan amid the continuing pandemic. “(Parents) should pay attention especially to symptoms of children’s digestive organs, chest pain and complexion over a couple of months after they are infected with the coronavirus,” he said. “If children show such symptoms, they should see a doctor at a hospital with a large pediatrics department.”",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14367428
1,Chiba governor: No good reason to let spectators attend Olympics,['By YOSHIHIRO SAKAI/ Staff Writer'],"June 7, 2021 at 16:45 JST"," Chiba Governor Toshihito Kumagai on June 6 insisted that the Tokyo Olympics be held without spectators, arguing that there are more important things, such as public health, than watching sports live. “If the Games are hosted with spectators, the risks of creating a huge flow of people will be the highest,” Kumagai said on his blog. “The Olympics may be a once-in-a-lifetime event, but they are just sports events after all.” Chiba Prefecture, located just east of the capital, is scheduled to host events in four Olympic sports: fencing, taekwondo and wrestling in Chiba city, and surfing in Ichinomiya town. Olympic organizers have already decided that spectators from overseas will be banned from attending the Olympics as a measure against the spread of the novel coronavirus, but they have not yet decided on whether to allow any people into the stands. In what is believed to be his first public opinion on the issue, Kumagai, who took office in April, said on his blog that if spectators are allowed, he “will not be able to ask residents to refrain from crossing prefectural borders and to avoid nonessential outings during the Summer Games.” He asked the central government and Olympic organizing officials to explicitly recognize this point. The governor also compared watching the Olympics with visiting hometowns to see family members for the first time in a year or traveling with a growing 5-year-old child. “Those cases cannot be considered less essential than going to watch the Games,” he wrote. Kumagai also commented on the government’s comparison of the Olympics with professional baseball games that now allow a limited number of spectators in the stands. “We should not think of an event held by private companies and an event hosted by governments in the same way,” he said. “There are no important life-sustaining reasons for the Games to be held with spectators.”",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14367402
1,Second Olympic viewing event at Tokyo park faces call for scrapping,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"June 7, 2021 at 15:05 JST"," Musashino city officials are asking that a s cheduled public viewing event in Inokashira Park for the Tokyo Olympics be called off to prevent the spread of novel coronavirus infections. Neighboring Mitaka city, which co-hosts the park with Musashino, has not called for its cancellation but is asking that stronger anti-virus measures be taken for the event. The Musashino city government on June 4 submitted a request for the Tokyo metropolitan government to call off the public event at the park, which straddles both cities. On the same day, Mitaka city government also asked the metropolitan government to take tougher anti-virus measures for the event and share information on what those will be. The requests follow the Tokyo metropolitan government's decision on June 1 to cancel plans to use Yoyogi Park in Shibuya Ward for a public viewing event during the Olympics. Instead it plans to set up a mass vaccination center there. At the public viewing sites, Olympic partner corporations plan to set up booths and visitors can try their hand at some of the events. The Inokashira Park event venue is expected to have a capacity to host 20,000 visitors. In Hachioji, also in western Tokyo, another Olympic viewing event is scheduled in the Minami-Osawa Campus auditorium of Tokyo Metropolitan University. According to the university, the auditorium can accommodate about 1,000 people. However, the university's labor union is calling for scrapping the event due to its concerns over holding it during the COVID-19 pandemic. It is asking the university to refuse to let the Tokyo metropolitan government use the auditorium. In a statement, the union said, “As the metropolitan government is asking the university to hold online classes and cancel students’ extracurricular activities, it is simultaneously calling for cooperation for the public viewing event, which will attract an unknown number of spectators.

1,Squid statue paid for with COVID-19 funds inks following in Noto,['By HIROYUKI KOJIMA/ Staff Writer'],"June 6, 2021 at 07:10 JST"," NOTO, Ishikawa Prefecture--A giant squid statue here funded by a central government subsidy to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic is no longer being derided as a colossal waste of taxpayers' money by all. Instead, to people like squid lover Nameko Shinsan, who sometimes eats the popular seafood three times a day, the statue ""looks as if it is swimming right there and has a life force."" The squid’s mouth is a hole where visitors can poke their head through. “For squid lovers, sticking your head out of the mouth is like a dream come true,” Shinsan said. Visitors take a picture of a giant squid statue in Noto, Ishikawa Prefecture, on April 9. (Hiroyuki Kojima) The squid is a super life-like statue, 13 meters in length and four meters in height. It weighs about five tons. The squid has goggling eyes and its legs stretch out long and far as if it is dancing and moving. The statue, made of fiber-reinforced plastic, was installed on the side of a prefectural road that runs along Tsukumo Bay, a popular spot for sightseeing and pleasure boats, in late March. It is in the town of Noto, located near the tip of the Noto Peninsula, more than two hours by car from the prefectural capital, Kanazawa. The town’s Ogi Port is a leading port for the catch of surumeika, a type of squid. Town officials said the statue’s concept is dog-eat-dog, or ""squid-eat-squid."" The town last year came up with a plan to build the statue near a facility that has a shop, restaurant, tourist information center and exhibition corner featuring the squid, hoping to boost its post-pandemic tourism economy. According to town officials, 25 million yen ($229,400), or 90 percent of the construction costs, were paid for with COVID-19 relief funds from the central government. The town shouldered the rest of the costs, about 2 million yen. There have been reports around the country that local governments spent the funds, called a local recreation emergency grant, on offbeat items such as “a bell to eliminate discrimination against COVID-19” and “illumination in front of a train station.” LOCAL ATTRACTION DESPITE NEGATIVE COVERAGE As soon as the Noto town officials announced its plan to install a giant squid with the COVID-19 money, they were swept up in a flood of criticism from far and wide. Foreign news media, including the BBC and The New York Times, reported on the controversy. A town official said in frustration, “News media reported it as if we spent all of the COVID-19 relief funds on the squid.” However, the squid has been a sleeper hit with many locals and visitors. A giant squid statue installed in front of Tsukumo Bay in Noto, Ishikawa Prefecture, on April 9 (Hiroyuki Kojima) On a weekday in April, families and couples surrounded the statue to take a picture with it. A man in his 40s, who lives in Kanazawa and works in the construction industry, said he came to the town for work. When he was driving along the prefectural road, he was so surprised to see the giant squid that he had to pull over to take a look. “The complexion looks very authentic. It has a strong impact,” he said. The town government called for a nickname for the squid and received 909 suggestions, officials said. Town officials see no problem with spending the relief money on the statue. The central government listed examples for the use of the fund, which include projects that “polish up local attractions” and “promote local specialties.” The town officials said the statue falls under these two categories. In fiscal 2020, the town received COVID-19 relief funds totaling 680 million yen. Much of the money was spent on a project to provide a terminal device to every student attending the town’s elementary and junior high schools for online classes, as well as for issuing shopping vouchers to boost the local economy. NOT ALL ON BOARD WITH EXPENDITURE Hideki Noboru, a professor on local autonomy at Meijo University, said the spending on the squid was not an appropriate use of the funds. He said the central government allowed local governments wide discretion in spending the money, which spurred local governments to go overboard on projects that are not closely related to COVID-19 measures. “I think it is fraud committed against the people,” Noboru said. A man in his 60s who lives in Noto said the squid “may bring in tourists, but the money should have been spent on support for health care organizations that have worked hard on the front lines of the pandemic.” A giant squid statue lit up at night on April 9 in Noto, Ishikawa Prefecture (Hiroyuki Kojima) Despite the criticism, the squid has established itself as a new local attraction. It is lit up at night, drawing even more attention. A woman in her 70s who lives near the statue has welcomed her new shiny neighbor. She said many households in the community are elderly people and the local sentiment tends to be negative. “But the light of the squid has brightened the mood of our community,” she said. Shinsan said she becomes hungry just by seeing a picture of the statue. She believes the statue actually will achieve a purpose of the fund by making the local specialty well known around the nation. “I have eaten squid in Saga Prefecture but never in Noto,” she said. Once the pandemic has ended, she wants to fulfill her dream of sticking her head out of the squid’s mouth.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14354438

The center announced it will limit the number of outpatients and inpatients it accepts per day until June 20, when the central government’s state of emergency is due to end. The center said it will give priority to those who require emergency care when accepting inpatients. Okinawa Chubu Hospital in Uruma also began restricting outpatient services and hospitalizations on June 2. Ishigaki issued its own state of emergency on May 31. The Okinawa Prefectural Yaeyama Hospital on the remote island of Ishigakijima in the city has suspended general outpatient services in the afternoon for the time being since June 1, citing the need to free up its capacity to treat severe COVID-19 patients. Okinawa Miyako Hospital, on another remote island of Miyakojima, pushed back the dates for conducting nonurgent surgeries and examinations. A spike in COVID-19 cases in the prefecture is also straining the operations of local public health centers. The prefectural government decided to no longer require health care centers in the central southern part of Okinawa’s main island to identify people coming into close contact with infected individuals if the patients are at low risk of becoming seriously ill. Instead, the health care centers will ask the patients to inform people they have had close contact with of their infections on their own, according to the prefectural government. “A surge in infections is putting a severe strain on health officials tasked with identifying (people coming into close contact with infected individuals),” a prefectural government official said. ""We will prioritize the cases that are most in need.”",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14364656

Ambassadors from the EU's 27 countries approved the addition of Japan at a meeting on Wednesday, with the change to take effect in the coming days. EU countries are recommended gradually to lift travel restrictions for the current seven countries on the list - Australia, Israel, New Zealand, Rwanda, Singapore, South Korea and Thailand. Individual EU countries can still opt to demand a negative COVID-19 test or a period of quarantine. The EU last month eased criteria for adding new countries to the list, by changing to 75 from 25 the maximum number of new COVID-19 cases per 100,000 people in the previous 14 days. Britain met that revised target but was left off the list because of an increase in COVID-19 cases arising from an infectious coronavirus variant first identified in India. Britain recorded no COVID-19 deaths on Tuesday, for the first time since March 2020, but cases of the Indian variant doubled last week and the government has said it is too early to say whether Britain can fully drop restrictions on June 21. EU diplomats said Britain could be added to the list, depending on the course of the variant, in mid-June, when a larger group of countries are expected to be considered. The list is designed to eliminate inconsistency of travel restrictions across the bloc. France and Germany have imposed quarantines on UK visitors and Austria banned British tourists, while Portugal and Spain now welcome them. Meanwhile, Britain advises against travel to all EU countries except Portugal and only exempts people coming from Portugal from a requirement to quarantine.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14364317

0,OLYMPICS/ Host city to vaccinate staff helping athletes before seniors,['By HISAO NAGATA/ Staff Writer'],"June 2, 2021 at 19:21 JST"," OTA, Gunma Prefecture--A city that is hosting the Australian women's softball team prior to the Tokyo Olympics will use vaccines secured for senior citizens to inoculate Japanese staff who are taking care of the athletes. Officials here said the Cabinet Secretariat on June 1 accepted the city’s request to prioritize the vaccinations of city and hotel employees who are helping the Australian team. The city government made the request on the evening of May 31, asking “Please allow us to vaccinate Japanese staff in order to host a safe Olympics.” “It is not good that they hold practices fearing if they contract the virus from each other. But if the Japanese side are vaccinated, it will lead to safety and security,” Ota Mayor Masayoshi Shimizu said at a news conference on May 31. But a city official did not deny uneasiness in the decision, citing that the city, in fact, received complaints and angry calls from about 100 residents after the early vaccination of 300 people last month. “If we give the Olympics special treatment and let the (staff) jump the line, we will likely be swamped with complaints,” the official said. Asked by a reporter if such decision would provoke a backlash from residents, the mayor said, “I don’t think it is that much of a sin.” “And we don’t have such a petty person in Ota,” he added. Ota is hosting a pre-Olympic training camp for the Australian softball team, who arrived in the city on June 1. The team is expected to stay until July 17, practice and play games against Japanese teams, before the Olympics open on July 23. All 33 members of the team have been vaccinated before departing from Australia. They will take a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test every day during their 47-day stay in the city. City and hotel employees who take care of the team will be required to take a daily PCR test, while Japanese players and umpires involved in practice games are expected to take a test by the day before a game. But none on the Japanese side has received a vaccination. Since the team stays in a ""bubble"" and is only allowed to move between the hotel and a baseball park where they practice, city employees take care of many daily chores for the team, such as shopping. They are also tasked to prepare the practice facility including groundkeeping duties and keeping close tabs from the stands. According to the city, 13 city employees and 40 or so hotel employees who come into close contact with the athletes are expected to receive two Pfizer shots, originally secured through the central government to vaccinate elderly residents of Ota. Shimizu told reporters that such preferential treatment would not deprive senior citizens of being inoculated. “Seniors in Ota have received a Moderna vaccine at a mass vaccination center set up by the prefectural government, too,” Shimizu said. Therefore, the mayor said, “Inevitably, we will have vaccines to spare.” But the reality may not be so rosy. According to the city’s estimate, the city has secured enough Pfizer vaccines to inoculate about 54,200 people, 90 percent of the city’s elderly population, by the week starting June 21. The city has received a postcard reply from more than 80 percent of the elderly population who said they want to be vaccinated. The ratio of people who are willing to receive a vaccine was much higher than the city’s estimate, which was 70 percent. A prefectural Tomo vaccination center was set up in the city on May 24. By May 30, 300 elderly residents went in first ahead of 60,000 others and received a shot. It accounted for only 0.5 percent of the entire elderly population of the city. More vaccines are scheduled to be delivered to the city in July, which are intended for residents younger than 65. “If there is a shortage of vaccines, we can divert these vaccines,” said a city official who handles the vaccination project. “But we could well be criticized by residents who wonder, ‘Why do we have to go to such lengths for the Olympics?’” the official added.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14363904

Only Princess Yuriko, 97, the widow of Prince Mikasa, has not received the vaccination yet. Unlike members of the general public, imperial family members do not register their addresses with municipal governments, and as such they would not receive vaccination vouchers from them.

The Osaka prefectural government attributed the increase to the spread of the British variant and other mutated strains of the virus. Osaka Prefecture confirmed 213 new infections on June 2. That brought its total number of cases recorded since January 2020, when the first infection was reported in Japan, to 100,199, according to a tally by The Asahi Shimbun. The central government applied pre-emergency measures for Osaka, Hyogo and Miyagi prefectures from April 5 following a spike in infections there. But the number of new cases began exceeding 1,000 every day in Osaka Prefecture since mid-April, prompting the central government to issue a state of emergency for the prefecture on April 25. “The pre-emergency measures helped reduce the flow of people but failed to curb the number of new infections,” an Osaka prefectural government official said. “Both the movement of people and infection cases dropped sharply after the state of emergency was declared.” Osaka Prefecture logged 1,814 cases during the first wave of infections, which hit the country between Jan. 29 and June 13 last year. The prefecture reported 9,307 cases during the second wave between June 14 and Oct. 9 and 36,067 during the third wave between Oct. 10 and Feb. 28. As of June 2, Osaka Prefecture confirmed 53,011 infections during the current fourth wave, which started on March 1. The figure for the past three months accounted for 53 percent of the total number of cases reported in the prefecture. The cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in Tokyo has already surpassed 100,000 and reached 161,426 as of June 1. The capital on June 2 confirmed 487 new novel coronavirus infections, down 256 from a week earlier, as well as 13 deaths from COVID-19.

The park in Tokyo’s Shibuya Ward will be used to vaccinate employees of the Metropolitan Police Department and Fire Department starting on June 8. The metropolitan government’s plan to set up public viewing event sites for the Games has drawn fire over concerns that such crowded venues could hasten the spread of novel coronavirus infections at a time most of the Japanese population has yet to be vaccinated. The metropolitan government last month announced plans to inoculate police officers and firefighters at the former site of the Tsukiji fish market in Chuo Ward from June 8. But the Tsukiji site can be used for such vaccinations only until the end of this month because it is scheduled to be turned into a depot for vehicles associated with the Summer Games, which open on July 23. The metropolitan government decided to continue rolling out vaccines for police and firefighters at Yoyogi Park. The site will still be used for a public viewing event during the Paralympics, which begin on Aug. 24, as was planned. Public viewing events for the Olympics will be held at sites in Inokashira Park straddling Musashino and Mitaka on the outskirts of Tokyo and the square in front of Chofu Station, along with similar sites in Iwate, Miyagi, Fukushima and Kumamoto prefectures.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14363800

Shigeru Omi said at the Lower House Committee of Health, Labor and Welfare on June 2 that staging the Summer Games amid a major health crisis would be ruled out under normal circumstances. “But if organizers were to hold the Olympics (amid the pandemic), it would be their responsibility to minimize the scope of the event and strengthen health management,” he said. Omi, an expert on contagious diseases, was pressing for an Olympics with no spectators, or at least a minimal number of spectators, to prevent many people from coming into close contact. The Summer Olympics are scheduled to open on July 23. He also said the public “will be less likely to cooperate with efforts to host the Games, as it is unclear why organizers are bothering to hold the event despite the public health crisis.” Omi indicated he and other panel members would share their concerns about the risks of the Olympics turning into a super-spreader event with the International Olympic Committee and Tokyo Olympic organizing committee but not with the central government. He said that is because the government alone cannot decide on the fate of the event. Omi has taken the position that it is not the job of health experts to decide whether the Summer Games should be held. But he has said many experts believe they have the responsibility to provide advice on how to lower the risks of infection and point out any areas where risks are high.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14363884

Both numbers had been trending downward after they increased in fiscal 2009 in the aftermath of the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy and the ensuing global financial crisis. In fiscal 2020, the number of people who applied for welfare benefits climbed 2.3 percent year on year to 228,081, while the number of households that started to receive them rose 2.1 percent to 202,856, the ministry said on June 2. The highest number of welfare benefit applications filed in the fiscal year came when Japan declared its first state of emergency in April 2020, with applications jumping 24.9 percent year on year. The monthly figures were lower year on year between May and August last year, but from September to March they were higher year on year. For those seven months, the number of applications filed continued rising. In March, they rose 8.6 percent year on year. April 2020 also marked the fiscal year's highest growth rate in the number of households that started to receive the assistance, a 14.9 percent increase.

Ishigaki logged a record 25 new COVID-19 cases on May 31. The number of new infections in the most recent week per 100,000 population was 209.84, far higher than that of the entire Okinawa Prefecture, which was 127.43. The spike prompted city officials to issue the emergency declaration on May 31, urging residents to stay home even if they have no symptoms. All schools have been shut down. Hotels have received cancellation requests. At the Okinawa Prefectural Yaeyama Hospital, 37 of 41 beds set aside exclusively for COVID-19 patients have been occupied. Three of the patients have developed severe symptoms. “The situation is very difficult,"" a prefectural official said. ""It has already started greatly impacting general practitioners.” The city’s state of emergency, which urges residents to stay home from June 1 to 15, is strictly voluntary and not enforceable under a law or an ordinance. Businesses in the city are also asked to reduce the number of employees working in offices and to implement thorough measures to prevent infections from spreading. Both prefectural and city education boards decided to close schools from June 2 to 13. About 5,000 students who attend city-run elementary and junior high schools, as well as 1,400 or so who attend prefectural schools, have been urged to refrain from going out. According to the city’s education board, students at the affected elementary and junior high schools have obtained study materials online. Those who do not have an internet connection at home have received paper versions. The prefectural education board on June 1 notified prefectural high schools and others to support online learning for students. Junichi Ebinuma, 42, who runs a cafe in Ishigaki, on June 1 asked customers to sit side by side to prevent infections and shortened business hours. The number of customers that day was less than usual but several tourists came by, he said. Ebinuma decided not to serve alcohol. After 8 p.m., the cafe only accepts to-go and delivery orders. “As a business, it is difficult. But I think it will be effective in (preventing infections from spreading),” he said. Citing the fact that several people around him have tested positive for the virus, Ebinuma showed understanding for the declaration of a state of emergency. A 62-year-old woman who runs a guest house in the city said she has been inundated with cancellation requests since the prefecture came under the central government’s state of emergency late last month. All bookings made until around June 20 when the state of emergency for the prefecture expires have been canceled, she said. To anyone inquiring about a room reservations at the guest house, the woman would reply, “You would not be admitted to a hospital now because the hospitals are full.” The city’s issuance of its own state of emergency “came too little too late,” she lamented. The Okinawa leg of the Tokyo Olympic torch relay passed through Ishigaki before the Golden Week national holidays in early May. She said authorities “should have tightened border controls before the long holidays.” “It is hard to see negative news on the internet and on TV. Small accommodations (like mine) will not survive if this continues,” she said. (This article was written by Maho Fukui and Takuya Miyano.)",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14363801
1,"Companies, universities can start COVID-19 shots on June 21",['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"June 2, 2021 at 15:00 JST"," The government is opening a third avenue for COVID-19 vaccinations—companies and universities—to accelerate and expand coverage against the novel coronavirus. Chief Cabinet Secretary Katsunobu Kato said at his June 1 news conference that companies and universities can start giving shots to employees and students and faculty on June 21 using the recently approved vaccine developed by Moderna Inc. of the United States. The vaccine developed jointly by U.S. pharmaceutical company Pfizer Inc. and German biocommerce company BioNTech has been used for senior citizens, but as of May 31 only about 14 percent of that age group had received even a single dose. Japan’s vaccine program started in February for health care workers. Inoculations have been conducted at medical facilities and government-designated venues. Vaccinations in the third avenue will be managed by the companies and universities themselves. Although major companies with clinics or medical personnel regularly stationed on their premises could start giving the jabs from June 21, smaller businesses may have to find other means to inoculate their employees. One option may be to have local chambers of commerce organize joint vaccination programs for small businesses. Kato indicated that each company can decide if family members of employees as well as those working for subcontracted companies will be included. A number of companies whose employees are in regular contact with the general public, such as airlines and railway operators, have indicated they were preparing to begin vaccinations on June 21. Kato said that those seeking jabs at companies and universities can do so even if they have not yet received vaccination tickets from their local governments. The government has signed a contract with Moderna to obtain enough vaccines for 25 million people. The government has also set a goal of giving all senior citizens the required two shots by the end of July. The new program will mean that vaccinations will also be provided to much younger age groups. Kato also said local governments can begin inoculating other residents once they determine that the goal of vaccinating their senior citizens is in reach. Local governments are being asked to prepare vaccination tickets for mailing to the general population from mid-June. Masakazu Tokura, the new chairman of the powerful Keidanren (Japan Business Federation), said at a June 1 news conference that his organization would cooperate fully with the government plan for vaccinations at companies. Although it is unclear how many companies can begin to administer the shots on June 21, a high-ranking official of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party said that spreading the availability of vaccinations would help in holding the Tokyo Olympics about a month later. Takashi Nakano, a pediatrics professor at Kawasaki Medical School who is also knowledgeable about vaccines, said inoculations at the workplace would help protect other people. Those receiving the jabs not only have a comparatively low risk of developing serious symptoms, but they are also in the age group at high risk of infecting others because their work may take them to various locations outside the company, he said. Nakano added that steps would be needed to deal with possible side effects after inoculating employees.

1,Monitoring of teleworkers raises concerns of Big Brother,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"June 2, 2021 at 08:00 JST"," A supervisor told a woman not to worry about the company’s new plans for teleworking employees. Using software, her employer would determine how long she worked from home and would log the names of every Word and Excel file she used. There would be records kept of the subjects on her emails and which websites she viewed, as well as how long she actually operated her computer. All that data would be shared among management. “This is not surveillance,” the supervisor explained. The woman left the company two months later. “Is working at home impossible without such a thorough staff monitoring system?” the woman said with a sigh. With more people working from home in the COVID-19 pandemic, employers are using increasingly advanced software to remotely check if staff are loafing on the job. Some companies say the software is used to prevent extreme overtime. But whatever the reason, employees have expressed concerns about excessive surveillance and rising stress levels because of the monitoring. UNSHARED DETAILS NOW SHARED The woman who quit her job had worked as an editor of websites and paper publications. In January this year, she and her colleagues were encouraged to work from home under the second COVID-19 state of emergency. According to the employer’s accounts, the monitoring software was intended to see whether proper amounts of work were assigned to each worker and if such tasks were being done efficiently. The company said it would use the objective numerical data to review workload allocations and improve productivity because there would be far fewer opportunities for staff members to meet their bosses in person. But the woman and her colleagues could not believe that explanation, and they thought the company “simply wants to ensure that teleworkers are not lying down on the job.” The woman said she already had no time to relax while on duty because of strict deadlines and constant communication with clients. Being monitored as a teleworker increased the mental pressure on her. A rumor circulated that “just opening a file to work on would not be regarded as part of the job if nothing is done on it for a certain period of time.” That rumor heightened fears among workers that their employer was watching their every move. The woman said she tried to show she was present in front of her PC by working on unimportant email after finishing another task. While at the office, she said she was assessed based on the quality of her written articles and other outcomes. But after she began teleworking, all unshared details, including websites she referred to for writing, were made clear to management. “The company cannot trust employees when they are not in the office unless everything is made visible,” the woman said. “The employer’s stance was horrific.” Although she loved the work, she quit the company by March, saying the monitoring left her with a bad aftertaste. Some monitoring systems randomly select images of the teleworking employees’ computer screens, and another system uses cameras to take videos of them working. A Persol Research and Consulting Co. study in March 2020 found that 40 percent of bosses fear at times that teleworkers “may not do their tasks.” The percentage is higher than that of teleworkers who think they “may be considered to be slacking off on the job.” LABOR-MANAGEMENT TALKS URGED The Labor Lawyers Association of Japan said in a statement about teleworking in February that it is “a problem that employers constantly monitor the progress of work of employees.” Lawyer Kazuya Takemura, who is knowledgeable about teleworking, said “surveillance using software is the same as supervisors’ always watching subordinates’ work beside them at the office.” “Management and labor unions should discuss and determine how far employees should be managed to prevent a psychological burden from being imposed on them,” Takemura said. Some employers say that if attendance-recording systems are embedded into employees’ computers to check when they log on and off, working times can be very closely controlled, and excessive overtime can be prevented. “Labor time management is different from surveillance,” Takemura said. “Good use of technologies should be made without going as far as to carry out excessive surveillance.” The government, which has promoted working from home during the health crisis, is preparing a foundation for a much wider use of teleworking mechanisms. Labor ministry guidelines revised in March said companies that highly evaluate employees who continue commuting to offices go against the promotion of remote working styles. The ministry also strongly demands measures to prevent people from working excessive hours outside their offices. But it is difficult to clearly separate labor time management from surveillance. “Required first of all is a condition where employees can work securely under the company’s proper control,” said a labor ministry official about work management via the internet. “Talks between labor and management to set rules are important.” One significant precaution suggested is creating an atmosphere where employees can voice objections if they find the surveillance extreme and uncomfortable.

1,Panel experts mull how to raise doubts about holding Olympics,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"June 1, 2021 at 18:57 JST"," Some members of a government expert panel assigned to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic oppose holding the Olympics if infections are skyrocketing in Tokyo, but they have been reluctant to publicly present such views. According to several panel members who spoke to The Asahi Shimbun, many on the 17-member committee feel it would be difficult to go ahead with the Summer Games if the COVID-19 situation in the capital was at the most serious stage 4, meaning an “explosive growth” of new infections. But the members are still considering how to express this opinion, citing the huge social impact such an announcement would have. Panel members also said they were uncertain about how to state their views because the Tokyo Olympic organizing committee has its own panel of experts that is looking into how the event should be held. However, some government panel members feel they should make their opinions known before the organizing committee decides later this month on whether spectators will be allowed in the stands for the Olympics. If the Olympics are held, domestic travel to Tokyo would increase significantly, raising the risk of an explosion in new COVID-19 cases, they said. If Tokyo was at stage 4 during the Olympics, not only would new cases rise, but the health care system also would be strained, making it more difficult to provide ordinary medical care to the general public. Panel members also assessed what could happen if the Olympics were held while Tokyo was at stage 3, meaning a “sharp increase” in new infections. One assessment was that new cases would jump either during the Olympics or soon after the Closing Ceremony. It added that no spectators should be allowed into the stands and the overall scale of the event should be reduced in a stage 3 situation. Panel members also pointed out that Japan would have to bear the responsibility if the sporting extravaganza becomes a “superspreader” event that ends up contaminating populations overseas. “We want the government to present a detailed risk assessment for each stage of the infection spread,” one panel member said.

People who received vaccine shots will be exempted from the requirement, but they will need to show their vaccination certificates instead, according to the officials. However, some government officials and experts raised doubts about the achievability of implementing such a large-scale precautionary measure at this late date in addition to a possible public backlash. “There have not been official negative certificates issued (in Japan),” said an official handling the Olympic and Paralympic Games. “For instance, any document issued by hospitals where spectators are tested will be acceptable? How can you confirm them as authentic? It can cause many problems.” The government and the Tokyo Olympics organizing committee have already decided not to accept overseas spectators. All spectators will be prohibited from eating and drinking alcohol at the venues as well. The government and organizers are planning to decide whether the Games will be held with spectators in June as they monitor the infection trends and analyze the outlook for the state of emergency, which is currently in effect for Tokyo and nine prefectures. A government official said that Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga and his administration “are leaning toward hosting the Olympics with spectators.” If the government decides to hold it with spectators, it wants to improve the effectiveness of anti-virus measures by requiring the COVID-19 negative test certificates. When Suga was questioned at a May 28 news conference about the risk of the Olympics spreading infections further, he showed willingness to hold them with spectators, citing professional baseball games as an example that have fans in the stands. “It is true that they are being held with spectators as measures to prevent the virus from spreading are in place. We can make a similar response,” Suga said. (This article was written by Masahiro Iwao and Akiyoshi Abe.)",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14362919

The government is considering asking travelers arriving from Vietnam and Malaysia, which has also been hit by a surge in infections from virus variants, to stay at designated quarantine facilities for six days. The Vietnamese government described the hybrid of Indian and British variants as “much more transmissible when airborne than other variants.” “We would like to implement necessary measures flexibly and promptly to alleviate people’s anxiety,” Chief Cabinet Secretary Katsunobu Kato said at a news conference on May 31. Arrivals from India, Pakistan, Nepal, Bangladesh, Maldives and Sri Lanka are currently required to self-isolate at designated accommodation facilities for 10 days.

Tokyo and Osaka are covered by the relaxed restrictions, but differences have emerged between the two major urban centers. While national and other museums in the capital are reopening from June 1, four museums in Osaka will remain closed until the June 20 deadline for the end of the state of emergency. And for the Tokyo museums, reservations must be obtained beforehand through the internet as the number of entrants will be limited daily. In Tokyo, fans of cinemas and super “sento” bathhouses were lining up outside those establishments before their doors opened. At the Shinjuku Piccadilly cinema complex, a 59-year-old man living in Matsudo, Chiba Prefecture, came straight to the theater after getting off the night shift at his job as a security guard. “I was looking forward to it reopening for so long,” the man said. “There are so many movies I want to see, so I'll watch two today.” A 53-year-old female company employee living in Shinjuku Ward said, “Movies are indispensable for maintaining my health because they help me laugh and cry. I'm so relieved it's open again.” Most major cinema complexes had cooperated with government requests to cease operations from April 25. But even with the new relaxed restrictions, Tokyo cinema complexes will shut at 9 p.m. daily. Osaka movie theaters will remain closed on weekends. There were also people waiting for the Ryogokuyuya Edoyu public bathhouse to open in the capital’s Sumida Ward. The super sento previously operated from 11 a.m. until 9 a.m. the next day. In compliance with the April request, it had remained closed for more than a month. Even with the relaxed measures, it will only operate until 8 p.m. every day and remain closed on weekends. Bathhouse staff were busy cleaning the baths and disinfecting lockers from about two hours before opening. While there are 400 lockers at the bathhouse, only half will be in use to allow for proper social distancing among customers. Posters have been put up at various locations in the bathhouse calling on customers to bathe without conversing, and the facility has put out more bottles of disinfectant for people to use. A 41-year-old female company employee living in Edogawa Ward was in line to enter from before 11 a.m. “Even with the pandemic going on, I need to relax,” she said. She planned to use various different baths until the evening, she added. The relaxed measures in Tokyo also cover video game centers, pachinko parlors, gymnasiums and bowling alleys. Four zoos and aquariums in the capital, including the zoo at Ueno, will resume operations from June 4. All four have been closed since December. But the number of daily entrants will be limited and reservations are required. Universal Studios Japan in Osaka reopened from June 1, with business hours from 10 a.m. until 6 p.m. Only 5,000 customers will be allowed in daily and the theme park will remain closed on weekends. While Chiba Prefecture is not covered by the state of emergency, the two Disney-related theme parks in Urayasu will continue with operating hours between 10 a.m. and 7 p.m. and upper limits of 5,000 people will be allowed in daily until June 20. Establishments that serve alcohol are being asked to remain closed until June 20.

The marathon scheduled to be held Nov. 21 would have marked the 10th anniversary of the annual event and at least 20,000 entrants were expected. But organizers decided that staging a large-scale event would be risky at a time when the country, not just Kobe and Hyogo Prefecture, is struggling to contain the health crisis. Hyogo Prefecture is now under its third state of emergency as a fourth wave of infections has triggered a surge of new cases. The curbs are due to expire June 20. Last year’s Kobe Marathon was also canceled due to the pandemic. Organizers decided in March it would be OK to go ahead with the marathon and were preparing steps to ensure safety against the virus, such as expanding the area at the start line to reduce congestion based on guidance provided by the Japan Association of Athletics Federations. They also planned to secure more staff to guide runners, implement measures to monitor the temperature of the entrants and organize water stations along the route.

1,Governors call for tightened steps against Indian variant,['By HARUFUMI MORI/ Staff Writer'],"May 30, 2021 at 17:45 JST"," Prefectural governors across Japan made an impassioned plea to the government to enhance steps against a coronavirus variant from India and to help speed up the vaccine rollout. As an immediate step, they called for strengthened checks at airports to keep the virus from entering Japan. Their proposals were compiled at an online meeting of the association of governors held May 29 in response to the government’s announcement the day before that the state of emergency for Tokyo and eight other prefectures will be extended beyond May 31 until June 20. At the meeting attended by 43 governors, many expressed concerns about the Indian variant, which is deemed to be more contagious than a variant first detected in Britain. The variant from Britain is now the dominant strain spreading in Japan, which is in the grip of a fourth wave of infections. The strain was first detected in Japan late last year. In calling for more rigorous measures at airports, Tottori Governor Shinji Hirai said the government’s efforts to keep the virus from Britain at bay had failed miserably. Toshihito Kumagai, the governor of Chiba Prefecture where Narita Airport is located, also acknowledged that the virus has made inroads into Japan despite airport checks aimed at detecting incoming affected passengers. Twenty-nine cases of the Indian variant had been detected in Japan as of May 24, the health ministry said. Among other proposals, the governors called on the government to keep track of the whereabouts of new arrivals during the two-week period they are obliged to provide frequent updates on the state of their health. They also urged it to share information on suspected infection cases and for local governments to receive assistance in identifying variants at regional labs, just like central government-affiliated facilities. With regard to vaccines, the governors urged the government to swiftly provide information on the schedules of supplies in July and beyond, including how many doses will be provided and for which vaccine. They also suggested that essential workers, such as the police and staff at facilities for people with disabilities and childcare centers, to be vaccinated ahead of the general public. To date, the authorities have placed priority on inoculating health care workers and those aged 65 or older. A number of governors proposed that jabs be offered at company offices and universities to speed up inoculations of those aged 64 or younger. “The government needs to work on a program to allow people to get vaccinated at their office or university,” said Osaka Governor Hirofumi Yoshimura, noting that many large companies and universities are located in his prefecture.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14361541

0,Those with Olympic links able to bypass self-quarantine,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"May 29, 2021 at 18:50 JST"," More than 1,400 athletes, officials and other key personnel associated with the Olympic Games being staged in Tokyo from July were exempted from self-isolating after arriving in Japan. The special treatment since April is in stark contrast to strict government policy implemented after the novel coronavirus pandemic struck early last year. Foreign nationals, in principle, remain prohibited from entering Japan, now in the grip of a fourth wave of COVID-19 cases. And even Japanese nationals living overseas and spouses of permanent residents are only permitted to enter under special circumstances. In all cases, those individuals are required to self-quarantine for two weeks. The government admitted May 28 that it was giving preferential treatment to Olympic athletes, coaches, referees and executives connected with the sports events after Akira Nagatsuma, a member of the opposition Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan, raised the issue during a session of the Lower House Health, Labor and Welfare Committee. The government said that 1,649 foreign nationals connected with the Olympics had entered Japan since April, of whom 1,432 were exempted from the self-quarantine requirement. Those connected with the Olympics and Paralympics were exempted from the self-quarantine restriction as long as they repeatedly take polymerase chain reaction tests. Athletes are allowed, in principle, to take up training immediately after their arrival. Between April 1 and May 16, government officials said 1,649 individuals connected with the Olympics had arrived from 80 or so nations and regions. Of that number, 24 were from India, where a virulent mutant strain of the novel coronavirus is now making its presence felt in Japan. Of the 14 who arrived in May, all had shortened self-quarantine periods. Nagatsuma wanted to know why the principle of self-quarantine was waived for those connected with the Olympics. According to officials with the Cabinet Secretariat and Japan Sports Agency, included in the number of foreign arrivals are athletes who took part in pre-Olympic test events in track and field, diving and volleyball held in May. Others who arrived were individuals with the Olympic Broadcasting Services and technicians preparing for the upcoming Games. For such individuals, enforcing the self-quarantine requirement would have led to not meeting their work deadlines, officials said.

0,More people on Tokyo streets heralds uptick in COVID-19 cases,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"May 29, 2021 at 17:30 JST"," An analysis of pedestrian traffic in Tokyo suggests another uptick in COVID-19 cases may be just around the corner. The study by The Asahi Shimbun was based on the flow of human traffic aggregated by Tokyo-based Agoop Corp., a Softbank Group subsidiary that tracks people’s movements through GPS data on their mobile phones. The Asahi used data from Agoop compiled between April 1, 2020, and May 25, 2021, to calculate the average population per week around 14 rail hubs in the capital. Accepted wisdom to date suggests that if fewer people are on the streets, fresh cases of COVID-19 will show signs of dropping about two weeks later. One finding for the one-week period from April 28, following the declaration three days earlier of a third state of emergency, was that the flow of pedestrian traffic had fallen to 64 percent of the level of the previous week. The number of new COVID-19 cases for the week from May 12 was 90 percent of the level for the week from April 28, while the figure dropped to 73 percent for the week from May 19. However, the Agoop data points to a subsequent increase in the number of people going out. In comparison with the previous week, pedestrian traffic for the week from May 5 increased by 24 percent, while it had increased by 15 percent for the week from May 12. The figure remained unchanged for the week from May 19. While the number of new COVID-19 cases has been falling since the week from April 28, the latest figures indicate another uptick may be possible soon. “A key lesson we've learned so far is the need to maintain restraints on people's movement during the period when new infection cases start to decline so as to further reduce new cases,” noted Koji Wada, a professor of public health at the Otawara, Tochigi Prefecture-based International University of Health and Welfare. “But gaining the understanding of the public will not be possible unless data is presented about the number of vaccinations given and an exit strategy is also clearly presented.” A comparison of total human traffic flow for four-week periods found a 78-percent reduction between April 28 and May 25 compared with the immediate preceding four-week period between March 31 and April 27. But in comparison to the four-week period between April 29, 2020, and May 26, 2020, when the first state of emergency was declared, the figure for April 28 and May 25 represented a 64-percent increase.

Komeito surveyed 1,741 cities, wards, towns and villages through its prefectural chapters nationwide and released the results on May 26. It was conducted largely because a government survey on the COVID-19 inoculation program released on May 21 was vague and potentially misleading. According to that survey, 125 municipalities said it would be difficult to vaccinate all elderly residents by Suga’s targeted date. The government survey did not disclose which municipalities said they were unlikely to achieve the goal. A Komeito official said the party wanted to investigate why those municipalities were falling behind schedule and to help them improve the situation.

The ministry recommends that the vouchers be sent to residents in order of age or by area, instead of mailing them all at once, to avoid causing confusion when they make reservations to receive shots. Health care workers top the government’s vaccine priority list, followed by senior citizens aged 65 or older. People with underlying conditions, workers at facilities for elderly people and citizens aged between 60 and 64 are in the third priority group. People not in any of those categories will be vaccinated only after those in the priority groups receive jabs, in principle. But the ministry will allow municipalities to start inoculating residents with pre-existing conditions even before they finish vaccinating senior citizens. The ministry does not require people with underlying conditions to present medical certificates at an inoculation site to prove their eligibility. They only need to write their diseases on medical questionnaires they fill in before receiving a shot. Workers at facilities for elderly people are required to present certificates issued by the facilities, while staff at a vaccination site will check the eligibility of people in the 60-to-64 age group by referring to the date of birth entered on medical questionnaires.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14360221

1,109 manga artists sketch their daily lives amid COVID-19,['By SHOKO MIFUNE/ Staff Writer'],"May 28, 2021 at 07:00 JST"," The short anthology ""MANGA Day to Day"" is a collection of reflections by 109 manga artists on how the onset of the coronavirus pandemic quickly changed daily life as we know it. The artists collectively inked the first 100 days of the unremitting health crisis in Japan, beginning in April 2020. The cartoonists span genres and generations, including the likes of Tetsuya Chiba, famous for his boxing manga ""Ashita no Joe"" (Tomorrow's Joe), and Moyoco Anno, the creator of “Sugar Sugar Rune.” The project started after Kodansha Ltd. began publishing a similar series of stories and essays by 100 writers on its literary website in May last year. Ryoichi Suzuki, 39, an editor in charge of manga comic magazines at the company, was inspired by the project and decided it could also work well as manga. ""With the coronavirus pandemic still ongoing, it seems like we've been getting used to the situation in recent months,"" Suzuki said. ""When you read these books, I think you can remember the sense of tension we had earlier."" The editor used his personal connections to call on cartoonists to contribute, which resulted in 109 manga artists, including some working in duos, putting their pens to paper. Each artist took turns to create a manga strip taking place over the course of a day from April 1 to July 9, 2020. Their works began being published on Twitter on June 15, and the project generated a huge response. Chiba kicked off the project with the first strip for April 1, drawing the plague-fighting monster Amabie and expressing concerns over the way society has drastically changed in the pandemic. Kenshi Hirokane, known for his long-running ""Kosaku Shima"" series, drew a strip that features him anguishing over whether he should have his manga characters wear masks. In her panels, Kazumi Yamashita wonders how young people are coping with the pandemic when they cannot attend live concerts. Other artists explored a wide variety of techniques and styles to continue the run. While some portray how their characters are coping amid the pandemic, others shared a slice of their own day-to-day lives in essay format. The project ended on Sept. 22 on Twitter. The short works have been compiled into the two-part ""MANGA Day to Day"" anthology by Kodansha, which was released in March this year. Each part is being sold for 1,540 yen ($14). ‘WONDERFUL DAILY LIVES’ WILL RETURN In an interview with The Asahi Shimbun, Tetsuya Chiba, 82, talked about his experiences during the pandemic. Born in Tokyo in 1939, Chiba spent his early childhood in former Manchuria (present-day northeastern China). He is best known for boxing manga ""Ashita no Joe"" (""Tomorrow's Joe""), ""Notari Matsutaro,"" and many other works. Excerpts of the interview follow: Question: How has your life changed in the last year? Tetsuya Chiba: We manga artists can't work unless we hole up in our homes. Or rather, I can get more work done now. But it's a shame not to be able to visit places and meet people for my research. When I worked on the sumo manga ""Notari Matsutaro,"" I went to a sumo stable. As I watched the wrestlers in the training room, I could smell their sweat, the salt sprinkled on the ring and the blood from the abrasions they sustained when they were thrown into a roll. I can create vivid drawings only after I experience those things. Now, I do research on the internet and ask my son to go to places. But he takes photos with more details than I capture, so maybe I can draw better than before. Q: How do you feel now, with seemingly no end in sight to the pandemic? A: I hope we all think about new ways so that we can be a little smarter and become friendlier to the Earth. Nowadays, our values are fundamentally changing. I feel that the times are about to change in a big way. We are in a challenging time, but I have hope that when we come through it, our wonderful daily lives will be back, and I live every day looking forward to seeing it happen.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14350655
0,OLYMPICS/ Tokyo neighbor Chiba shuts out torch relay over virus concerns,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"May 27, 2021 at 18:48 JST"," Already rerouted and largely bereft of crowds because of resurging novel coronavirus infections, the much-hyped Tokyo Olympic torch relay will now have to bypass an entire prefecture located beside the host city. “In the best interests of local residents’ safety and security, I’ve made the decision to cancel the torch relay on all routes in the prefecture,” Chiba Governor Toshihito Kumagai said at a May 27 news conference. Local leaders and regional organizers have already restricted crowds and taken other anti-coronavirus measures for their legs of the 121-day Olympic torch relay that kicked off in Fukushima Prefecture on March 25. The torch was supposed to be carried in all prefectures in Japan before lighting the Olympic cauldron in Tokyo in July. In prefectures dealing with skyrocketing new COVID-19 cases--namely Osaka, Fukuoka, Hiroshima, Okayama, Hyogo and Kyoto--the routes for the torch runners were changed to avoid public roads. Residents have also been banned from ceremonial events concerning the torch relay. Many runners, including celebrities and star athletes, have withdrawn from the relay, citing the risk of spreading the novel coronavirus. Chiba is the second prefecture to entirely scrap the relay, following Fukuoka in Kyushu. Kumagai said he would inform Tokyo Olympic organizers about the prefecture’s decision by the end of the day. The relay was scheduled to start in the prefecture, which lies just east of the capital, on July 1 from Umihotaru, a rest area on the Tokyo Bay Aqua Line highway with a panoramic ocean view, in Kisarazu. A total of 258 people or groups were slated to participate in Chiba Prefecture’s route until July 3. Instead of the relay, Kumagai said, a torch lighting ceremony will be held behind closed doors on each of the three days. A parking lot of the Makuhari Messe exhibition and convention complex in the city of Chiba is being considered as a site for such a ceremony. The sprawling facility will be a venue for the Tokyo Olympics. “We are still in a situation where residents in the entire prefecture are urged to refrain from going out for nonessential purposes,” Kumagai said. “Letting torchbearers run will cause a movement of people in wide areas and likely further spread the virus.” In Ichinomiya, an oceanside town that will hold surfing competitions for the Summer Games, 14 runners were scheduled to carry the torch on the edge of the water for about 3 kilometers. A town official said the run was canceled because the prefectural government deems the “Swash zone” route a public road. “I get sad thinking about the torchbearers,” Ichinomiya Mayor Masaya Mabuchi said. “But we have no choice, considering the relay cannot be held on any public road.” The torch relay scheduled in Hokkaido on June 13 and 14 could also be canceled. After asking the central government to extend the COVID-19 state of emergency for the northern main island until June 20, Hokkaido Governor Naomichi Suzuki said on May 26, “It will be difficult to hold the relay on public roads once the state of emergency is extended.” A ceremonial event related to the relay is slated for Upopoy, the National Ainu Museum, in Shiraoi on June 13, as well as at Akapla, a square in Sapporo, on June 14. Both events will likely be held without public attendance, the Hokkaido government said. Toyama Prefecture is not under the state of emergency. But the prefecture in central Japan on May 23 logged a record number of new infection cases with 64. Alarmed by the surge, Toyama Governor Hachiro Nitta told reporters on May 26 that the torch relay scheduled for June 2 and 3 in the prefecture will not be held on public roads. Instead, a celebration event will be held each day, he said. “It was a tough decision. I am very sorry for not being able to fulfill the expectations of those who have looked forward to (the relay),” the governor said.

1,Japan steps up efforts to keep Indian variant out as cases rise,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"May 27, 2021 at 17:40 JST"," Some health experts fear that a coronavirus variant first detected in India and potentially more contagious than one that devastated Britain is slowly gaining a foothold in Japan. The government has been forced to ramp up efforts to keep the virus from India at bay through tightened quarantine measures at airports. It also is trying to slow its spread by early detection of those infected with widespread PCR tests that can detect the L452R mutation in the spike protein found in the India variant. The health ministry announced on May 26 that 29 people have been confirmed infected with the variant from India, known as B.1.617, in Japan as of May 24. Among these were six patients each in Chiba and Osaka prefectures, five patients each in Tokyo and Shizuoka Prefecture and four patients in Hyogo Prefecture. The number rose to 160 as of May 17 for people who tested positive during checks at airports. Tests conducted by the Tokyo metropolitan government showed that the India variant was detected in 14 people as of May 25. Of these, nine became infected after having close contact with people who had traveled overseas, indicating that preventing the virus’s inroad at airports has its limits. Tomoya Saito, head of the Center for Emergency Preparedness and Response for the National Institute of Infectious Diseases (NIID), said the variant may be more widespread than believed. “Given the ratio of positive cases found at airports, the India variant may have made inroads inside Japan in significantly larger numbers than the strain from Britain did” late last year, he said. What is also alarming are reports on cases of those who tested positive for the variant from India despite having not traveled overseas nor had contact with anyone infected. On May 14, the Tokyo Medical and Dental University announced that a patient at its hospital was confirmed with the variant from India. The infected patient is a man in his 40s with an underlying condition. He had no record of traveling abroad nor exposure to anyone infected with the virus from India. “The patient’s case can be interpreted that community infections with that particular variant are widening,” Hiroaki Takeuchi, an associate professor of virology at the university, said, adding that the confirmed cases so far may not necessarily reflect the extent of infections with the Indian strain of the virus in each region. Yoshihiro Takayama, a doctor at Okinawa Prefectural Chubu Hospital who leads the prefecture’s coronavirus response, fears the spread of the variant from India would exacerbate Japan’s battle against the virus. The variant from India is estimated to be more contagious than the strain that was first identified in Britain, a variant that is itself assessed around 30 percent more transmissible than the initial novel coronavirus by the NIID. “If the Indian version swept through the nation, it would be a lot more devastating to the country,” Takayama said. The southernmost prefecture has been placed under a state of emergency. It reported the nation’s highest new cases per 100,000 people over the most recent week on May 26, with 92.88. The prefecture has been pounded by variants that have a mutation known as N501Y, which is most notably seen in the British version, like elsewhere in Japan. In Britain, the Scientific Advisory Group of Emergency, an expert group, suggested in its report on May 13 that it is “a realistic possibly” that the India variant could be up to 50 percent more contagious than the Britain variant. Although Britain’s Public Health of England did not give specific numbers, it also suggested that the India variant is substantially more transmissible than the Britain variant. Scientists raised concerns about a possible drop in antibody levels created among people infected with the initial form of the coronavirus. They point to a possibility that protection provided by a vaccine that was developed based on the original virus could decline. But some studies showed that people who are fully inoculated with the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine are protected against the India virus as well. While the World Health Organization added the virus from India to the list of “variants of concern” to call for caution, the NIID also took a similar step by naming it one of the variants of concern. Variants from Britain, South Africa, Brazil and the Philippines are also on the list. The health ministry is set to conduct a large-scale surveillance by commissioning PCR tests to identify the variant from India to private-sector labs to detect patients and isolate them at an early stage.

1,Requests pour in for extension of COVID-19 state of emergency,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"May 27, 2021 at 13:58 JST"," Health experts have joined expanding calls from around Japan for Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga to extend the COVID-19 state of emergency beyond the May 31 deadline, saying medical systems remain severely strained. The central government plans to convene a task force meeting on May 28 to make a formal decision on whether to extend the state of emergency, which is currently in place for 10 prefectures A May 27 meeting of Cabinet ministers dealing with the pandemic will decide on the length of the extension. One likely scenario is to continue the emergency declaration until June 20, the deadline now for recently listed Okinawa Prefecture. That new deadline would come one month before the scheduled start of the Tokyo Olympics. On May 26, Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike held a video conference with her counterparts from the neighboring prefectures of Kanagawa, Saitama and Chiba and suggested the extension should be for a month or so. While Tokyo is under the state of emergency, quasi-emergency measures are in place for the three other prefectures. The four governors submitted a request with the central government for an extension of both measures. The governors of Osaka, Kyoto and Hyogo prefectures in the Kansai region, as well as the leaders of Hokkaido, Hiroshima and Okayama prefectures made a similar request for an extension on May 26. The three Kansai governors earlier in the day agreed to continue asking bars and restaurants to refrain from serving alcohol. Fukuoka Prefecture asked for an extension on May 25. Although Aichi Prefecture has not made a formal request to the central government, prefectural officials there also believe an extension is needed. The number of new COVID-19 cases in Tokyo and Osaka has been declining in recent weeks, but the medical care situation remains precarious. Tokyo is the only prefecture under the state of emergency where the hospital bed usage ratio is not at the most serious stage 4 level in excess of 50 percent. The strain on health care systems is one reason experts dealing with the pandemic are recommending that the state of emergency and other anti-virus measures should be kept in place. Health experts also pointed to the still high number of COVID-19 patients with serious symptoms as well as the number of fatalities. Japan had 1,050 patients with serious symptoms on May 1, but the figure had risen to 1,294 by May 24. Sixty-seven deaths from COVID-19 were reported on May 1. The number increased to 86 on May 24. The number of new cases per 100,000 residents over the most recent week has fallen to 32.09 in Tokyo and to 31.76 in Osaka. But in other localities, the number remains high. Hokkaido had a per capita figure of 79.5, while the number for Okinawa was 87.2. Eleven prefectures had numbers at the stage 4 level, leading experts on the government panel to say the health care situation was still very tight.

1,Limiting people’s movement key to holding ‘safe’ Olympics: study,['By HISATOSHI KABATA/ Staff Writer'],"May 25, 2021 at 19:12 JST"," Strict restrictions of movements of people in Tokyo for the Summer Olympics and Paralympics could reduce the spread of novel coronavirus infections to near the same level if the events were called off, researchers said. But a number of other factors must be in place for such a scenario to happen. The projection was made by Taisuke Nakata, an associate professor of public policy, and Daisuke Fujii, a project assistant professor of economics, both of whom are with the University of Tokyo. They said that crowding in the capital would cause far more new COVID-19 cases than the arrival of 100,000-plus people from overseas for the events. In addition to 15,000 athletes, 78,000 officials and workers are expected to arrive from abroad for the Summer Games from July 23 to Aug. 8 and Paralympics from Aug. 24 to Sept. 5. The study premised that 105,000 people would come from overseas, including journalists. Half of them would be vaccinated against virus, while 100 would enter Japan after testing negative at the time of their arrival. The research showed that if a new wave of infections emerged after the Olympic Games, the daily case numbers would peak in mid-October--if the current state of emergency for Tokyo is lifted in the middle of June and if 600,000 vaccine doses are administered daily across the nation. If the Games did not cause any additional increase in economic activity and people’s movements, the number of daily new COVID-19 cases would reach a peak of 842, according to the researchers. If the Olympic and Paralympic Games are called off, the study put the daily count of new cases at 822 in the middle of October. They said the key to stemming the spread of the novel coronavirus is to significantly curb movements of people by avoiding holding public-viewing gatherings and other events during the sports extravaganzas. If people’s movements increased by 2 percent and 6 percent, new daily infections at the peak time would reach 1,046 and 1,600, respectively. Crowds at these heightened levels have been recorded during the cherry blossom viewing season, according to the study.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14357743

1,Japan says U.S. travel warning for virus won’t hurt Olympians,['THE ASSOCIATED PRESS'],"May 25, 2021 at 16:54 JST"," The Japanese government Tuesday was quick to deny a U.S. warning for Americans to avoid traveling to Japan would have an impact on Olympians wanting to compete in the postponed Tokyo Games. U.S. officials cited a surge in coronavirus cases in Japan caused by virus variants that may even be risks to vaccinated people. They didn’t ban Americans from visiting Japan, but the warnings could affect insurance rates and whether Olympic athletes and other participants decide to join the Games that begin July 23. Most metro areas in Japan are under a state of emergency and expected to remain so through mid-June because of rising serious COVID-19 cases that are putting pressure on the country’s medical care systems. That raises concern about how the country could cope with the arrival of tens of thousands of Olympic participants if its hospitals remain stressed and little of its population is vaccinated. Japan’s Chief Cabinet Secretary Katsunobu Kato told a regular news conference Tuesday that the U.S. warning does not prohibit essential travel and Japan believes the U.S. support for Tokyo’s effort to hold the Olympics is unchanged. “We believe there is no change to the U.S. position supporting the Japanese government’s determination to achieve the Games,” Kato said, adding that Washington has told Tokyo the travel warning is not related to participation of the U.S. Olympic team. The United States Olympic & Paralympic Committee said it still anticipates American athletes will be able to safely compete at the Tokyo Games. Fans coming from abroad were banned from the Tokyo Olympics months ago, but athletes, families, sporting officials from around the world and other stakeholders still amount to a mass influx of international travelers. The Japanese public in opinion surveys have expressed opposition to holding the Games out of safety concerns while most people will not be vaccinated. The U.S. warning from the Atlanta-based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said: “Because of the current situation in Japan even fully vaccinated travelers may be at risk for getting and spreading COVID-19 variants and should avoid all travel to Japan.” The State Department’s warning was more blunt. “Do not travel to Japan due to COVID-19,” it said.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14357698

The official decision was made at the prefectural government’s task force meeting on May 25. Osaka Governor Hirofumi Yoshimura has been cautious about the lifting of the emergency declaration for his prefecture scheduled on May 31. The state of emergency for the prefecture was already extended on May 12. “We managed to curb the growth in infections, and (new cases) are now on the decline,” Yoshimura said at the meeting. “But the health care system is still under severe strain.” He told reporters after the meeting that he does not think continuing the state of emergency for only a short period would be enough, although the central government would decide how long the extended measure will last. The prefecture is asking the neighboring Kyoto and Hyogo prefectures, which are also covered by the state of emergency, to jointly seek an extension, according to Osaka prefectural government sources. Osaka Prefecture currently bans bars and restaurants from serving alcohol and asks them to shorten their operating hours. It is also requesting large facilities, such as department stores and movie theaters, to close temporarily at the governor’s discretion. Osaka Mayor Ichiro Matsui said that if the state of emergency continues beyond May 31, the Osaka prefectural government should review its anti-virus measures, which are stricter than those taken in other areas under the emergency declaration.

Japanese nationals arriving from India, Pakistan, Nepal, Bangladesh, Maldives and Sri Lanka will likely be required to stay at an accommodation facility designated by the quarantine station for 10 days, extended from the current six-day isolation period. They will also be required to be tested for COVID-19 five times, one more than the existing requirement, before and after their entry to Japan. Japan has already banned entries of foreign nationals traveling from these six countries, in principle, regardless of their visa status. But the central government agreed on further tightening border controls, weeks after the Indian variants have already been spreading throughout Japan. Currently, Japanese nationals arriving from these six countries are required to be tested before arrival, upon arrival, three days after entering Japan and six days after entering. But under the newly proposed rule, they will be required to take an additional test on the 10th day after entry. If they test negative for the novel coronavirus, they will then be allowed to move from the designated accommodation facility to their home.

The twin alerts don’t ban U.S. citizens from visiting the country, but they could have an impact on insurance rates for travelers and may factor into decisions by Olympic athletes and spectators on whether to compete in or attend the games, which are due to start in July. There was no immediate indication as to what effect the warnings might have on would-be Olympic-goers. “Travelers should avoid all travel to Japan,” the Atlanta-based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in a new COVID-19 update. “Because of the current situation in Japan even fully vaccinated travelers may be at risk for getting and spreading COVID-19 variants and should avoid all travel to Japan.” The State Department's warning, which followed the CDC alert, was more blunt. “Do not travel to Japan due to COVID-19,” it said in the announcement, which raised the department's travel alert from Level 3 — Reconsider travel — to Level 4 — Do not travel. The previous alert was issued on April 21. The United States Olympic & Paralympic Committee said it still anticipates that American athletes will be able to safely compete at the Tokyo Games. “We feel confident that the current mitigation practices in place for athletes and staff by both the USOPC and the Tokyo Organizing Committee, coupled with the testing before travel, on arrival in Japan, and during Games time, will allow for safe participation of Team USA athletes this summer,” the committee said in a statement Monday. Earlier Monday, Japan mobilized military doctors and nurses to give shots to older adults in two major cities, as the government tried desperately to accelerate its vaccination rollout and curb coronavirus infections before it hosts the Olympics. That move came amid growing calls for the games to be canceled. Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga is determined to hold the Olympics in Tokyo beginning on July 23, after a one-year delay, and has made an ambitious pledge to finish vaccinating the country’s 36 million older people by the end of July. Japan has recorded just over 12,000 COVID-19 deaths — good by global standards, but poor in Asia — but Tokyo and Osaka and several other areas are under a state of emergency until May 31 that is likely to be extended.

In Tokyo, a resident of Suginami Ward was administered a jab at 8 a.m. at the inoculation center set up in a central government building in Chiyoda Ward. The man, who will turn 65 this year, said he canceled an appointment he had made with his ward as he could secure a slot at the mass vaccination site, part of the central government program. “I am feeling safer since I got my first jab,” said the man, who will be traveling to Indonesia to teach Japanese when the novel coronavirus pandemic is brought under control. The shots at the Tokyo and Osaka sites for people aged 65 or older are being given by doctors and nurses with the Self-Defense Forces. Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga is pushing to complete the inoculations of Japan’s 36 million seniors by the end of July. On May 24, 5,000 doses and 2,500 doses will have been administered at each site, respectively. Vaccinations will be doubled at both locations starting from next week. For this week, those eligible to get vaccinated are seniors living in the capital’s 23 wards and in Osaka. The eligibility will be expanded to all the elderly in Tokyo and Osaka Prefecture from next week. At the Osaka location, a 69-year-old man in Osaka who cares for his mother, 96, was among the first recipients. “I was worried about being infected with the coronavirus as I heard that a variant is more transmissible,” he said. “I feel at ease now after enduring many days of being anxious.” The Osaka vaccination center was set up in the Osaka International Convention Center in the city’s Kita Ward.

In addition, Tokyo, Hokkaido and 15 other prefectures are considering following suit. However, a challenge cited by most of these prefectures is securing large numbers of health care workers to administer doses, the survey showed. Municipalities across the nation began the rollout for people 65 or older on April 12 as the main organizers of the inoculation program. But a calculation by The Asahi Shimbun, based on data from the Cabinet Office and official figures of registration of residents as of January 2020, showed that the share of seniors who have received at least one dose totaled only 2.6 percent as of May 16. Japan has an elderly population of about 36 million. Prefectural authorities’ efforts to set up their own vaccination centers comes as large-scale vaccination centers, which are operated by the Self-Defense Forces, opened in Tokyo and Osaka for the elderly on May 24. Tokyo and the three neighboring prefectures of Saitama, Chiba and Kanagawa are home to 9 million seniors. Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga set a target of completing immunizations of residents 65 and older by the end of July. The central government is pushing the mass immunization drive under a slogan of “1 million jabs a day.” It plans to provide prefectural authorities with subsidies to set up vaccination centers supplied with U.S. drug maker Moderna Inc.’s vaccine, whose use was authorized in Japan on May 21. The prefectures that have either opened or plan to open mass sites are Miyagi, Gunma, Saitama, Fukui, Aichi, Mie, Kyoto, Osaka, Hyogo, Tottori, Hiroshima, Tokushima, Fukuoka, Nagasaki and Miyazaki. Of these, Miyagi, Gunma and Aichi prefectures were expected to begin administering doses on May 24, according to the study. Miyagi’s daily target is 2,100 doses, while Gunma began with 100-200 jabs and will eventually increase that number to 1,000. Aichi aims to achieve 3,000 shots by setting up two mass vaccination sites. Saitama will open such a venue on June 1, while Tokushima is eying an early June opening. Kyoto, Osaka and Hyogo plan to set up centers in the middle of June. The targeted daily doses widely vary from one prefecture to the next. Tottori said its target is from 200 to 400 per day. Hyogo said it will establish a mass vaccination center to make doses available to residents with underlying health conditions as soon as possible by completing the rollout for the elderly. Saitama is seeking to make up for local governments that are unlikely to finish the vaccination schedule by the end of July. Gunma will open a mass vaccination center in an area where the ratio of doctors and nurses is low on a per capita basis. Niigata, one of the 17 prefectures considering mass vaccination centers, said it will be a big plus for the prefecture to set up a mass site as the effort secures supplies of Moderna vaccines from the central government. Tokyo is still considering setting up its own center for the elderly. But Tokyo officials said on May 21 that they will use the former site of the Tsukiji fish market in Chuo Ward to inoculate police officers and firefighters in the capital. Despite the 1 million doses per day slogan by the central government, the maximum the country can fulfill currently is 500,000 doses. Taro Kono, a minister in charge of coordinating the vaccination program, urged local authorities on May 21 to speed up mass inoculations using the Moderna vaccine, which the government has contracted for 50 million doses.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14356896

The advisory was in the form of an email sent May 19 by the Itako public health center in Itako to the Hokota city government in the prefecture and Hokota's local agricultural cooperative. The intention was to share it among farmers hiring foreign workers. Citing numerous COVID-19 cases in foreign communities and farms where many foreign nationals worked, the document urged farmers to remember “to wear masks when conversing with foreigners” and “not dine with foreigners.” After being alerted to the advisory on May 21, officials in charge of infectious diseases at the prefectural government urged the Itako public health center to cancel the guidance. “The advisory may cause misunderstandings because it targeted foreigners,” a prefectural official said. Hokota, with a population of 48,000, had a high ratio of foreign nationals among its residents. Most of them work as technical intern trainees who came to Japan from developing countries.

The contract with AstraZeneca is for enough doses for 60 million people, but due to reports from abroad of the vaccine causing side effects in rare cases that lead to thrombosis, further studies will be conducted before deciding who it can be administered to. The two vaccines were given the green light under a special approval procedure based on the results of clinical testing overseas, such as the vaccine jointly developed by U.S. pharmaceutical company Pfizer Inc. and German biocommerce company BioNTech, which is now being used on senior citizens. Moderna’s vaccine must be stored at minus 20 degrees, and like Pfizer’s vaccine, uses genetic material called Messenger RNA. AstraZeneca’s vaccine can be stored under refrigeration at around 2 to 8 degrees and uses a virus vector that delivers necessary genetic material.

The only COVID-19 vaccine currently approved for emergency use in Japan is developed by Pfizer Inc. Formal approval of the two additional vaccines is expected Friday by a broader vaccine policy panel, officials said. Health Minister Norihisa Tamura said approval of the additional vaccines will help speed up inoculations. Japan has administered one or more vaccine doses to roughly 5 million people, or just 4 percent of the population. As the government pushes to host the Olympics in about two months, accelerating vaccinations is key to warding off mounting public concern about the safety of the event. Recent polls have found that more than 80 percent of Japanese oppose hosting the Olympics this summer. Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga has pledged to finish vaccinating the country’s roughly 36 million elderly population by the end of July, when the games are to be held. However, a government survey of 1,741 municipalities released last week found around 15 percent will not be able to meet the deadline. On Monday, the government will open mass-vaccination sites in two of the country’s biggest metropolitan areas, Tokyo and Osaka, with the goal of administering vaccines to up to 15,000 elderly people a day. Moderna shots are to be used at the sites.

1,Kumamoto OKs local officials to get vaccine shots if canceled,['By SHOMEI NAGATSUMA/ Staff Writer'],"May 20, 2021 at 18:51 JST"," KUMAMOTO--To justify getting COVID-19 shots ahead of the elderly or medical personnel, Kumamoto officials here have made the practice permissible for local government heads and others if there are cancellations of appointments. The Kumamoto prefectural government, its mayors’ association and other groups made the guidelines on May 19 to allow municipal heads and others to receive vaccine shots in the event of cancellations. It marks the first time in Japan that such a guideline on vaccinations has been created, according to a prefectural official. Recently, municipal government leaders in Ibaraki and Hyogo prefectures and others evoked controversy when it was found they had received jabs ahead of the elderly and medical personnel. They justified the shots by saying that there were cancellations of vaccinations or they were in charge of their town's vaccination program. When Kumamoto Governor Ikuo Kabashima exchanged ideas with the head of its mayors’ association and head of the town and village association on May 14, he disclosed his plan for the prefecture to make its own rules to avoid similar criticism. “If rules are set and people get canceled vaccine shots based on the rules, there will be no problems,” Kabashima said. Takashi Kimura, vice governor of the prefecture, said at a May 19 news conference that there is a certain ""mood"" among the public that local officials should not get preferential treatment, but there may be some necessity for doing so. “But they should not receive shots behind people’s backs,"" Kimura said. ""I want them to get vaccinated after their policies are made public in advance. The guidelines for Kumamoto designate who will be eligible for vaccinations when inoculation centers receive unexpected cancellations. Those eligible include workers at inoculation centers, heads of municipal governments, local officials who are in charge of anti-COVID-19 measures and day care personnel who work with the elderly or disabled people.

0,Experts: Virus numbers still too high to lift state of emergency,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"May 20, 2021 at 15:29 JST"," New COVID-19 cases have decreased in some areas of Japan, but not enough to warrant a lifting of the state of emergency as scheduled on May 31, health experts have warned. They said many affected places have yet to show they can emerge from the most serious stage of the health crisis. “It is too early to judge now, but lifting the emergency may be difficult,” a member of a health ministry panel of experts on COVID-19 said a May 19 meeting. Tokyo, Osaka, Hyogo, Kyoto, Aichi, Fukuoka, Okayama, Hokkaido and Hiroshima prefectures are covered under the latest state of emergency to stem the spread of novel coronavirus infections. Under one of the criteria set by a government task force, the state of emergency can be lifted only after the number of new COVID-19 cases drops below the most serious stage of a four-level classification. Stage 4 for this category is a situation in which there are 25 or more new infections per 100,000 people over a week. Cabinet Secretariat data as of May 18 showed the figure for Hokkaido was 72 and 64 for Fukuoka Prefecture, while the numbers exceeded 50 in Aichi, Osaka, Okayama and Hiroshima prefectures. In Tokyo, it was 38, about 40 percent of the peak in January, when the capital was struck by the third wave of infections. Data compiled by The Asahi Shimbun showed that on March 1, when the second state of emergency was lifted for Osaka Prefecture, the prefecture’s number was 5.7. On March 22, after Tokyo emerged from the second state of emergency, the figure for the capital was 15.3. Health experts said the number of new cases has not declined substantially despite more stringent anti-coronavirus measures being taken under the state of emergency or for pre-emergency periods. They said more contagious variants have taken root and are causing numerous outbreaks. Shigeru Omi, an infectious disease expert who heads the government task force, said the state of emergency should not be lifted when new case numbers are hovering at high levels. “It is crucial to first make sure the infection trajectory is on stage 3 and steadily moving toward stage 2,” he said at a May 7 news conference. A stage 3 situation is when 15 or more new cases per 100,000 people are reported over a week. Some experts said the bar should be set even higher for Tokyo to prevent a quick rebound in infections in the densely populated capital. They suggested that Tokyo’s daily count of new cases should be down to around 100 before the state of emergency is lifted. The capital reported 766 new cases on May 19 and 843 on May 20. With the exception of Tokyo, health care systems have been stretched in all prefectures under the state of emergency. Half or more of their hospital beds for COVID-19 patients are occupied, putting the prefectures at stage 4 in that category. The situation is particularly dire in Fukuoka and Okayama prefectures, where more than 80 percent of the beds are filled. In Osaka Prefecture, the number of hospitalized COVID-19 patients is more than five times the lowest figure for stage 4--30 or more patients per 100,000 people. Fukuoka Prefecture has reported more than triple the lowest number for stage 4 categorization. Also disturbing is a surge in the number of COVID-19 patients in serious condition, with the national total hitting a record 1,293 on May 18. The collective number of such cases for the Kansai prefectures of Osaka, Hyogo and Kyoto stood at 493, 39 fewer than from May 1. But some experts suspect that figures for severely ill patients in some prefectures, including Osaka, may be underreported because of the lack of hospital beds secured for them. As for Tokyo and the three neighboring prefectures of Saitama, Kanagawa and Chiba, serious COVID-19 cases rose by 52 to 216. The remaining 40 prefectures in Japan accounted for 584 serious cases, 230 more than the number on May 1.

The number continued declining to 0.49 between Day 21 and Day 27, and 0.18 after Day 28. The number started declining after around Day 12, the institute said. In general, it takes a certain number of days after receiving a vaccine shot for a recipient to develop neutralizing antibodies that help prevent infections after inoculations.

A team of researchers at Hiroshima University, Kyoto University and other institutions also confirmed the effectiveness of the antibodies against coronavirus variants, which are likely to be more contagious than the original strain of the virus or reduce vaccines’ efficacy. “With blood samples collected from several survivors of COVID-19, we can now make neutralizing antibodies in just 10 days or so,” said Tomoharu Yasuda, a professor of immunology at Hiroshima University and a member of the research team. “We hope the antibodies will help prevent patients from becoming seriously ill and develop medicines to treat those with serious symptoms.” Patients who contracted the virus and recovered from the disease have antibodies in their blood produced by immune cells. Neutralizing antibodies bind to the virus and help prevent it from entering a cell. Scientists around the globe are racing to develop neutralizing antibodies since they can be used as medicines to treat COVID-19. The team analyzed blood samples collected from patients who recovered from the disease. It confirmed that patients with serious symptoms are more likely to have neutralizing antibodies generated in their blood than those with mild symptoms. The researchers then chose candidate immune cells, which produce neutralizing antibodies, from blood samples of four patients who were formerly seriously ill. They extracted a gene that produces antibodies from the selected immune cells and amplified the gene to create neutralizing antibodies. From those antibodies, the team picked ones that bind strongly to the virus strain that caused the initial outbreak of the virus in the Chinese city of Wuhan. The researchers found 97 percent of the antibodies also bind to the British variant, which is thought to be more transmissible, while 63 percent adhere to the South African variant, which is likely to make vaccines less effective. They confirmed that even a small amount of the antibodies that attach themselves to the British and South African variants is effective at staving off the virus. The team said it takes only 10 days or so to make neutralizing antibodies as the researchers successfully speeded up the process. The team added that it wants to create neutralizing antibodies that can protect people against the Indian variant, which is feared to be even more contagious.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14352539

0,Experts: Speed of vaccine rollout risks 4 more emergencies,['By KENJI TAMURA/ Senior Staff Writer'],"May 17, 2021 at 18:40 JST"," Japan will likely need to issue four more emergency declarations by April 2022 if its COVID-19 vaccination program does not significantly pick up the pace, experts warn. Researchers have crunched the numbers and are now calling on the government to inoculate citizens four times faster than the current speed to bring the pandemic under control. The study was done by Yasuharu Tokuda, who heads the Muribushi Okinawa Center for Teaching Hospitals, and Toshikazu Kuniya, an associate professor of mathematical biology at Kobe University. “The results of simulations may vary depending on other anti-virus measures, but the speed of inoculations still needs to be greatly accelerated,” Tokuda said. “I want the government to swiftly create an environment to realize that.” The researchers based their calculations on data of COVID-19 cases reported between Jan. 14, 2020, and April 20 this year, assuming that the government will issue a fresh state of emergency when the daily number of new infections tops 5,000 nationwide and will then lift the emergency declaration once the count dips below 1,000. Using a mathematical model, the researchers estimated what the infection situation will look like if the vaccine rollout continues at the pace seen around mid-April, when about 220,000 shots were being administered per day. They also took into account the spread of coronavirus variants. If the speed of the vaccination program remains unchanged, daily cases would exceed 5,000 around July, forcing the government to issue a state of emergency four more times by April next year, the study results showed. Even if people receive jabs twice as fast as that, three additional emergency declarations would still be needed. If the vaccination speed is four times as fast, the government would still have to issue another state of emergency around the end of July. But it would not likely face a surge in new infections after that. Administering 1 million shots a day is believed to be more than enough to vaccinate people four times faster than the current pace. The researchers published their modeling before the study was peer-reviewed to make the results quickly available to the public. The figures are available at: https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.05.06.21256476v1.full-text",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14351684

Some 21,000 of the 50,000 slots made available for the Tokyo site were filled 45 minutes after bookings began at 11 a.m. All 25,000 slots at the Osaka site had been booked 26 minutes after reservations were accepted, from around 1 p.m. People age 65 or older who have received a vaccination slip issued by their local governments can make reservations for the first dose only. They will be notified about the schedule for their second dose when they show up for the first shot. The slots made available on May 17 are expected to cover the vaccinations over a week from May 24, when the Tokyo and Osaka centers are scheduled to open. Japan has a population of 36 million who are 65 or older, designated a priority group for vaccination. Immunization of senior citizens has been under way under a program implemented by local governments. People in that age group, in Tokyo’s 23 wards and Osaka, are eligible for doses at the two sites, which will be operated by the Self-Defense Forces. While the central government intends to accelerate inoculations through the mass vaccination centers, it cautioned the public against double bookings as central and local government systems were not linked up. “As our systems are not equipped to remove double bookings, people seeking vaccinations at the SDF mass vaccination centers should make sure that they have not booked for doses provided by their local authorities,” Chief Cabinet Secretary Katsunobu Kato said on May 17. Bookings are accepted online only through dedicated sites and through the SDF's account on the Line messaging app. SDF medical staff will administer doses of U.S. drugmaker Moderna Inc.’s vaccine at the two sites over about three months. Applicants, to secure their appointments, need to type in a number assigned to each individual by local governments. To prevent the booking sites from crashing due to floods of reservations, applicants for the Tokyo venue were limited to residents of the capital's 23 wards and to Osaka at the Osaka site. Elderly people in other parts of Tokyo and Osaka Prefecture, in addition to those in Tokyo's 23 wards and Osaka, will be allowed to book slots from May 24 for doses to be administered between May 31 and June 6.

Surging numbers of novel coronavirus infection have stretched the prefecture's health care system to the limit and few rooms are available for new patients. An Asahi Shimbun tally shows that the death toll in the prefecture accounts for more than 20 percent of the nation’s overall fatalities since March. The prefecture has been in the grip of a fourth wave of infections that started in March, local authorities say. From April, accumulative deaths in the prefecture represented more than 30 percent of all fatalities across the nation. Since the middle of February, daily deaths from COVID19 had remained below double digits in Osaka Prefecture. But the toll began spiking sharply from late April. In May, more than 15 deaths were logged per day. Then on May 11, the prefecture reported 55 deaths, a record for a single 24-hour period. Deaths from COVID-19 around the nation since March 1 stood at 3,403 as of May 13. With 751 fatalities, Osaka Prefecture accounted for 22.1 percent of the national total. The figure rises to 32.2 percent if overall deaths since April 1 are taken into account. The average age of patients who died from the third wave of infections from Oct. 10 to late February was 78.0, prefectural officials said. Of these deaths, 98.1 percent of the patients were aged 60 or older. But in the current fourth wave, the average age of fatal cases dropped to 75.2 due to a sharp increase in the number of patients in their 50s or younger who succumbed to the disease. The ratio of patients in their 60s or older who died came to 93.1 percent. Prefectural officials attribute the growing death toll to the steep rise in new cases. Between April 13 and May 2, daily new cases topped 1,000 except for April 19 and April 26. The ratio of deaths among COVID-19 patients during the fourth wave stands at 1.0 percent, compared with 2.6 percent during the third wave. However, the number of deaths surged in conjunction with the sharp rise in new infections. Prefectural officials say they believe a variant, called B.1.1.7, which was first identified in Britain late last year triggered the fourth wave. This mutant is more contagious and more likely to result in death, according to reports from overseas. The pace of rise in the number of serious cases grew about three-fold from the third wave of infections in the prefecture, leaving hospitals with few unoccupied beds. As of May 12, the number of patients who have been hospitalized represented only 10 percent of people who tested positive for the novel coronavirus in the prefecture. About 15,000 people were staying at home without medical care at hospitals as of May 15. Osaka Governor Hirofumi Yoshimura warned that fatalities could surge in coming weeks, given the high number of patients denied access to care at hospitals.

At a May 14 meeting, the government’s expert panel on COVID-19 approved the new plan, which is expected to receive formal approval at the government’s task force meeting later in the day. Under the initial proposal made the previous day, the government planned to apply pre-emergency measures in the five prefectures of Gunma, Ishikawa, Okayama, Hiroshima and Kumamoto to stem the spread of the novel coronavirus. However, infections are rising across the nation, particularly in Hokkaido, Okayama and Hiroshima prefectures. Hokkaido has already been placed under the pre-emergency measures, but new COVID-19 cases there continue to increase, reaching a daily record of 712 on May 13, including 499 in the capital of Sapporo. The Hokkaido government has asked the central government to issue the state of emergency for Sapporo. The pre-emergency measures will still be issued for Gunma, Ishikawa and Kumamoto prefectures. These anti-virus measures will apply from May 16 to June 13, according to the new plan. Earlier this month, the state of emergency was extended until May 31 for Tokyo, Osaka, Hyogo and Kyoto prefectures. It also covers Aichi and Fukuoka prefectures. The initial proposal was made at a May 13 ministerial meeting that was attended by Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga and health minister Norihisa Tamura. Kazuhiro Tateda, a member of the expert panel and a professor at Toho University, explained how things changed. “I repeatedly said that no matter how you looked at Hokkaido, the situation is serious, and Okayama and Hiroshima, too,” he told reporters after the meeting on May 14. “I am glad that the government’s proposal was changed.” Tateda said other panel members also described Hokkaido, Okayama and Hiroshima prefectures as being in a serious situation, and that they should be immediately placed under the state of emergency. Yasutoshi Nishimura, who heads the central government’s efforts in dealing with the COVID-19 crisis, listened to the panel’s opinions, Tateda said. “Nishimura then left for a Cabinet meeting and talked about it with Suga there,” he said. “Nishimura came back here and said that he would submit a new proposal.” Under the state of emergency, businesses that serve alcohol, provide karaoke services or allow customers to bring in alcohol are asked to close their operations. That request, however, was eased for commercial outlets with a floor space of 1,000 square meters or more. They are allowed to stay open until 8 p.m. Venues for sports and other performances are asked to end such events by 9 p.m. Under eased rules, the venues can be filled to 50 percent of capacity, but only up to 5,000 people. Governors facing still high numbers of new cases have been given more flexibility on the measures, such as whether to continue asking large commercial outlets to shut operations and imposing more restrictions on events. The central government plans to restrict the business closure request in Hokkaido to areas where the local government was planning to apply pre-emergency measures. The pre-emergency measures are intended to prevent prefectures from entering the most serious stage 4 situation, which indicates an explosive growth in infections and would place them under a state of emergency.

Shirosato Mayor Osamu Katono, 42, revealed on May 13 that he had been vaccinated against COVID-19 in late April. He and 11 other town officials, including senior members and receptionists of vaccination centers, got inoculated because there were cancellations of vaccinations for medical personnel.

On April 26 and 28, 162 medical workers in the town were scheduled to get inoculated, but 12 canceled their appointments. In the event of cancellations, about 10 town officials were supposed to get the shots, but there were more cancellations than expected, according to the mayor. He said as he is in charge of the town’s vaccination program, “he received a shot so as not to bring administrative activities and vaccination projects to a standstill.” “I did not receive a high priority on the vaccinations,"" Katono said, adding, “I could be called a member of medical personnel because I established medical clinics to become vaccination centers. I followed the government’s notice.” In Hyogo Prefecture, Sogo Yamana, Kamikawa town mayor, 62, also received a vaccination on May 6, the first day of the town's group vaccination program for people aged 65 or older, although he was not eligible. “I have received one because I am in charge of crisis management,” he told The Asahi Shimbun on May 12. “I apologize for causing concerns and a disturbance among town residents.” According to Yamana, he considered the infection risk he is exposed to at Kanzaki Municipal General Hospital, which he founded and visits every week to attend meetings. He asked the deputy mayor in late April, “Can we make good use of vaccine doses for appointments that have been canceled or which will be wasted?” Yamana asked the deputy mayor to talk to hospital officials to allow him to be inoculated.

1,Study: Pfizer vaccine protects against variants of coronavirus,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"May 13, 2021 at 18:22 JST"," About 90 percent of people fully inoculated by the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine are well protected from variants of the novel coronavirus, having produced antibodies stimulated to better fight them off, Japanese researchers said on May 12. The vaccine is the only one currently available in Japan. A team of researchers at Yokohama City University reported the vaccine has a high efficacy against variants after analyzing how it protects against the original form of the virus and seven types of variants, including those believed to be highly contagious and can elude the immune system. The study includes the variant first detected in Britain, one identified in South Africa, one that has spread throughout Brazil and one raging in India. “The vaccine will very likely control the variants that have been identified so far,” said Takeharu Yamanaka, a professor of health data science at the university’s medical school. The same day, the National Institute of Infectious Diseases said the strain that devastated Britain now makes up more than 90 percent of the coronavirus infections discovered across Japan. Yokohama City University’s study involved 105 health care workers who tested negative for the virus before the study and were fully vaccinated between March and April. Their average age was 42. Researchers collected their blood samples prior to the first shot, and then again after the first and second shots, to examine whether enough neutralizing antibodies, a subset of immune system fighters, were produced in their blood to help prevent infection. Through the university’s own technology, researchers used virus-like particles that come with the coronavirus surface proteins, rather than the genuine coronavirus itself. The study found that after their first jab, 57 percent of the subjects produced enough neutralizing antibodies to protect themselves from the original version of the coronavirus, while that was not the case with variants. But after the second shot, 94 percent of the subjects were protected against the variant detected in Britain and 97 percent against the type identified in India. More than 90 percent of the people on average were protected against each of all variants. Researchers also found that separately from the 105 subjects, six people who already had antibodies to the novel coronavirus had generated enough neutralizing antibodies after receiving the first shot. To determine whether a sufficient number of neutralizing antibodies were produced, the team used the number required to stave off the original form of the coronavirus. Yamanaka noted there is a possibility that more neutralizing antibodies may be needed to defend against variants. The team plans to study how long the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine will be effective against variants, and how long vaccines from other drug makers will protect against variants. Apart from Pfizer, Japan has signed a deal with foreign drug makers Moderna and AstraZeneca over vaccine supplies.

Both vaccines are expected to be approved to use for people 18 or older. Two shots will be required for effective immunization. The central government has said it will secure 100 million doses of Moderna’s vaccine, which must be stored at minus 20 degrees. Like Pfizer Inc.’s vaccine, it uses genetic material called Messenger RNA. The government is expected to secure 150 million doses of AstraZeneca's vaccine but has not decided to whom the vaccine will be administered to. There have been reports of people experiencing thrombosis after receiving it, the cause of which is not yet known.

The suspect, who lives in Anjo in the prefecture, has admitted to the allegations of vandalism, police said. He tried to make a reservation for a COVID-19 vaccine shot at the hospital in Anjo, but his request was declined because he “was not a regular outpatient, and the hospital was unable to know his health condition,” according to the prefectural police’s Anjo Station. Infuriated by the rejection, the man kicked the door and shattered the glass around 8:30 a.m. on May 12, police said. The door was 1.8 meter high and 1.1 meter wide, police said. Municipal governments and hospitals nationwide started accepting reservations for the vaccine from people 65 years old or older on May 12. However, demand has far exceeded supply of the vaccine in many areas. Seniors have said they are only getting busy signals when they phone their local governments to make reservations.

1,"Ad with bamboo spears, virus was message ‘not to repeat mistakes’",['By TAKAHIRO KAWAMURA/ Staff Writer'],"May 13, 2021 at 16:56 JST"," A Tokyo-based publishing company defended its two-page newspaper advertisement that used World War II imagery to send a blunt message to the government about its handling of the COVID-19 pandemic. The ad by Takarajimasha Inc. read: “No vaccines. No medications. Are we supposed to fight with bamboo spears? If this goes on, we will be killed by politics.” It carried a picture reminiscent of wartime military drills for school children to learn to fight against the enemy with bamboo spears. In a prepared statement, a representative of the company said the ad was intended to send the government “a strong message that we should not repeat the same mistakes.” “People’s frustration with the central government, which has kept forcing people to show self-restraint, has reached a peak while the development, securing and administering of a vaccine has been delayed,” the representative said. The advertisement, which appeared in the morning print editions of three national newspapers—Asahi, Yomiuri and Nikkei—on May 11, generated a buzz on social media. Much of the reaction was positive, with some posters saying, “It’s dead-on” or “Thank you for saying that.” But others criticized the ad for likening anti-virus measures to unscientific bamboo-spear training. The representative explained: “The current circumstances in which only citizens are forced to bear the burden by wearing masks, washing hands, avoiding crowded places and showing self-restraint overlap with the unscientific war strategy during World War II that forced even little girls to do bamboo-spear training.” A large red spherical object resembling the novel coronavirus appeared in the center of the advertisement. In a smaller font, the ad read: “We are tricked. What was the last year after all? How long do we need to show self-restraint? We don’t want this game of patience anymore.” It continued: “Don’t make excuses, period. (It) just goes on torturing us, and nothing has changed. It’s high time to voice our anger.” Some observers said the red virus at the center made the ad look like Hinomaru, Japan’s rising sun flag. The representative said the advertisement was designed to look like a child was spearing the virus, and that any resemblance to the national flag was unintentional. The ad never specified the object of the criticism, but it was widely seen as a sharp rebuke of the central government’s response to the novel coronavirus crisis. The representative confirmed that the ad was intended to relay a message urging the government to learn from its past failures in preparing for or taking effective action against the virus, and to make the maximum effort and offer thorough explanations from now. Since 1998, Takarajimasha has occasionally placed advertisements that included social messages. In January this year, the company created an ad that featured the phrase, “It is said that the spread of infections by close contact with (a patient) is individual responsibility.” The representative said the company places such advertisements “not as an organ of public opinion or of a publishing firm,” but it rather considers the practice as “a role of a company.” “It’s the company’s pleasure to use advertisements that make people feel something and give them an opportunity to think about something,” the representative said.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14347702

Many said the declaration has no effect on their lives. Some were elated that the government allowed for an easing of anti-virus measures, but others questioned if those relaxed rules were sending a mixed signal on the seriousness of the novel coronavirus situation. The state of emergency, initially scheduled to end on May 11, was extended in Tokyo, Osaka, Kyoto and Hyogo prefectures until May 31. Aichi and Fukuoka prefectures were added to the list from May 12. Just after 8 a.m. on May 12, commuters and high school students formed lengthy lines at the ticket gates of JR Ueno Station in Tokyo. “I am disappointed that the (state of emergency) has been extended,” a 55-year-old accountant said at the station. He said the central government’s decision to extend the state of emergency “does not particularly change the nature of my work.” “That is why I am commuting today, just like I did yesterday,” he said. Although government authorities have urged people to work from home, he said he is allowed to telework only once or twice a month. “I don’t think the virus will be contained soon unless (the government) imposes a lockdown at least,” he said. “I think everybody is fed up with the same old routine.” Tokyo is now under its third state of emergency. All of them have been extended. But under this extension, the central government allowed an easing of requests for businesses to restrict crowd sizes or shut down. The central government planned to reopen five national facilities in Ueno, including the National Museum of Nature and Science, on May 12. However, the decision was reversed on May 11 after the Tokyo metropolitan government sent a strong request to the Cultural Affairs Agency. On May 12, a “closed” sign appeared at the entrance of the Tokyo National Museum in Ueno Park. Among the three Kansai prefectures of Osaka, Kyoto and Hyogo, large-scale commercial facilities are taking different approaches under the extended state of emergency. Department stores in Kyoto and Hyogo prefectures had closed all floors except the ones that sold essential goods, such as food. But now, floors and sections selling nonessential items are open on weekdays. Daimaru Kyoto in Kyoto’s Shimogyo Ward reopened all shops. About 20 people waited in line before the department store opened at 10 a.m. A 42-year-old man who owns a restaurant in the city said he visited the department store to check out expensive watches. “I come here all the time, but I couldn’t because of the state of emergency,” he said. “I can finally take them in my hand to have a look.” However, in Osaka Prefecture, where the medical system is under enormous strain from the increase in COVID-19 patients, department stores kept nonessential floors and sections closed, complying with the prefectural government’s request. In Fukuoka Prefecture, commuters and students wearing masks came and went at JR Hakata Station on the morning of the prefecture’s first day under the state of emergency.

Many commuters were also seen at JR Nagoya Station just past 8 a.m. on May 12. “It seems the crowds are a little smaller but not much different,” said a 50-year-old man who works at a nearby office of an IT company.

Ito, an Otsu resident, attended a news conference at the Shiga prefectural government office on May 10 to talk about her uplifting recovery. She had to be hospitalized for a month and her condition even worsened at one point. “I trusted my doctor and depended on him completely,” Ito said, adding that it was important to have a strong will to overcome one's own difficulties. Taku Yamaguchi, 41, of Omihachiman Community Medical Center, Ito’s primary doctor during her hospitalization, also attended the news conference.

Ito initially had only a cough, but from around the third day at the hospital, she developed a fever of around 38 degrees. Her peripheral oxygen saturation level was dropping, so she was hooked up to oxygen and treated with steroids. After about two weeks, she did not need to be administered oxygen. Ito went into rehab and was released from the hospital on Feb. 5. “I have no idea why or how I got infected,” she said. “I was three times more careful than others.” She said that she had great confidence in her doctor and tried to remain strong mentally, as COVID-19 poses an especially severe health risk to older patients. “Ito had been healthy before she got infected,” Yamaguchi said. “She often tried to talk and kept a positive attitude all the time.” He believes that she recovered well mainly because of self-encouragement and positivity.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14347029

1,Officials to call on those who fail to abide by Japan’s virus entry rules,['By TATSUYA SATO/ Staff Writer'],"May 11, 2021 at 19:01 JST"," Japan is dispatching enforcement officials for follow-up checks on people entering the country in response to entrants failing to abide by the anti-coronavirus measure to stay home for two weeks after their arrival here. The move comes after health ministry data showing that 300 entrants per day are flouting the government’s rule for them to inform authorities of their location and health on each day of the isolation period. Renho, a senior member of the main opposition Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan, raised concerns at an Upper House Budget Committee session on May 10. “Some 300 people cannot be reached per day, but we don’t know if they got sick or infected,” she said. “It could contribute to the spread of the virus.” The government will send inspectors to the homes or accommodations of entrants found to have skipped the safety protocol to confirm their whereabouts more frequently than before. As a step against the novel coronavirus, the government has requested people arriving in Japan from overseas to stay home for 14 days to restrict their movements and contact with others even if they test negative for the virus. About 20,000 to 24,000 people are asked to follow the protocol each day, according to the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare. Entrants, under the setup, must report daily to an entity commissioned by the health ministry on their location and health conditions, such as if they have a fever or a cough, using a smartphone app or email that they registered at their point of entry. Arrivals are allowed to enter Japan only after signing a written pledge to do so. But up to 300 people defy the rule per day, according to the health ministry. In response, the government’s task force on May 7 decided to take more rigorous measures to bring them in line. Inspectors will now visit the addresses that entrants registered as where they will be staying while in Japan to confirm if they are actually there. Entrants who don't answer phone calls from officials inquiring over their whereabouts will get an email from the government warning that their names could be disclosed to the public due to their negligence. Between March 26 and April 30, the health ministry only called those who failed to report. But the ministry began sending enforcement officials in May to drop in on some of those who neglected to do so and since May 7 has been sending them more frequently. Those who break their written pledge, however, won't face jail time or any other penalty. “It's difficult to impose a penalty as freedom of movement is guaranteed under the Constitution,” a health ministry official said.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14346386

Nishio Vice Mayor Yoshihide Kondo said at a news conference that he tried to “do a favor” for Hirokazu Sugiura, the 70-year-old founder and chairman of pharmacy giant Sugi Holdings Co., and his wife because “the city has received assistance (from the company) in many forms.” Takaou Yanase, manager of the city government’s health and welfare department, which manages a division in charge of the vaccination program, said a secretary at Sugi Holdings, operator of the Sugi Pharmacy drugstores, had repeatedly demanded that the city give the couple priority in receiving the shots. He said the secretary made about three calls to the division’s manager-class personnel. “Before that, we received several phone calls, too,” Yanase said. “I, myself, received three or four calls. The pattern continued of us saying ‘no’ and them calling back again.” The company on May 11 also apologized to residents of the city. In a statement, the company said the secretary was worried about the chairman's wife who has a pre-existing condition. It also said the chairman doesn't want the vaccination out of concerns he would suffer from an anaphylactic reaction. According to the municipal government, the secretary first contacted city officials in mid-April and asked if Sugiura and his wife, Akiko, 67, an executive adviser for the company, could receive priority in receiving COVID-19 shots. The secretary explained that the couple, both residents of the city, are pharmacists and should be considered health care workers. A city employee rejected the request. But the Sugi secretary kept contacting the city government. “We told Sugi from the get-go that this is a special consideration,” Yanase said. “To be honest, we wanted to refuse it. But it went beyond a regular request. He also quoted the secretary as saying, “The chairman is looking forward to receiving a vaccination.” Yanase said he consulted Kondo about the matter. Kondo recalled saying, “Can you work it out?” He admitted that he instructed the health department to ensure the couple receive priority in vaccine reservations. A tentative reservation for the couple was made for May 10, the first day of the city’s vaccine rollout for elderly people. The couple were supposed to call the division to complete the reservation. Kondo, however, said the appointment was canceled on May 10 after a third party pointed out ethical problems with the arrangement. “I apologize to the city’s residents for ignoring impartiality in terms of handling the valuable vaccine,” Kondo said. He noted that the company has lent a gym for senior citizens to the city for free. He also said Sugi Pharmacy signed a comprehensive partnership agreement with the municipal government to support various projects of the city. Asked if he would resign, Kondo said, “I want to consult the mayor about my next course of action.” Kondo said he never consulted Nishio Mayor Ken Nakamura about the vaccine matter. Nakamura told the news conference: “At the moment, we want to find out the truth and implement preventive measures in full force. Reprimands will be needed afterward.” Sugi Holdings, which is headquartered in Obu in the prefecture, operates around 1,400 Sugi Pharmacy drugstores mainly in the Tokai and Kansai regions. The couple founded the company in Nishio in December 1976. They converted the company into a joint stock corporation in 1982, and Sugiura became the president. He is expected to step down as chairman, a post he has held since 2009, and become a special adviser this month.

Officials of the national university said the commitment form is nonbinding and seeks to secure the safety of students. Mie University was at the center of a major cluster last summer that prompted criticism from the prefectural governor. But some students and faculty on campus are criticizing the university's latest measure as a violation of human rights. “All classes were held online last year,"" said a student who lives in Mie Prefecture, which is not under a state of emergency. "" We are finally able to go to campus. But now this? I feel nothing but anger and appalled.” The form lists eight pledges including, “I will take adequate infection prevention measures,” “I will eat by myself on campus,” “I will not attend a dinner party in Mie Prefecture regardless of the number of attendees or time,” “I will refrain from traveling” and “I will not do karaoke.” Students are asked to check each box, write in their names, student ID number, the name of their department and school year, and submit it to the university. Currently, the university holds classes both online and in person on campus. In late April, the third state of emergency over the novel coronavirus pandemic was issued in Tokyo and Osaka, Hyogo and Kyoto prefectures. The university officials then started asking students who live in these areas to contact the university in advance when they attend an in-person class on campus and submit the form. Because Aichi and Fukuoka prefectures are added to the state of emergency that kicks in on May 12, the university is currently asking students who live in the two prefectures to do the same. The university said there is no punishment for those who do not comply with the request. But a professor at the university said: “It is inconceivable. What does (the university) think of students’ human rights? “The university should think about anti-virus measures and create a campus life together with students,” the professor said. A representative of the university’s department of academic affairs said, “We want the students living in the area under the state of emergency to have a high level of consciousness, in particular.” The form is “a measure to encourage students’ self-awareness and maintain their safety,” the representative said. Four COVID-19 clusters involving Mie University students have occurred so far. Infection sources include a students’ dinner party. Between Aug. 3 and 5, 2020, a total of 22 students who studied medicine and nursing science tested positive for the novel coronavirus. Of these, 11 traveled to Wakayama Prefecture in a group in late June, and one student visited a nightlife district in the Kansai region around the same time.

The National Governors’ Association set out a list of emergency recommendations to the central government at an online meeting on May 10, warning the infection situation has become so serious that expanding the state of emergency nationwide should be in the cards. They raised concerns that the steep rise in infections is putting the health care system at risk of collapse, and urged the government to immediately move on to stronger anti-virus measures that go beyond the existing policy framework. Ryuta Ibaragi, governor of Okayama Prefecture, which reported a record high number of new COVID-19 cases on May 8, touched on the country’s first state of emergency that was expanded in April 2020 to cover the entire nation. “We must draw on the experience of successfully curbing the spread of the virus with that decision (to expand the emergency declaration nationwide),” Ibaragi said. Shiga Governor Taizo Mikazuki echoed Ibaragi’s view, saying now is the time to issue a nationwide state of emergency, while Yamaguchi Governor Tsugumasa Muraoka called for tougher anti-virus measures across Japan. Governors of all 47 prefectures attended the meeting. “The central government declares a state of emergency, but prefectures also need to press the government to do so,” Tokushima Governor Kamon Iizumi, who is also the president of the association, told reporters after the meeting. The Suga administration’s latest emergency declaration, which covers Tokyo as well as Osaka, Kyoto and Hyogo prefectures, would have expired on May 11, but will be extended until May 31. The central government also decided to expand the scope to include Aichi and Fukuoka prefectures, starting from May 12. The government on May 7 decided to expand areas covered by pre-emergency measures, but chose not to apply them to Ibaraki, Ishikawa and Tokushima prefectures, despite requests that their jurisdictions be included. Many governors criticized that decision at the May 10 meeting. “It’s crucial to implement (pre-emergency) measures in a timely manner when they are needed,” said Fukushima Governor Masao Uchibori. “The government should swiftly approve the measures.” In its recommendations, the association also noted that in some cases, the government has decided not to grant governors’ requests to apply pre-emergency measures to their prefectures and expressed reluctance to approve the measures when discussing the matter with prefectural governments.

Many local governments around Japan began accepting vaccination reservations from senior citizens over the phone or internet on May 10. But the limited supply of vaccines and the “first come, first served” nature of the reservation system led to a flood of calls and overwhelmed internet connections. Many callers only got a busy signal, sometimes for days. An 83-year-old woman who lives by herself in Tachikawa, western Tokyo, does not have a computer or smartphone. She also has no one she can depend on to make a reservation on her behalf. She tried calling from May 6 when the city government began taking reservations, but she still had not succeeded as of May 10. “I may try again at the end of this month,” the woman said. “I will have to be resigned if I come down with COVID-19 in the meantime.” In nearby Higashi-Kurume also in western Tokyo, about 30 senior citizens who could not get through to the phone reservation system gathered at the city government building. A 70-year-old man in the group said he called about 30 times from 9 a.m. when the phone reservation system began but could not get connected. A city government official said that to avoid congestion, reservations were not being taken at the section where inquiries can be made. Narashino in Chiba Prefecture also began accepting phone reservations at 8:30 a.m., but all available vaccines were taken in 30 minutes. A 77-year-old man who could not get through by phone turned to the city government’s website only to find there were no more shots. “My grandchild who is taking online college classes due to the pandemic will help me the next time, so I plan to use both the internet and phone when reservations begin again,” he said. In Kawagoe, Saitama Prefecture, the limited supply of vaccines forced the city government to delay by about a month the mailing of vaccination vouchers to residents in the 65-to-74 age group. The Kawagoe municipal government began accepting reservations from those 75 and older on May 6. Although there are about 48,000 residents in that oldest age group, the city government set a limit of about 6,200 vaccination reservations for the first round. One city official in charge of the program said the delivery of vaccines was slower than expected. With more than 40,000 residents 75 and older who have not even placed a reservation, the city government decided to hold off on mailing the vouchers to the next younger age bracket. In western Japan, a programming glitch has forced the Uji city government in Kyoto Prefecture to abandon use of an internet reservation system for vaccinations. Senior citizens are now being encouraged to call, fax or mail applications for vaccine reservations. City government officials discovered a security deficiency in the internet reservation system, which was developed by an outside contractor. They said the system will not be used for the time being.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14346270

1,Doctors plan less claustrophobic transport unit for virus patients,['By FUMI YADA/ Staff Writer'],"May 10, 2021 at 07:00 JST"," SUITA, Osaka Prefecture--A hospital here, frustrated by the poor design of isolators for transporting novel coronavirus patients, is developing its own and turning to crowdfunding to cover the costs. Doctors at Osaka University Hospital have designed a capsule-shaped isolation unit that is more spacious for patients and safer for medical personnel transporting them. The hospital has been using soft bag-type plastic isolators to prevent secondary infections from patients to doctors and nurses during transportation. But their plastic film is apt to stick to the patient’s body, making them feel claustrophobic. Medical personnel also have difficulties checking the patient when the film wrinkles. It also takes about two hours to prepare the units for use and to disinfect them afterward. Other commercially available isolators have similar problems, so the hospital decided to develop an original model designed by its doctors. “After seeing many patients up close, I was hoping that there would be a gentler way to carry them,” said paramedic Haruna Maebe, 61. “We want to reduce the burden on patients.” The crowdfunding campaign has met its goal of 10 million yen ($92,000), but it will continue until the end of May. An artist’s rendition of a patient isolation unit designed by doctors at Osaka University Hospital (Provided by Osaka University Hospital) The new model measures 200 centimeters long, 70 cm high and 60 cm wide, giving the patient enough space to sit up. It uses transparent resin and aluminum materials that ensure the isolator keeps its shape and provides better visibility for medical staff. Osaka University Hospital treats COVID-19 patients with severe symptoms at its Trauma and Acute Critical Care Center and other departments. Patients who have recovered to a stable condition are transferred in isolators to other hospitals to free up beds for incoming patients with severe symptoms. The hospital had transported 54 patients by April 6. The hospital intends to place orders for the isolators with a manufacturing company and begin using them by the end of March.

Within hours of Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga's May 7 announcement that the state of emergency would be extended until May 31 for Tokyo, Osaka, Hyogo and Kyoto prefectures and applied to Aichi and Fukuoka as well, officials in Tokyo and Osaka said they will continue their requests to local businesses to remain closed during the period. The central government had included a number of relaxations of requests, but the continued high COVID-19 case numbers in Tokyo and Osaka led officials there to stick with the stricter measures. While Suga tried to tout the effectiveness of past steps in reducing the flow of people in public spaces, he was forced to acknowledge that Tokyo, Osaka, Aichi and Fukuoka prefectures were at the most serious stage 4 in guidelines to determine the spread of infections in each jurisdiction. He cited that as his primary reason for extending the emergency. The central government said May 7 that commercial establishments with floor space of 1,000 square meters or greater could remain open until 8 p.m. However, Tokyo metropolitan government officials said they would continue to ask venues in that category to remain closed. Osaka prefectural authorities also decided May 7 to continue with the requests to large commercial establishments to remain closed. Tokyo will also continue with closure requests to movie theaters, department stores, shopping centers, video game centers and gymnasiums. It will also seek the cooperation of such businesses even if they have floor space under 1,000 square meters. One relaxation measure proposed by the central government that the Tokyo metropolitan government will go along with concerns sporting and other events. Sporting events in the capital had been held without fans in the stands, but from May 12 will be allowed to be filled to up to 50 percent capacity so long as the maximum number of fans does not exceed 5,000. Event organizers will also be asked to end the events by 9 p.m. Tokyo metropolitan high schools will continue to be asked to encourage online classes, staggered commutes to school and suspend extracurricular activities. Faced with a much tighter situation in its medical care structure, Osaka Governor Hirofumi Yoshimura said May 7 that requests to hold sporting events without fans in the stands will be continued. Yoshimura told reporters it was not appropriate to relax such steps given the high number of new COVID-19 cases that has filled hospital beds for those with serious symptoms to close to capacity. The other four prefectures to be covered by the extended state of emergency will also generally go along with the measures proposed by the central government. The Hyogo and Kyoto prefectural governments will ask large commercial establishments to close at 7 p.m. on weekdays and remain closed throughout the day on weekends.

Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga on May 7 extended the state of emergency after receiving requests from Tokyo, Osaka, Hyogo and Kyoto prefectures to keep it in place beyond the scheduled May 11 deadline. Suga also told a government task force meeting to deal with the pandemic that Aichi and Fukuoka prefectures would be covered by the state of emergency from May 12 to 31. “We will thoroughly implement measures that we feel will be highly effective as the nation returns to a normal calendar after the Golden Week of national holidays,” Suga said. He added that the effects from measures already in place could be seen in the major reduction of the flow of people in Tokyo and Osaka. But he explained that the state of emergency had to be extended because of the high numbers of new cases in the major urban centers and the strained medical care situation in Osaka and Hyogo prefectures. Businesses that serve alcohol in the six prefectures will be asked to close operations for the duration of the state of emergency. However, the previous closure request to commercial outlets with a floor space of 1,000 square meters or more will be eased. Those establishments will be allowed to stay open until 8 p.m. Measures concerning crowd capacity for sporting and other events will also be relaxed. Venues in the four prefectures covered by the state of emergency have held such events without spectators in the stands. The eased rules will allow a 50-percent capacity of the venues, but only up to 5,000 people. Governors facing still high numbers of new cases, such as in Tokyo and Osaka, will be given more flexibility on the measures, such as whether to continue asking large commercial outlets to shut operations and ban all spectators.

0,Virus experts: Golden Week likely the calm before the storm,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"May 7, 2021 at 17:22 JST"," Health officials are warning against false assurances from the lower infection numbers reported during the Golden Week holidays, saying signs actually point to a more dire COVID-19 situation in the coming weeks. “New cases appear to be ebbing now but that is because fewer people got themselves tested for the virus during the Golden Week holidays,” health minister Norihisa Tamura told a meeting of an expert panel advising the ministry on the pandemic on May 6. The national daily average of new COVID-19 cases for the week between April 22 and April 28 was 4,923. The comparable figure was 4,886 per day between April 29 and May 5, when the holiday period ended. The daily average number of diagnostic tests conducted nationwide for the virus was 64,457 in April. The figure decreased by about 30 percent to 44,118 from May 1 to May 4. Tokyo reported 591 new infections on May 6, a relatively low tally for a Thursday. Sharing Tamura’s view, metropolitan health officials cautioned against taking the figure as a sign of a declining trajectory during the third state of emergency in the capital. They said the May 6 number largely reflected the fact that fewer tests were conducted because many hospitals were closed during the holidays. They also cited a delay in reports on new cases confirmed from public health centers during Golden Week. The officials said other numbers indicate that new infections will start rising again. More Tokyo residents are contacting consultation centers about fevers, a common symptom of COVID-19. And the rate of positive tests has also been increasing. The health officials said the situation now is similar to what occurred late last year before the third wave of infections hit the capital. The number of people who contacted consultation centers ranged from 756 to 1,170 a day in late March after the second state of emergency was lifted for Tokyo. But the daily number topped 2,000 in May. The daily average number of consultations over the week through May 4 was 2,079, surpassing 2,000 for the first time since the week through Dec. 31. A week later, on Jan. 7, the number of new COVID-19 cases hit a record 2,520 in Tokyo. The rate of patients who tested positive for the novel coronavirus was 9.2 percent in the week through May 4, 3 percentage points higher than a week earlier. The positive test ratio also jumped when the number of new cases surged in Tokyo late last year. N501Y, a COVID-19 variant that is believed to be 30 to 90 percent more contagious than the initial strain, is fast circulating in Tokyo. An estimated 67.9 percent of patients in Tokyo who tested positive in the most recent week were infected with the variant. The ratio was 59.6 percent in the preceding week and 32.8 percent in the week before it. “We need to thoroughly implement anti-coronavirus measures to stem the spread of the highly infectious variants,” Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike said at a meeting of health experts on May 6. Central government officials said they were worried that the variants are spreading in local regions, not just in urban centers, such as Tokyo and Osaka. Between April 28 and May 4, the number of new cases per 100,000 people was 28.44 in Hokkaido, 25.49 in Gunma Prefecture, and 33.17 in Okayama Prefecture. The numbers, each 10 cases higher than in the previous week, put those prefectures in the most serious of the nation’s four-stage levels--25 per 100,000 people--in this category.

Japan has already designated India as a country where a new coronavirus variant has been spreading, as India is reporting 400,000 daily new cases. The government is expected to decide on the tougher measures at its May 7 task force meeting. Currently, Japan requires entrants from 32 countries and regions where variant strains are spreading, including India, to be tested three times. These tests are conducted before they leave their countries, when they enter Japan, and on the third day after their arrival. If all three tests are negative, the entrants are permitted to move from accommodation facilities maintained by quarantine stations to their homes or other facilities. To ensure infected passengers coming from India are detected, the government is also considering extending the three-day waiting period at designated accommodation facilities for entrants from India to six days and requiring them to take tests again on the sixth day after arrival, according to government sources. The government is also weighing similar measures against entrants from India’s neighbor Pakistan, also designated as a country suffering from a spread of variant strain infections.

At the meeting, Osaka Governor Hirofumi Yoshimura said an extension was unavoidable since the prefecture’s medical care situation had “reached its limit.” Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike also said on May 6 that an extension for the capital was necessary. After a meeting the same day of the metropolitan government panel overseeing the pandemic, Koike told reporters that the state of emergency could not be lifted as planned on May 11. She later consulted through a video conference with her counterparts in the three neighboring prefectures of Kanagawa, Saitama and Chiba. They reached a consensus that the state of emergency for the capital and pre-emergency measures for the three neighboring prefectures should be extended until May 31. Koike also said requests for a wide range of businesses to close during the state of emergency would continue. Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga and relevant Cabinet ministers were to meet on May 6 to discuss extending the state of emergency as well as whether to approve pre-emergency measures for Hokkaido and Fukuoka Prefecture, where infections have been rising in recent days. After a Cabinet meeting on May 5, Suga told reporters that a decision on continuing the state of emergency would be made this week. He added that he felt the effects from measures taken under the state of emergency to control the flow of people were beginning to appear. Some central government officials are concerned about the negative effects on the economy from requests to a wide range of businesses to close their doors during the state of emergency. A major point of the ministerial discussions will be whether to maintain the current measures or relax some requests. The third state of emergency began on April 25 and was initially set for a 17-day period. Experts and prefectural governors said the period was too short to control the spread of infections.

1,Music industry seeks return to holding concerts with audiences,['By RYO JOZUKA/ Staff Writer'],"May 6, 2021 at 15:35 JST"," Four music associations said the government's request to hold performances without audiences under the current state of emergency has struck a sour note in their industry, jeopardizing livelihoods and unfairly penalizing customers. The industry associations, representing music creators, concert event hosts and others, released a statement on May 5 asking the government to withdraw its request to hold musical events only behind closed doors. The associations said that “they have been proving that live music and concert venues are not places with a high risk of infections by their efforts and results” while taking anti-virus measures based on guidelines created by the music industry. With Tokyo, Osaka and two other prefectures currently under a third state of emergency to curb the spread of COVID-19 cases, the government is asking event operators to hold concerts, theatrical plays and sports competitions without audiences in those areas. The music associations said the loss of audiences is resulting in sharp drops in income for music artists and concert event-related staff during the pandemic. “Each one of us is proud of being involved with the creation of a music culture and supporting the music, but sadly we are reaching our limits, mentally,” the statement said. “(The government) requested it without advance notice, not providing us enough time to give out information to customers. The central and local governments are not cooperating properly, which caused a lot of trouble and a heavy burden among our customers.”",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14343291

A final decision in Hyogo will likely be made on May 7 at a meeting of the prefectural government’s task force handling the pandemic. A third state of emergency took effect April 25, but Ido said it was too early to assess the effects of the measures since 14 days had not yet passed. “I believe maintaining the measures now in place will be most effective because if they are lifted (too quickly), people might get the wrong impression that the situation is improving,” Ido said. He added that he would consult with his counterparts in Osaka and Kyoto to ensure that similar steps are in place for all three prefectures.

1,Rescue crews performing beyond the call of duty,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"May 4, 2021 at 16:30 JST"," Ambulance crews are among the unsung heroes of the pandemic, performing their essential task of rushing patients with fevers to hospitals even though many of them have yet to receive inoculations against the novel coronavirus. In short, they are putting their lives on the line in carrying out their public duties, a situation that one health expert warned could prove catastrophic if the vaccination program does not pick up speed. “If rescue workers become infected, who is going to transport patients with fevers,” said Koji Wada, a professor of public health at the International University of Health and Welfare. “The effects would be unfathomable.” Thirty-six off-duty rescue workers gathered in the basement of the Kanda Fire Station in Tokyo’s Chiyoda Ward on May 2 were among the lucky ones. Doctors and nurses dispatched by the local medical association examined each individual and gave them a jab. “I have been constantly worried about the risk of infection because I transport several patients running fevers every day, and have been doing so for a while,” said a 37-year-old rescue medic after getting inoculated. “This will give me peace of mind.” The man explained that he always dons protective clothing and a face mask while working, but there have been instances of patients and family members not taking any precautions. “The inside of the ambulance is cramped, so I was concerned,” he added. Rescue workers are among front line health care professionals designated as the first group to receive vaccinations. An estimated 153,000 rescue workers around Japan have to be vaccinated in total, according to the Fire and Disaster Management Agency. Some local fire departments have no idea when the program will start. The 3,000 or so rescue workers for the Yokohama Fire Department also are anxiously waiting for vaccinations, but no timetable has been set. “Hospitals apparently need more time to prepare,” said an official in charge of the vaccinations. Vaccinations for the Tokyo Fire Department began in late April, but so far only a few fire stations have been covered. With many doctors, nurses and other health care professionals still waiting for jabs, inoculations of rescue workers and those at quarantine stations will likely continue at a slow pace. This, say some experts, is due to the central government's mishandling of priorities to ensure all health care workers on the front line of the crisis are vaccinated.

Hokkaido Governor Naomichi Suzuki and Sapporo Mayor Katsuhiro Akimoto held an emergency meeting on May 3 and agreed to ask the central government for pre-emergency “manbo” measures for the city. Sapporo confirmed a record 246 new infection cases on May 2, as well as five deaths. It was the first time the daily infection tally exceeded 200 in the city. The new infection count for May 3, a national holiday, was 88. “Manbo is the best card we can play at this moment,” Suzuki said. The formal request will be made on May 5, the day the Hokkaido-Sapporo Marathon Festival 2021, an Olympic rehearsal event, is scheduled to run. The decision by Olympic organizers not to call off the event has drawn intense criticism from residents in the city. Shuji Miura, a 55-year-old manager of a cafe located along the route, said he has complied with the Hokkaido government’s requests for eateries in Sapporo to close by 9 p.m. from April 27 to May 11. “We are doing what we can to contain the coronavirus,” he said. “But it will be completely useless if they hold the rehearsal event before we see any result.” A 47-year-old woman who runs a confectionary shop in Sapporo’s Susukino nightlife district expressed indignation toward the organizers. “I can’t come up with any good reason why they have to push it through when the infection numbers are rising this much,” she said. Under the new measures, bars and restaurants will likely be asked to close earlier, at 8 p.m. Sapporo officials have also decided to close public facilities and cancel certain events for the remainder of the Golden Week holidays to prevent the health care system from collapsing. Mayor Akimoto underscored the severity of the situation at a news conference on May 2. “Infections are rapidly spreading, and we are in a critical situation,” he said. He urged local residents, “Please refrain as much as possible from going outdoors.” To people outside of Sapporo, he said, “Please try as hard as possible not to come to Sapporo.” However, hundreds of participants are expected to enter Sapporo for the pre-Olympic event, even though the Tokyo Olympic organizing committee and local officials earlier decided to ban 2,500 citizens from participating. About 120 “elite” runners, including Japanese national team members, are billed to compete in a half-marathon, as well as 50 or so top runners in a 10-km race, both using the Olympic marathon course. Some of the runners are expected to come from overseas. Yasuo Mori, a top official of the Tokyo Organizing Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games, said the rehearsal event “is extremely important to get ready to operate the (Olympic marathons).” Organizers, including Hokkaido and Sapporo officials, will test security and anti-virus measures using the Olympic course, which starts and ends at Sapporo Odori Park. Local police will also do a necessary walk-through. They are expected to be dispatched to control crowds, enforce traffic rules and check their anti-terrorism measures. The Olympic marathon course runs through famous sightseeing spots in the city, such as the Susukino district and the campus of Hokkaido University. Organizers have insisted that a rehearsal event is necessary because it is an urban setting with heavy traffic of people and vehicles. But what if no spectators show up for the pre-Olympic event? The area surrounding Sapporo Odori Park will be closed off during the trial runs. “Anti-virus measures need to be made based on guidelines regarding spectators,” Akimoto said on April 28. “So we cannot test that part at the (rehearsal event).” He also urged residents to refrain from watching the test marathon along the route. “Please view it on TV at home,” he said. For the Olympic marathons in August, citizen volunteers will be called up to stand along the route with signs warning the public to keep a safe distance from each other to lower the risk of virus infection. However, Olympic organizers have not decided on whether any spectators will be allowed at events at the Games. Asked late last month if the Olympics should be held in the first place, Akimoto declined to answer. But he said it is “extremely important” that the organizers’ anti-virus measures, such as the number of allowed spectators, to hold the Games safely “are convincing to the public and local residents.” A 24-year-old female company employee who came to see Odori Park, where construction for the Olympics are under way, appeared unconvinced. “Fewer and fewer people are interested in the Olympics because of the pandemic,” she said. The Olympics will likely be held “when people around the world have a lot of reservations about cheering for the athletes,” she said. “I feel sorry for the athletes.” (This article was written by Kaede Sano, Ryuzo Nakano, Takuya Kado and Noboru Okada.)",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14342247

The request to the Japanese Nursing Association (JNA) by the Tokyo Olympic organizing committee met with a swift response. The Japan Federation of Medical Worker’s Unions (Iroren) released a statement April 30 demanding an immediate review of the request. The Aichi prefectural federation of unions for those in the medical and elderly care sectors (Aichiken Iroren) tweeted its opposition to the request on April 26 and the hashtag had received more than 240,000 tweets by April 30. Susumu Morita, Iroren secretary-general, issued a statement casting doubt on the likelihood of the health crisis being brought under control by the start of the Tokyo Olympics. “I feel strong anger at the persistence to hold the Olympics, even if that means sacrificing the lives and health of patients and nurses,” the statement said. On its own Twitter account, Aichiken Iroren tweeted, “Nurses should be dispatched to areas with insufficient nurses to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic.” Another tweet called for more measures to deal with the pandemic rather than go ahead with the Olympics. Prefectural federation officials said many medical institutions in Aichi Prefecture face a nursing shortage due to the fact that each COVID-19 patient with serious symptoms requires more intensive care from the staff. In addition, a number of nurses who contracted the novel coronavirus during the course of their work decided to quit, further exacerbating the situation. Officials said some nurses are being asked to work seven or eight night shifts a month, which is much higher than public guidelines. A number of expectant nurses have also been asked to take the night shift. “The feeling among those at the front lines is that losing even a single staff member would be disastrous,” said Ayako Yano, a prefectural federation official. “Simply presenting a 500 figure shows they have no idea what the actual situation is like. Those at the front lines are furious.” Toshiko Fukui, the JNA president, met with Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga on April 30. She later told reporters, “If they are going to go ahead with (the Tokyo Olympics), every effort should be made from now toward that goal.”",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14341415

0,Japan’s summer hand fans get a pandemic twist in mask mashup,['By TAKASHI NAKAJIMA/ Senior Staff Writer'],"May 1, 2021 at 08:00 JST"," HIGASHI-OSAKA, Osaka Prefecture--Could creating more user-friendly COVID-19 protection than masks that must be endlessly doffed and donned be as simple as sticking a mask on a Japanese handheld summer fan? Local plastics processing firm Kawakita here thinks so. The company is selling a mashup of a nonwoven fabric face mask and a fan it calls the Masukucchi, putting a pandemic twist on the fans that are ubiquitous during summer in Japan. The mask slips into a plastic pocket on the warped fan. That way, the mask won't come into contact with surfaces so people who use the fans can put them down on tables when eating without worrying about picking up the virus, Kawakita said. Users can also hang the fans around their necks, it added. By holding the fans over their mouths, users can block potentially infectious droplets of saliva from escaping and spreading the virus, the company said. You can quickly stick a fan in front of your mouth, Kawakita said, helping reduce the risk of novel coronavirus infection through droplets of stray saliva. The company also touts the fan over see-through plastic face shields, saying that they can steam up, but that's not an issue with the Masukucchi. Though the surgical mask on the fan must sometimes be replaced, the fan can be washed and used repeatedly. Kawakita started selling them online for 550 yen ($5.05) after tax on April 15. IDEA CAME FROM VISITOR The company got the idea to make the fans from a visitor to their office in December last year. The man in his 60s, who said he was an adviser for an insurance company, showed them a trial product, said Ichiro Kawakita, 54, Kawakita's third-generation president. The man from Tsu in Mie Prefecture said he wanted to “help restaurants struggling with plummeting sales due to the coronavirus crisis” and asked Kawakita to help him put them in production. Kawakita's president, who had heard his favorite eatery was in the same boat, readily accepted. Though the man's prototype was far from ready to go, Kawakita felt he had to hurry with development given the urgent situation for restaurants and contacted other business operators around Higashi-Osaka for help. The handle of a normal handheld fan was adopted and transparent plastic was selected to make the fan's body. Development finished in February this year. “The experience made me reconfirm that manufacturing is a great job to bring ideas into shape,” Kawakita said.

0,Tokyoites under emergency still searching for places to drink,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"April 30, 2021 at 17:24 JST"," Bars and restaurants outside of Tokyo have stopped serving alcohol to prevent imbibers in the capital from fleeing their state of emergency, crossing borders to grab some drinks, and potentially spreading the novel coronavirus. But not all businesses have followed suit. And many are receiving free advertising about the availability of alcohol in those establishments. Under the COVID-19 state of emergency in Tokyo, drinking places have halted sales of booze to cut down on foot traffic, particularly in entertainment districts, and halt the latest surge in novel coronavirus infections. The neighboring prefectures of Kanagawa, Saitama and Chiba are only covered by pre-emergency measures, and they had been asking bars and restaurants to close early. But from April 28, a total of 36 municipalities in the three prefectures asked businesses to also refrain from serving alcohol in a bid to prevent throngs of Tokyoites from venturing across prefectural borders in search of a drink. After the state of emergency took effect in the capital on April 25, one popular destination for drinkers was the Kanagawa Prefecture city of Kawasaki, located across the Tamagawa river from Tokyo’s Ota Ward. But on the evening of April 28, many bars and restaurants near JR Kawasaki Station had posted signs saying alcohol was not being served. Others have closed down for the duration of the pre-emergency measures. The manager of one restaurant that complied with the prefectural government request to stop serving alcohol and close at 8 p.m. pointed to another establishment across the road. The “izakaya” Japanese-style pub not only was still open, but it was also serving alcohol. Six groups were in that izakaya, and customers in five of the groups were not wearing face masks. The restaurant manager said sales on April 28 were only a third of the take the previous day. “Customers are clearly going to places that serve alcohol,” the manager said. A man in his 40s who drank at the izakaya with two colleagues said he worked near JR Kamata Station in Ota Ward and he could not think of a bar or restaurant near that station where he could get a drink. “Kawasaki is a large place, so I thought there had to be a place that served alcohol,” he said, adding that he was aware Kanagawa Prefecture was covered by pre-emergency measures. He and his colleagues took the train for one stop to quench their thirsts. “We wore face masks when we were talking, and I drank with people I work with every day,” the man said. “People who want to drink will do so after finding an open bar.” A 26-year-old company employee was taking photos with his smartphone of izakaya open for business near Kawasaki Station. “I was informing friends living in Tokyo what places were still open at this time of night,” the man said. While he had avoided drinking parties last year, he said he has attended about two such sessions every month this year. “We refrained for over a year, so I believe from now it is all about self-responsibility,” he said. UNITY IN KAWAGUCHI Local government requests are being followed in Kawaguchi in Saitama Prefecture. The city is located across the Arakawa river from Tokyo’s Akabane, long known for its many bars where customers could get a buzz for 1,000 yen ($9). One “yakitori” grilled chicken place in Kawaguchi that has been in business for more than three decades had about 30 customers on April 27. The following night, after the no-booze rule took effect, only six customers were seated at the counter. And they were drinking non-alcoholic beer or oolong tea with their chicken. Other establishments in the area posted signs saying they were either closing or not serving alcohol from April 28. The 64-year-old owner of the yakitori restaurant said: “Many of the businesses here have a long history, so there is unity. We obey the rules because we are aware others are watching.” The 44-year-old owner of a Kawaguchi izakaya that opened in May 2020 had to tell five groups of young potential customers that his place was not serving alcohol. After the second state of emergency for Saitama Prefecture was lifted, the izakaya’s 40 or so seats were filled every day between late March and early April. On April 26 and 27, when the izakaya closed its doors at 8 p.m., about 30 customers showed up each day, with many saying it might be their last chance to drink there. On April 28, the izakaya had only two customers. The owner said: “Kawaguchi may not have an image as ‘a place to go for drinks.’ I felt ‘not again’ just after sales began picking up. I had hoped for more customers during the Golden Week of national holidays, but this puts me in a bind.” (This article was written by Keita Yamaguchi and Yusuke Nagano.)",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14340690

0,Pandemic hitting women harder due to lack of gender equality,['By SAWA OKABAYASHI/ Staff Writer'],"April 30, 2021 at 15:15 JST"," From losing their jobs and struggling to find work to becoming victims of domestic violence and even taking their own lives, women are disproportionately bearing the brunt of the novel coronavirus pandemic, research shows. According to a Cabinet Office report released on April 28, the average number of female non-regular workers in 2020 dropped by 500,000 from the previous year. The average number of male non-regular workers in 2020, though, was only 260,000 less than the year before. The Cabinet Office had set up a research group to study how women are being affected by the pandemic and what challenges they face. The report presents eye-popping statistics that reveal how existing societal problems that unequally affect women have become much more severe amid the ongoing health crisis. Sawako Shirahase, a sociology professor at the University of Tokyo who chaired the research group, said at a news conference that the results reflect how serious the gender inequality gap is in Japan. She urged the government to establish new policies that adopt gender perspectives. “It is not that the measures are needed because of the pandemic,” she said. “There is no way (for women) to survive if the gap widens even further.” Her group interviewed civil support organizations and analyzed statistical data to examine the issue across four categories: employment and the economy, violence against women, health, and unpaid work such as housework and raising children. The report said the nearly two-fold gap between men and women emerged in the non-regular workers' job loss figures because the restaurant, hospitality and service industries--all of which have a high ratio of female workers--are being hit particularly hard in the pandemic. The report's analysis of central government data shows women with children who are elementary school age or younger had struggled harder to find work than other women when schools were shut down due to the pandemic around April 2020. The unemployment rate for single mothers significantly rose in the period from July to September last year, the group also found. It said the underlying reason is that Japan’s social structure lacks gender equality. The group said it is necessary to change the perception that “men are the breadwinners” and “what women earn is an assist to household finances.” The country’s social security and tax systems were designed based on that idea, the group said. It cited a study that showed female non-regular workers in dual-income households earn 20 percent of the household income while female regular workers earn 40 percent. The group said it is vital for women to be financially independent amid grim statistics on suicide and abuse. The number of men who committed suicide in 2020 was about 14,000, which was 23 fewer than the previous year. By comparison, 7,000 women killed themselves in 2020, 935 more than the previous year. The number of housewives, pensioners and high school students who committed suicide increased, the group said. The report mentioned instances where women have hesitated to escape from their partners in domestic abuse cases because they rely on the abusers’ income. The number of consultations on domestic violence from April 2020 to February this year was more than 170,000, 1.5 times more than the same time the previous year. The number of consultations a support center for victims of sexual crime and sexual violence received between April and September of 2020 increased 1.2 times from the previous year.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14340607

Metropolitan government officials confirmed 1,027 new cases, bringing the daily average for the week until April 29 to 782.1, a 14.3 percent increase over the average for the previous week. New COVID-19 cases began surging in Tokyo from the end of last year during the third wave of infections. The daily figure hit a record high 2,520 on Jan. 7, followed by two days each with more than 2,000 new infections. The number of cases then began declining, and on Jan. 28, 1,065 cases were reported, the last time the capital confirmed more than 1,000 new infections. The daily figures dropped to levels between 100 and 400 by late February. However, the flow of pedestrian traffic in Tokyo began picking up again, likely because people became weary of anti-virus measures, such as refraining from outings or meals with friends and colleagues. That led to another steady increase in cases from about March 10. On April 7, Tokyo reported 555 new cases, surpassing 500 for the first time since Feb. 6. The recent surge in Tokyo has been fueled by the N501Y variant strain that had earlier spread rapidly in the Kansai region of western Japan. According to tests conducted by the Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Public Health, 59.6 percent of patients in the capital tested until April 25 were infected with the N501Y strain. The figure for the previous week was 32.8 percent and 37.8 percent two weeks earlier, showing that variant strain is quickly becoming the main one in Tokyo. The variant is said to have a much higher effective reproduction number, which indicates the average number of people a single COVID-19 patient will infect. The N501Y strain had a 1.43-fold to 1.9-fold higher figure than the original strain. The mutant strain is also more likely to cause serious symptoms among infected young people. Health experts urged caution because all age brackets were at risk. Infection clusters of the variant strain have been found at Tokyo day care centers and elementary schools, in addition to hospitals and facilities for senior citizens.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14340187
0,Large infection risk found in 30% of asymptomatic virus patients,['By YUMI NAKAYAMA/ Staff Writer'],"April 29, 2021 at 16:12 JST"," Potentially big spreaders of the novel coronavirus can be the people least suspected of carrying the contagion, a recent study showed. In a “social testing” project that started in October 2020, Tokyo’s Setagaya Ward office tested residents and workers at care facilities and related businesses for elderly and disabled people. All 21,710 people tested as of April 27 showed no signs of COVID-19 symptoms, but 117 were in fact infected with the novel coronavirus. Samples are analyzed under an amplification process to detect the virus. Larger quantities of the virus, which increase the risk of infecting others, require less amplification for detection. Hiroshi Nishihara, a professor at Keio University Hospital Clinical and Translational Research Center, analyzed the data under commission from the ward office. He said he focused on the Ct value, which indicates how many times amplification was repeated to confirm the presence of the virus. Nishihara said the amplification value was small in 27 of 78 positive cases detected over a four-month period. That means 30 percent of the asymptomatic patients carried large quantities of the virus and a greater danger of infecting others. “It is urgent to find people with certainty who are at high risk of spreading the infection,” Nishihara said. The ward mayor, Nobuto Hosaka, released the data from the study on April 28. “It is important to know not only the result—positive or negative—but also the strength of infection,” Hosaka said. “The time has come to focus on the Ct value and think about effective measures.” The ward office also started “pool testing” project on April 19, in which five specimens are tested together, and the ones with a “positive” result are then individually tested. The project is intended to save time, reagent volume and costs, the ward said. “The biggest infection risk is via saliva when people talk and eat without wearing a mask,” Nishihara said. “A pool polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test that uses saliva is effective.” The ward office plans to continue its study until September. Based on the results, the ward office plans to submit a proposal to the central government on ways to contain the virus while maintaining socio-economic activities.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14340142

Bach was speaking at the start of a meeting with Tokyo 2020 organisers to finalise the second edition of the ""playbooks"" of rules for the Summer Games, with less than three months to go and Japan battling a surge of coronavirus cases. Parts of Japan including the capital were put under another state of emergency at the weekend, and most of the Japanese public think the Games, postponed from 2020 because of the pandemic, should be cancelled or postponed again. The emergency, which is due to last until May 11, requires restaurants and bars serving alcohol to close along with large stores, cinemas and other commercial facilities, asks firms to let staff work from home, and excludes spectators from big sports events. Speaking by video link, Bach told organisers, including Tokyo 2020 President Seiko Hashimoto, that he understood the move, and that compliance with the playbooks, which lay out a number of anti-infection measures, would be strictly enforced. ""The IOC is fully committed to the successful and safe delivery of the Olympic and Paralympic Games,"" he said. An earlier edition of the rules, which came out in February, banned singing and chanting during events and mandated that event participants wear masks at all times except when sleeping, eating or outdoors. Spectators from overseas have already been excluded, but more than 10,000 athletes, coaches and their entourages are expected in July. Athletes and coaches will undergo virus testing on a daily basis, according to media reports. Kyodo news agency said officials who come into close contact with athletes will also need to be tested every day. A decision on the number of domestic spectators allowed into venues may not come until June. Though Japan has not suffered as badly from COVID-19 as many other countries, the infection rate has risen back to levels not seen since January, and more and more are from variant strains.

Shortly past 6 p.m. on April 26, the first weekday since Japan’s third state of emergency was issued for the capital as well as Osaka, Hyogo and Kyoto prefectures, most pedestrians in suits in the area appeared to be headed to JR Shinbashi Station, rather than stopping at a bar. “The crowds are only around half the level of last week,” said a restaurant employee in her 20s with a sigh, as she was trying to convince customers passing by on the street to come in. “And they're all salarymen going home.” Establishments that serve alcohol are being asked to close in areas covered by the emergency declaration. Nearly half the bars and restaurants around Shinbashi Station were operating on April 26 with signs reading, “We’re open without serving alcohol.” But many other establishments put up notices to inform customers that they will remain closed until May 11, when the current state of emergency is due to end. The area, known as a nightlife heaven for businessmen, was darker than usual as many outlets turned off the lights. Among establishments operating that day, one eatery offering grilled entrails taped over the alcoholic drinks on its menu out front. Still, dozens of people dropped by. But they left after the manager of the restaurant told them that it wasn't serving alcohol. Before the emergency declaration, 80 percent of the eatery's seats were full by late afternoon, but they were empty on the evening of April 26. “The ‘ban on alcohol’ has dealt the heaviest blow to our operations,” said its manager, in his 30s, who has complied with authorities’ requests to close early to contain the pandemic. Meanwhile, some businessmen were seen drinking canned “chuhai,” shochu-based alcoholic beverages, in the square in front of the station. A man in his 50s and another in his 60s said they would drink canned chuhai for about half an hour on the streets or at a park after their day’s work to let off steam. They said the drinking sessions had been their favorite pastime since before the pandemic started. But they gave up drinking openly in public after learning about news reports calling on people to refrain from drinking in the streets. Emptying canned chuhai wrapped in cooler covers, the men lamented the recent tendency of people to bash others for their behavior. The Asahi Shimbun used smartphone location data by Softbank Group Corp. affiliate Agoop Corp. to analyze foot traffic around Shinbashi Station between 3 p.m. and 4 p.m. on the first Sundays after the first, second and third states of emergency were issued. The results showed pedestrian traffic on April 25 was about 2.3 times greater than on April 12, 2020, when the first emergency declaration was in place, and roughly 1.1 times the level on Jan. 10, when the second state of emergency was in effect.

Japan imposed a third state of emergency in its major population centers on Sunday, as the country attempts to combat a fourth wave of infections with just 87 days remaining until the scheduled start of the Games. The Defense Ministry tweeted it had been asked by Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga to set up the Tokyo vaccination center by May 24 with plans for it to operate for three months. The facility will service residents in the capital and the surrounding prefectures of Saitama, Chiba, and Kanagawa. Local media reported the government planned to use Moderna Inc.'s vaccine to inoculate about 10,000 people each day at the center. However, Chief Cabinet Secretary Katsunobu Kato said those decisions had not yet been made. Meanwhile, Toyota City in central Japan said it was setting up vaccination centers with the help of Toyota Motor Corp. The carmaker will offer up about 450 staff and four sites to start operations on May 30, city officials said in a statement. Japan began vaccinating its sizable elderly population this month but only about 1.5% of the country's entire 126 million population has been inoculated, according to a Reuters tracker. Officials have so far been dependent on limited imported doses of Pfizer Inc.'s vaccine, but vaccine minister Taro Kono has said he expects the program to pick up in May when Pfizer shipments are due to accelerate.

Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike said on April 26 that the patient is a woman in her 80s, who was discharged from a hospital earlier this month. The double-mutant strain contains mutations discovered in two other versions of the coronavirus. One mutation makes the virus highly contagious while the other is believed to make the virus more resistant to vaccines. Koike said the discovery of the double mutant will add to the capital’s fight against the coronavirus, as it struggles to grapple with another variant strain first discovered in Britain last year. “It is terrifying that much about the double mutant is still not known,” she said. “This year, we are fighting something that is largely unknown.” Twenty-one cases of the double mutant have been detected in Japan to date, according to the central government. All the cases except for the Tokyo woman were found during checks of travelers at airports. Chief Cabinet Secretary Katsunobu Kato said the same day that the central government will take any measures necessary against the double mutant, including bolstering steps to keep the virus at bay and monitoring the spread of the variants as the health ministry works to analyze them.

Although the nation’s death rate during the pandemic is low compared with those in hard-hit Western countries, Japan is way behind other countries in East Asia and the Pacific region in containing the virus, according to the World Health Organization. Japan’s accumulative death toll reached 10,025 on April 26, including deaths of patients who were aboard a cruise ship that docked off Yokohama early last year when the virus started to spread in the country, according to data compiled by The Asahi Shimbun. Of the 10,025, about 6,500 have died since January, when the country was in the grip of the third wave of infections. Japan is now struggling to stem the fourth wave of new cases, particularly in densely populated areas, such as Tokyo and Osaka, Hyogo and Kyoto prefectures, which have been placed under a 17-day state of emergency since April 25. Other prefectures are also reporting surges in new infections. The latest wave has been driven by variant COVID-19 strains, particularly one first reported in Britain, which are more contagious and potentially more deadly. The capital accounted for the largest number of fatalities, at 1,876, followed by 1,376 in Osaka Prefecture, 843 in Hokkaido, 812 in Kanagawa Prefecture and 739 in Saitama Prefecture. More than 95 percent of the deaths were patients in their 60s or older, according to health ministry data as of April 21. Patients in their 70s accounted for 24 percent of the deaths, while the ratio was 65 percent for those in their 80s. Japan’s first death from COVID-19 was reported on Feb. 13, 2020. Under the central government’s first state of emergency in April and May last year, the daily death toll ranged from 10 to 20. But fatalities began climbing in the summer with the second wave in new infections. The daily death toll hit a record 121 on Feb. 20, when the capital and several other prefectures with large cities were covered by the second state of emergency. Although fatalities declined for a while after the state of emergency was lifted, the death toll rebounded and topped 50 for three straight days from April 23. Data compiled by the WHO as of April 26 showed that Japan’s fatalities per 100,000 people was 7.9, ranking 137th among 236 countries and territories whose figures were made available. Japan’s ranking is not bad, given that 42 countries and territories, including the United States and many European nations, reported more than 100 fatalities per 100,000 people, health experts said. “As Japan’s share of senior citizens is the largest in the world, its ratio of fatalities is relatively low, compared with many Western countries that have similarly large populations of elderly people,” Mitsuyoshi Urashima, a professor of preventive medicine at Jikei University School of Medicine, said. But Japan’s record is eclipsed by countries in East Asia and the Pacific region. The WHO data showed that the number of deaths per 100,000 people was 0.5 for both New Zealand and Singapore, 0.3 for China and 0.2 for Thailand. These countries are known to have aggressively carried out mass diagnostic tests to quickly identify infected individuals within their borders and at entry points and separate them from the healthy population. “Japan should learn from those countries to contain the disease,” Urashima said.

It was the first weekday since the central government declared the emergency for the capital, as well as Osaka, Hyogo and Kyoto prefectures on April 25, which lasts until May 11. The government is asking companies to reduce the number of employees reporting to work by 70 percent, but it is unlikely to achieve the target anytime soon. Beginning around 8 a.m., slews of people clad in face masks could be seen coming and going continuously at a crossing in front of JR Tokyo Station. A Tokyo Olympics countdown clock installed in the area read 88 days and 12 hours remained before the Opening Ceremony. “Trains were crowded as usual,” said a man in his 40s who took a train on the Utsunomiya Line before quickly striding across the crosswalk. “I don't think the state of emergency is effective anymore.” A security guard at a nearby building said, “Even under the emergency declaration, I can’t see any changes (in the volume of foot traffic).” A man reading a book at a nearby bench before commuting to work said he was surprised at the big difference in people’s attitudes compared to when Japan's first state of emergency was declared a year ago. “At that time, I was able to find a seat on a train on the normally overcrowded Yamanote Line,” said the 52-year-old financial company worker. “But it was crowded this morning. It's totally different from a year ago.” Last spring he worked remotely once or twice a week as his company was promoting teleworking. But he said now he feels the company thinks it is enough to just have minimal teleworking among its workforce. “People are getting used to the novel coronavirus and the state of emergency,” he said. “I think the central government has to enforce its anti-virus measures to some extent to reduce the burden on the health care system.” Commuters in suits and school uniforms were also seen filling up Osaka’s Umeda district on the morning of April 26. “Foot traffic was slightly smaller early in the morning, but began gradually increasing from 7 a.m.,” said Takafumi Yamanaka, who sweeps areas around Hankyu Corp.’s Osaka Umeda Station from 5 a.m. Yamanaka, 60, who has observed the flow of people in front of the station over the past five years or so, said he noticed a difference from the first state of emergency. “The area was mostly deserted last April as all office buildings around here were closed,” he said. “I don’t think the latest state of emergency will be as effective as the first.” Another man, 55, who took a train on Hankyu’s Kyoto Line to the Umeda district from Takatsuki, Osaka Prefecture, said, “I was expecting fewer people out and about, but the size of crowds appears to be the same as before the emergency declaration.” The trains were also crowded as usual, he added. “Foot traffic plunged when the first state of emergency was issued,” he said. “I wonder if people have already gotten used to the emergency declaration.” He said he is creating a schedule for remote working shifts at his company. A university sophomore, 19, who lives in Osaka Prefecture, changed trains at Umeda to commute to her campus in Kobe. She said last April she could take all her classes remotely, but this time she has to attend half on campus. “The bus was overcrowded this morning,” she said. “I want the university to hold all its classes remotely until the pandemic is brought under control.” To avoid riding the bus as much as possible, she has recently been walking up a hill on her way to the campus, she said.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14338045

According to officials, a joint government office complex located in the central Otemachi district in Tokyo’s Chiyoda Ward would be used to vaccinate residents and commuters in the capital. A similar plan for Osaka is also being discussed, the officials said. Local governments are facing shortages of health care workers who can administer the shots, so certified doctors and nurses of the Self-Defense Forces will take over the task at the state-run vaccination sites, according to the plan. Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga said in the Lower House on April 12 that he would dispatch SDF members to resolve the shortage of medical staff on the local level. The vaccination program targeting about 4.8 million health care workers began on Feb. 17, while people 65 and older started receiving the shots on April 12. The vaccines are administered by municipal governments after prefectural governments make arrangements under the guidance of the central government. However, the Suga government has come under criticism for the slow pace of vaccinations, compared with those in other developed countries. “The central government wants to complete the two-dose vaccinations of elderly people by the end of July,” Suga said at an April 23 news conference. Health minister Norihisa Tamura was asked about that time frame during a TV program on April 25. “It is a possibility that (people under 65) can receive the vaccine concurrently if there are vaccine supplies,” Tamura said. Local governments have also expressed concerns about the availability of the vaccines for their populations. The central government is expected to send 18 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines, enough to inoculate 9 million people, to local governments over the two weeks starting from May 10. By the end of June, the central government is expected to have delivered a total of 105.8 million doses, enough for 50 million people. That includes two doses for each of the 36 million people who are 65 or older.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14337935

Department stores began operating in a strictly limited capacity, numerous restaurants opened but were not allowed to sell alcohol, while most museums and cultural facilities, along with cinema complexes, shut their doors. Many amusement parks also decided to temporarily close, but sports events will be held without spectators in principle. Department store operators closed all of their floors to customers, opting to only open their food halls and sections selling items such as cosmetics and women’s clothing. The emergency is initially scheduled to last through May 11, although many health experts warned it will likely have to be extended. In addition to the capital, Osaka, Kyoto and Hyogo prefectures are covered by the emergency curbs. Authorities in these areas are requesting more commercial facilities to close during the period due to the deepening health crisis brought on by novel coronavirus variants. In contrast with department stores, supermarkets and convenience stores in the targeted areas will remain open as usual and sell alcohol. The emergency comes as Japan prepares for the Golden Week holiday period at the end of this month. It is traditionally a time when hordes of people return to their hometowns or take vacations. In the food service industry, many establishments were subject to the closure request by authorities if they serve alcohol. While many “izakaya” Japanese-style pubs shut down, family restaurants and “gyudon” beef bowl chains will remain open until 8 p.m., but they are not permitted to sell alcohol. Performances scheduled for the National Theater of Japan, the National Engei Hall and Kabukiza theater in the capital were all canceled for the duration of the emergency. Operators of cinema complexes such as TOHO, Shochiku and Aeon, also closed their theaters in Tokyo and the three other prefectures. But four major theaters for vaudeville performers in Tokyo, including the Asakusa Engei Hall, will remain open by limiting audiences to half of capacity. Although many major amusement parks decided on temporary closure, Tokyo Disneyland and Tokyo Disney Sea in Chiba Prefecture will stay open. Both facilities will suspend sales of alcoholic drinks from April 28. Japanese professional baseball authorities decided April 24 that games scheduled for the four prefectures will be held behind closed doors during the emergency period. But games for April 25 will be held with spectators because tickets have been sold. Denying entry to the stadium at such a short notice would cause pandemonium, officials said.

0,Emergency may well extend beyond May 11 deadline,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"April 24, 2021 at 15:15 JST"," Health experts are already casting doubt on the likely effectiveness of a new state of emergency for four prefectures that begins April 25, saying the duration is too short to gauge whether the curbs will have worked when the steps are due to be lifted. Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga stressed that the latest measures included a package intended to deal with the novel coronavirus pandemic in a strong and focused manner centered on the Golden Week holiday period that kicks off at the end of April. Health professionals weighed in quickly after Suga's April 23 announcement, saying the 17 days allotted to the emergency period were insufficient. They warned against lifting the steps if the hospital care situation has not improved by the time the curbs expire. Tokyo and the three western Japan prefectures of Osaka, Hyogo and Kyoto will be covered by the announcement. Osaka Governor Hirofumi Yoshimura was among those who grumbled about the short duration even though he had balked earlier at imposing such steps. “Even by May 11 (when the state of emergency is scheduled to end) the hospital care situation in Osaka will still be very tight,” Yoshimura said. Osaka prefectural authorities had called for the measures to remain in place for at least three or four weeks. “The consensus is that there will be no unconditional lifting of the state of emergency on May 11,” Shigeru Omi, the chairman of the government panel of experts dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic, told reporters April 23 after the government approved the state of emergency. However, he said an extension of the period was possible if the situation in the four prefectures had not improved to the second most serious stage 3 in terms of the risk of spreading of infections. Other experts also noted that it normally takes about two weeks for the effects of infection prevention measures to show up. While there are stronger measures involving requests to close business in a wide range of sectors, the current surge in new infections is also being blamed on mutant strains of the coronavirus. For this reason, it remains to be seen if the 17-day period will be sufficient to restrain new cases. Another member of the government panel said reaching stage 3 was critical but that the affected prefectures also had to show signs the situation was further improving to stage 2. In the case of Tokyo, which has been recording in excess of 700 new cases daily, that would mean reducing the number of new cases first to under 500 and eventually to below 100. “But the number of new cases will likely continue to increase over the next two weeks or so (during Golden Week), making it difficult to bring down the number under 500 by May 11,” the member said, adding it would likely take a month before the effects emerged. Another member said it would be difficult to accurately gauge the infection situation over Golden Week because the number of tests given would decrease. “Results will not emerge just because the declaration was issued,” said Mitsuyoshi Urashima, a professor of preventive medicine at Jikei University School of Medicine in Tokyo. “If there is no improvement, the government’s measures will be labeled as ineffective, and that could badly tarnish trust in the government.” He called on the government to release data that serves as the scientific basis for the measures and also prepare a scenario in case the new measures prove ineffective.

The state of emergency, which will remain in place from April 25 until May 11, covers Tokyo and three western Japan prefectures of Osaka, Hyogo and Kyoto. Establishments that serve alcohol and operate karaoke equipment will be asked to close their doors during the period along with commercial facilities with a floor space exceeding 1,000 square meters. In addition, the government also approved pre-emergency measures for Ehime Prefecture on Shikoku. The latest state of emergency follows ones issued in April 2020 and January. The pre-emergency measures for Miyagi and Okinawa prefectures will also remain in place until May 11 beyond the original deadline of May 5. “By implementing stiff measures over a short period of time, such as requests to close doors temporarily, we will thoroughly control the flow of people and restrain a further spread of infections,” Yasutoshi Nishimura, the state minister in charge of economic revitalization who also heads the central government’s efforts against the pandemic, said at a meeting on April 23 of experts dealing with the pandemic. In the prefectures covered by the state of emergency, restaurants that do not serve alcohol can remain open until 8 p.m. Delivery and takeout services will not be affected. Prefectures neighboring those under the state of emergency will also be asked to request that bars and restaurants in their jurisdiction also not serve alcohol. The central government will provide support to prefectural governors that distribute money to cooperating businesses. To restrain the flow of people, public transportation companies will be asked to move up the last daily runs on weekdays and to reduce the number of trains and buses operating on weekends. Schools will not close, but requests will be issued to refrain from extracurricular activities and other activities that carry a high risk of possible infection. Sporting events that draw large crowds will, in principle, only be allowed without fans in the stands. Businesses that do not obey orders to close face a maximum fine of 300,000 yen ($2,780). At his April 23 news conference, Chief Cabinet Secretary Katsunobu Kato said there were no plans to increase the amount of money distributed to establishments that close operations during the state of emergency because they serve alcohol.

0,Panel: Variants cause 89% of infections in Tokyo over week,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"April 23, 2021 at 18:19 JST"," Novel coronavirus variants accounted for nearly 90 percent of new infection cases over the most recent week in Tokyo, health experts said, fueling fears the mutated strains could cause unprecedented damage in the capital. The estimated figure was presented at an April 22 meeting of the Tokyo metropolitan government’s expert panel monitoring the spread of COVID-19. “We could face an explosive growth in infections that exceeds the third wave if not only the original strain of the virus but also mutated ones spread,” Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike said at the meeting. “We ask for the understanding and cooperation of Tokyo residents and business operators in taking thorough measures to limit the flow of people to prevent a further spread of infections at all costs.” The estimated ratio of patients who contracted virus variants was calculated using data from screening tests conducted by the Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Public Health. The results showed 32.8 percent of the new COVID-19 patients in Tokyo were infected with a variant that has the N501Y mutation, which is believed to be more contagious than the original strain, over the week until April 18. An estimated 56.5 percent of the patients contracted a variant with the E484K mutation, which is feared to reduce vaccines’ efficacy. The two variants accounted for 89 percent of the infections reported over the week, a sharp rise from the 57 percent recorded four weeks ago. According to another estimate presented at the meeting, the daily number of new COVID-19 cases in Tokyo could again top 2,000 in two weeks if infections from the N501Y variant completely replace those from other strains. The so-called effective reproduction number, which represents how many people one COVID-19 patient has infected, for the N501Y variant is estimated to be 1.43 to 1.90 times higher than that for the original strain. The daily average of new infections in Tokyo reached 684.1 for the week through April 22. That was 130.7 percent of the figure for the preceding week, up from 122.6 percent a week earlier. “A rise in cases of the variants has definitely contributed to an increase in overall infections,” Mitsuo Kaku, who heads an expert panel of the Tokyo Metropolitan Infectious Disease Surveillance Center, said after the meeting. The spread of the variants could put a bigger strain on hospitals than the level seen during the third wave of infections, which hit Japan over the year-end and New-Year holidays. The metropolitan government has secured 6,044 hospital beds for COVID-19 patients, but one expert said that may not be enough. “Tokyo could see 4,000 to 6,000 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 if the N501Y variant becomes the dominant strain,” said Masataka Inokuchi, vice chair of the Tokyo Medical Association.

0,Koike seeks to put cork in street drinking as virus cases rise,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"April 23, 2021 at 17:27 JST"," Tokyo is taking new steps to tamp down on public drinking in the streets to reduce the novel coronavirus’ spread, a move that comes just ahead of an expected third state of emergency. Metropolitan and ward government officials, together with police officers and fire department staff, will start patrolling streets in the capital’s Kabukicho district starting at 8:30 p.m. on April 23 to discourage street drinking, Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike said. “Curbing street drinking will lead to infection prevention,” Koike said at a news conference earlier in the day. “I want to strengthen measures mainly in nightlife districts.” Drinking on the street has become rife in nightlife districts and urban parks as bars and restaurants close early to comply with requests by local governments to help contain the virus’ spread. Health experts warn that just because people are taking their partying outside does not mean that they are safe. But outdoor drinking parties are expected to soon become even more rampant under the coming state of emergency, expected to be issued to Tokyo and Osaka, Hyogo and Kyoto prefectures for a 17-day period that will include the Golden Week holidays. NIGHT PARTYING SEEN AROUND TOKYO At 8 p.m. on April 22, a 44-year-old company employee washed down some fried chicken he bought at a convenience store with a can of lemon sour. He was one of about 10 men in business suits out partying, gathered around a steam locomotive statue in a square in front of JR Shinbashi Station in Tokyo’s Minato Ward. “Alcohol is the most convenient way to immediately free myself from the strain of work,” said the man, who lives in Tokyo’s Shinagawa Ward. “The place I used to go to for drinks now closes around this time, so this is the only place that (I can drink).” It was not their first station-square party. The group started having their get-togethers here three months ago, when the second state of emergency was issued in Tokyo and eateries closed early. Half an hour later that evening at Sakurada Park, not far from the station, about 20 company employees and others were out partying, holding cans of beer. They were divided into several groups and sat around the park entrance. A company employee, 27, who lives in Toshima Ward, came to the park with an acquaintance. The two men sat on a fence that separates a path and bushes to drink some canned beer together. They came to the park because the nearby eateries were either closed or full, he said. “Nothing is open at night. And I find ‘online drinking parties’ to be hollow after all,” he said. “Drinking on the street is where it’s at now because it’s getting warm.” SAFER IN TYPHOON-LIKE WINDS The health ministry has urged the public to stay away from situations with the “three Cs""--confined spaces with poor ventilation, crowded places and close-contact settings such as conversations at close range. Drinking on the street does not fall into the first category. However, a situation with only two Cs is not absent of risk. “People should be aware that it still poses a risk,” said Koji Wada, a public health professor at the International University of Health and Welfare. Whether it is inside or outdoors, people tend to take off their masks without keeping a safe distance once they start drinking alcohol. Moreover, people tend to speak louder when they are outside. The third state of emergency is expected to take effect on April 25 and eateries that serve alcohol are likely to be ordered to shut down. Wada is worried that this will “further increase street drinking.” Akiyoshi Iida, a professor of fluid mechanics at Toyohashi University of Technology, used the world’s fastest supercomputer, Fugaku, last fall to calculate the amount of airborne droplets people produce and how they spread during conversations and through other behavior. Whether talking while close together or out drinking on the street, he said the risk of spreading the virus remains the same “unless a typhoon-like wind is blowing.” When people have conversations outside, droplets travel 1.5 meters, he said.

At the same time, some government officials are concerned such a measure might lead residents of the affected prefectures to cross borders in search of a drink. That may mean a wider area of prefectures will also be asked to stop serving alcohol. Talks between the central government and four prefectures are dragging on as officials mull various proposals for the state of emergency that include more expansive virus countermeasures than previously taken. The central government plans to declare a state of emergency on April 23. The Tokyo metropolitan government and three prefectures in western Japan--Osaka, Hyogo and Kyoto--have put forward different ideas for combatting the worsening coronavirus situation. Tokyo wants all bars and restaurants to stop serving alcohol once a state of emergency is in place, sources said. Osaka prefectural officials submitted three options to the central government regarding bars and restaurants. The most severe would ask them to close their doors during the state of emergency. The other two include a similar alcohol ban to what Tokyo is proposing. The second would ask bars and restaurants to close their doors at 8 p.m. on weekdays and remain closed throughout weekends. The third asks them to close their doors at 8 p.m. every day. Tokyo metropolitan officials are considering continuing the 8 p.m. closing-time measure that is currently in place. Tokyo is also considering asking karaoke parlors, bowling alleys and video game arcades to close operations. Osaka is seeking to ask department stores, movie theaters, amusement parks and shopping centers to close, while Tokyo is aiming to target large commercial facilities of at least 1,000 square meters for closure. Both Tokyo and Osaka are considering asking public schools to suspend all extracurricular activities. But closing all schools completely is not currently under consideration. The jurisdictions also differ over how long they want the state of emergency to remain in place. While Osaka is looking at a period of three to four weeks, Tokyo has another proposal, with the state of emergency to begin either on April 25 or 26 and last until May 11 or 16. An official in the prime minister’s office said the discussions have been going slow because prefectures are proposing to target a much wider range of businesses than last time. Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike explained on the morning of April 22 that Tokyo submitted its request for a state of emergency the day before because its own health experts have warned that infections are spreading faster now due to variant strains of the coronavirus.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14335529
1,"Who’s first? Medical workers, elderly vie for scarce vaccines",['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"April 22, 2021 at 17:02 JST"," The director of a surgical clinic in Shingu, Fukuoka Prefecture, is uneasy about dispatching his staff to help with COVID-19 vaccinations. Doctors and nurses from Hayashi Hara's clinic are scheduled to work at a mass vaccination site in May, but as of April 21, none had received a shot themselves. “I am worried about the risk that they may contract the virus at the site or infect elderly people who come to receive a vaccine there,” Hara said. About 4.8 million health care workers nationwide went to the head of the line to receive a COVID-19 vaccine in February. But only 17 percent have completed the immunization process because there are too little supplies of vaccines and too many logistical challenges. The process has further frustrated those who are on the front lines of the fight against the novel coronavirus pandemic. Moreover, it has pitted medical professionals against a virus-vulnerable population, elderly people, over how to distribute the limited vaccines. Hara's clinic has set up a tent outside to conduct a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test on people who are suspected of having contracted the virus. “The ‘fourth wave’ of the pandemic is approaching Fukuoka Prefecture, too,"" Hara said. ""Our staff are working every day facing an infection risk.” The clinic was initially told that it would receive vaccines for the staff in late April. But the fridge that is supposed to store the vaccines temporarily has remained empty. Hara has tried calling the call center that the Fukuoka prefectural government set up to take questions from health care organizations about the vaccine. “But the line is busy all the time,” he said. “As long as there is no prospect that health care workers are immunized, we cannot prepare to immunize elderly people,” Hara said, urging the prefectural government to “provide more information to mitigate the concerns and confusion of medical workers at work.” Hoping to bolster the health care system, the central government started immunizing medical workers who are likely to treat COVID-19 patients in February. But the supply of vaccines did not keep up with the schedule. Then came April, when the central government promised to start immunizing the next priority group, elderly people. Not knowing what to do, prefectural officials flooded the health ministry with questions. “Many of them asked if they can use the vaccines intended for the elderly for health care workers,” a ministry official said. In response, the ministry on April 2 notified prefectural governments that, “Yes, you can.” In the city of Fukuoka, vaccinating the elderly started at 140 health care organizations on April 15. But the city government, after discussions with a local doctors’ organization, decided to divert the doses that were supposed to immunize the elderly for medical workers instead to lower the risk of the virus spreading at vaccination sites. Fukuoka Mayor Soichiro Takashima expressed his displeasure about the situation at a news conference on April 20. “It is absurd that health care workers who give vaccine shots are not immunized in the first place,” he said. Kita-Kyushu officials made the same decision. From April 19, the city has given the vaccines delivered for the elderly to 1,800 or so doctors and other medical workers who are in charge of the city’s mass vaccination program. “To carry out the vaccinations safely and securely, doctors and nurses need to have received at least the first shot of the vaccines,” a city official said. According to data collected by the central government, out of about 4.8 million health care workers, 800,500 people, or 17 percent, had received two shots of the vaccine as of April 20.

0,Suga avoids queries on claim of ample doses by September,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"April 22, 2021 at 15:46 JST"," Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga’s “trophy” from his brief trip to Washington immediately gathered rust after his return home. Commenting on an issue dominating the minds of the Japanese public, Suga told reporters on April 19 that Japan had secured enough doses of a COVID-19 vaccine to inoculate all eligible people by September. Under the central government’s definition, that would mean about 110 million people who are 16 or older. Suga said that in his 10-minute phone conversation with Pfizer Inc.’s CEO, Albert Bourla, on April 17, he asked the pharmaceutical company to provide additional vaccines to Japan. The prime minister quoted Bourla as replying that Pfizer “will pursue consultations in a rapid manner.” “I have a clear idea that the vaccines will be provided by September,” Suga said at the prime minister’s office. But since then, Suga’s remarks about the September schedule have been murky or nonexistent. He has repeatedly said, “I decline to comment,” when pressed for details about the supposed agreement with Pfizer. LOST IN TRANSLATION? Shinkun Haku, a lawmaker of the opposition Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan, questioned Suga’s earlier claim about securing the doses by September. “According to the Foreign Ministry’s website, the Pfizer CEO said the company ‘is willing to work together in close coordination with the Japanese government,’” Haku said at the Upper House plenary session on April 21. “But there was not a single word about September.” Haku noted that Bourla has positively said Pfizer is committed to provide 100 million doses--to European countries. Haku asked Suga: “Did he (Bourla) give you a definite commitment? Set the record straight, please.” Suga responded: “I made a request for additional supplies of (vaccines) so that we can provide them to eligible people by September with certainty. “The other party said it wants to pursue consultations swiftly, but out of consideration for the other party’s relations, I decline to disclose details.” He did not explain his own “September” comment. During the April 20 Lower House plenary session, another CDP lawmaker, Takashi Midorikawa, raised the possibility that Suga misinterpreted what Bourla had said. “I don’t think (Bourla) vowed to supply the vaccines,” Midorikawa said. Throughout two days of Diet proceedings, four lawmakers pressed the prime minister to clarify his remark about September. Suga said, “I decline to comment,” five times. He also seemed to pass the buck when asked about a time frame when all eligible people in Japan can receive the necessary doses and complete the vaccination process. “It depends on the plans made by local governments that carry out the (vaccinations),” Suga said. RIGHT MONTH, WRONG YEAR? Suga’s allies have not offered much help in laying out a clear schedule and overall picture of the vaccine program, which Suga has said would be a “game changer” in the yearlong pandemic. Hakubun Shimomura, chairman of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party’s Policy Research Council, on April 19 said even elderly people, a high priority group, will have to wait until next year to get the vaccine. Citing a shortage of health care workers who can administer the shots at vaccination sites, Shimomura said: “In some municipalities, it may go into next year to vaccinate even those who are 65 or older. At this rate, it will likely take until spring next year for all people to get the vaccine.” Taro Kono, a Cabinet member who was put in charge of the vaccine project, denied Shimomura’s estimate the following day. “I have not received a report from any local government that the (vaccination program) will go into next year,” he said. Vaccinations of people 65 or older started on April 12. According to the health ministry’s weekly progress report on vaccinations in all 47 prefectures, only 13,369 of the 36 million eligible elderly people had received the first of the two necessary doses of the COVID-19 vaccine as of April 18. In 21 prefectures, the number of eligible elderly people who had received the initial jab was under 100. In nine prefectures--Tochigi, Saitama, Shizuoka, Shiga, Hyogo, Shimane, Saga, Kumamoto and Oita--zero doses had been provided as of April 18. Immunization of about 4.8 million eligible health care workers started in February. As of April 16, Tokyo led the nation, with 117,683 medical workers receiving at least one shot and 63,168 completing the two-dose process. Osaka Prefecture followed, with 83,193 workers injected once and 48,792 twice. Overall in Japan, about 1.19 million health care workers have received the first dose and 718,396 have been given two shots. That means about 15 percent of eligible health care workers have completed the immunization process.

The case, which occurred in mid-April, is not unique, according to the Osaka prefectural government’s headquarters dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic. Hospitals in Osaka city are being overwhelmed by the rising number of novel coronavirus infections. Available beds for those with serious symptoms are in short supply, and patients, like the one in mid-April, often have nowhere to go.

0,Municipalities pressed to avoid wasting a single vaccine dose,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"April 19, 2021 at 17:30 JST"," Municipalities across Japan have revised their policies after coming under fire for wasting a most-precious commodity: COVID-19 vaccine doses. The central government is depending on overseas vaccines to inoculate the population against the novel coronavirus, but a constant concern is that supplies will run short. The high demand for the shots was evident in Hachioji, western Tokyo, one of the first municipalities to start inoculating elderly residents on April 12. Requests flooded the city’s website and call center immediately after Hachioji started accepting reservations for the vaccinations. On the first day of the vaccine program, 250 people who made reservations were supposed to receive their shots at a special vaccination site, but two of them failed to show up. The Pfizer vaccines must be kept at ultracold temperatures and used within six hours after they are opened and diluted. Leftover doses cannot be injected at a later date. The Hachioji city government had to throw away the doses that were prepared for the two no-shows. Although only two doses were lost, residents complained bitterly to the city government. “I can’t understand why it threw away vaccine doses since even a single shot must not be wasted,” said one resident. “What a waste,” said another. An official in charge of the city’s vaccination program expressed regret over the incident, saying the city government should have first considered inoculating health care workers using canceled doses. The official said the city plans to use leftover doses to vaccinate doctors, pharmacists and public health center officials. The city governments of Kyoto and Otsu were also forced to discard vaccine doses. When residents and employees of two facilities for elderly people were inoculated in Kyoto, some workers could not receive their scheduled shots because of sudden changes in their shifts. The city government also failed to find enough recipients for the vaccine doses it had prepared for the program. “We want to give top priority to not wasting precious vaccine doses while inoculating people in order of priority and ensuring fair distribution,” Kyoto Mayor Daisaku Kadokawa said on April 16. Kyoto city decided to ask facilities for elderly people planning to vaccinate residents and staff members to find substitute recipients in advance in case of cancellations. “We’ll ask the facilities to respond flexibly to (cancellations) by allowing those scheduled to receive doses the following day to be vaccinated a day earlier or inoculating staff at offices attached to the facilities,” said a city official. Otsu, the capital of Shiga Prefecture, set a policy of using leftover doses to vaccinate health care workers at a venue for its inoculation program to prevent waste. Four people canceled their vaccinations between April 13 and 15, but the city managed to find the same number of health care workers who could receive the shots, according to an official. “It’s difficult to secure vaccine doses as local governments are eager to get them,” Osaka Governor Hirofumi Yoshimura told reporters on April 16. “I want municipalities to use (leftover) doses at their own discretion to avoid wasting them.”",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14333476

The Gran Theater is part of the Aeon Cinema Theatus Shinsaibashi, a seven-screen multiplex that opened on the 12th floor of the Shinsaibashi Parco commercial complex on March 16. Anti-virus measures are in force throughout the multiplex to guard against the spread of COVID-19. All of the 382 seats are separated by partitions to prevent droplets from a moviegoer landing on others, and each one is equipped with armrests. The seats, doors and walls are coated with antibacterial and antiviral agents. The exclusive Gran Theater also focuses on providing privacy, offering only three rows of three electric reclining seats. The leather-covered, soft seats are roomy and comfortable, making it easy for audience members to change their posture and stretch their legs. The face and movements of the person sitting in the adjacent seat are blocked by the partition to allow each moviegoer to focus on whatever film is showing. The dividers can be lowered when family members, friends and couples sit side by side. The Gran Theater also went to great lengths to achieve perfect sound quality. It is equipped with the Dolby Atmos system that produces surround sound. Thirty-seven speakers are installed on the ceiling and walls, more than four times that of a theater of comparable size. Audience members can also experience stereoscopic sound, such as rain falling from above. Keisuke Inoue, general manager at the multiplex, said the theater offers an experience that is a cut above streaming services at home. “We want audiences to enjoy movies on a big screen with great sound quality,” said Inoue, 44. “We want to provide a movie-watching experience and memories.” The 4,000 yen ($36.40) admission price includes a craft beer or other beverage and a snack.

0,Osaka close to panic; now eyes another state of emergency,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"April 17, 2021 at 16:05 JST"," The governor of Osaka Prefecture said he may be forced to request another state of emergency as new cases of COVID-19 show no sign of dropping despite the introduction of measures just one level below such a declaration. Health experts applauded his stance. Hirofumi Yoshimura's warning came as four more prefectures, three of them neighboring Tokyo, along with Aichi in central Japan, were designated April 16 as warranting pre-emergency measures to cope with surging cases of COVID-19. Osaka Prefecture, the first to implement pre-emergency measures from April 5, has so far found that such steps are proving largely ineffective in curtailing increases in patient numbers. Rather than restraining new cases, Osaka has recorded more than 1,000 of novel coronavirus infections daily from April 13. Yoshimura, appearing April 16 on a local TV program, called on residents to refrain from unnecessary outings and work from home. “It is very important now to reduce movement by and contact between people,” he said. “Infection prevention measures taken by each individual will lead to protecting lives.” That same day, Osaka Prefecture confirmed 274 COVID-19 patients with serious symptoms, exceeding the number of hospital beds prefectural authorities had set aside for such cases. Some patients are being treated at medical institutions that were initially only supposed to handle individuals with light or medium symptoms. Osaka City Juso Hospital is one such facility, having set aside 70 beds for those with medium symptoms. Sixty-one of those are now filled and 10 or so patients have developed serious symptoms. “If the bed situation for those with medium symptoms becomes tight, more patients will be forced to rest at home or in other accommodation,” said a hospital official. “But then if those patients later require hospitalization, it will mean they have developed serious symptoms.” Overwhelmed by COVID-19 patient cases, some hospitals are being forced to limit the number of emergency patients they can accept with serious injuries and diseases. Yoshimura pledged to closely monitor COVID-19 figures for the week from April 19 and said that if the pre-emergency steps are still proving insufficient he will ask the central government to again declare a state of emergency for his jurisdiction. Hiroshi Nishiura, a professor of theoretical epidemiology at Kyoto University, said that even if the pre-emergency measures lead to a 30-percent reduction in the so-called effective reproduction number, which shows how many people a COVID-19 patient has infected, Osaka would still see about 400 patients with serious symptoms by around April 26. “A state of emergency should be declared immediately and stronger measures implemented to reduce the number of new cases,” Nishiura said. “Waiting for weak effects will lead to not being able to save lives that could have been saved.” Some participants at an April 16 meeting of the government panel of experts dealing with the pandemic also called for a state of emergency for Osaka. Shigeru Omi, the panel chairman, appearing at an April 16 session of the Lower House Health, Labor and Welfare Committee, stated that a decision would likely have to be made early in the coming week. As Osaka Prefecture continued to grapple with the crisis, Kanagawa, Saitama, Chiba and Aichi prefectures were designated as requiring pre-emergency measures from April 20. Kanagawa Governor Yuji Kuroiwa, who just a week ago had been cautious about the need for such measures, said April 15 that with the increase in new COVID-19 cases after the lifting of the state of emergency, pre-emergency measures may have to be repeatedly required until numbers drop significantly and vaccinations spread through a large part of the local population.

The government’s task force said the stronger measures would be taken in Saitama, Chiba, Kanagawa and Aichi prefectures from April 20 to May 11, covering the Golden Week string of holidays. Specifically, the municipalities that will fall under the measures are: Saitama and Kawaguchi in Saitama Prefecture; Ichikawa, Funabashi, Matsudo, Kashiwa and Urayasu in Chiba Prefecture; Yokohama, Kawasaki and Sagamihara in Kanagawa Prefecture; and Nagoya in Aichi Prefecture. The government’s expert panel on the dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic agreed on the measures earlier in the day. After talks with health minister Norihisa Tamura and other Cabinet members, Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga told reporters on April 15 that he is very concerned about the spread of variant COVID-19 strains across the nation. “In Aichi Prefecture, the number of new COVID-19 patients is growing faster, and the number of variant strain cases is also increasing,” he said. On the same day, Aichi Prefecture asked the central government for the pre-emergency measures and plans to designate its capital, Nagoya. The three prefectural governments of Saitama, Chiba and Kanagawa held their respective task force meetings on April 15 and decided to request the pre-emergency measures. The central government lifted the COVID-19 state of emergency for Tokyo and those three neighboring prefectures on March 21. But the number of infections has again resurged in the capital area. The Asahi Shimbun The health ministry’s expert panel said the number of new COVID-19 patients has been increasing in April in Kanagawa and Saitama prefectures. The experts also said that the overall number of new virus cases in Chiba Prefecture is leveling off or even trending downward, but infections remain at a high level in areas near its border with Tokyo. They said the number of new patients, particularly those in their 20s and 30s, has been soaring since late March in Aichi Prefecture, while the overall rate of increase has also remained high in the central Japan prefecture. The pre-emergency measures are equivalent to those taken under the state of emergency. Residents in areas under the pre-emergency measures will be asked to avoid nonessential travel across prefectural borders, including during the Golden Week holidays. The pre-emergency measures also allow governors to ask businesses, such as eating and drinking establishments, to close by 8 p.m. If they comply with the requests, they will receive cash handouts whose amount is based on the scale of the business. If they refuse to comply, governors can order them to close early or even impose fines. Local government officials will widen their patrols to strictly check to see if businesses are taking appropriate anti-virus measures, including installing barriers to protect customers against possibly virus-carrying droplets.

0,British variant expected to cause most infections in Japan in May,['By KAI ICHINO/ Staff Writer'],"April 16, 2021 at 17:02 JST"," The British variant of the novel coronavirus that has fueled a medical crisis in Osaka Prefecture will spread and become the dominant infection source nationwide in May, health experts said. Using test results up to early April, the National Institute of Infectious Diseases analyzed the ratio of patients who contracted COVID-19 variants and the increase in the number of patients. Based on the results, the experts estimated that 90 percent of the new COVID-19 patients in the Kansai region and Okinawa Prefecture as of mid-April had been infected with the N501Y variant. The ratio in the Tokai region was estimated at 80 percent, and 50 percent in the areas around Tokyo. “If this pace continues, most of the new cases (in Japan) will be N501Y in early May,” Motoi Suzuki, head of the NIID’s Infectious Diseases Surveillance Center, said. Variants from Brazil and South Africa have infected people in Japan, but the most dominant one here has been the N501Y strain that originated in Britain, according to the analysis. The variants will likely spread the fastest in Okinawa Prefecture and cause most of the new cases in late April, the experts said. In the Kansai region, including Osaka Prefecture, the ratio of COVID-19 patients infected with new strains is expected to exceed 90 percent of all new cases on May 1 at the earliest. The experts also said the ratio will likely top 90 percent in early May in the central Tokai region and the greater Tokyo metropolitan area. In areas where the number of new COVID-19 cases is small, it will take more time for the COVID-19 strains to spread there. The trend in the Tohoku region is still under analysis, but the northeastern region will be in the same situation as the other variant-hit areas in the near future, Suzuki said. The health ministry’s panel of experts on April 14 discussed the possibility that the new variants will sequentially replace the old ones and become dominant around Japan next month. Takaji Wakita, who chairs the ministry’s panel and heads the NIID, said the spread of highly contagious variants have heightened the latest wave of infections. “The movement of people after the state of emergency was lifted and during the change in the fiscal year has had a big impact on the (current surge in infections),” he said. The ministry’s panel also discussed the current situation in Osaka Prefecture at the April 14 meeting. According to the Osaka prefectural government’s data, the time between developing symptoms and becoming severely ill has shortened by a day. Between October 2020 and February this year, the median period for such a development was eight days. But from March 1 to April 13, after the new strains spread widely, the median value was seven days. The percentage of new patients under 60 years old has increased in the prefecture, according to the data. From October 2020 until February this year, people in that age group accounted for 17.5 percent of all severely ill patients in the prefecture. The ratio jumped to 33.5 percent during the period from March 1 to April 13. However, the panel said the number of cases for the age group is relatively small and more analyses will be needed to determine if the new strains are causing the upward trend.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14331850

1,"Safer, faster COVID-19 test based on blood, urine samples",['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"April 16, 2021 at 08:00 JST"," KUMAMOTO--The old saying about safety in numbers couldn't be more true when it comes to ensuring that testing for the novel coronavirus is done in a manner that does not expose medical professionals to the risk of infection. Researchers here say they have developed a safer and quicker way to show if a patient tests positive for the virus. A research team headed by Kazuhito Tomizawa, a professor of molecular physiology at Kumamoto University’s Faculty of Life Sciences, said it had completed a test method that relied on blood and urine samples rather than nasal swipes. As infectious strains of the virus are absent from blood and urine, the test is expected to lower the risk of health care providers becoming infected compared with traditional polymerase chain reaction (PCR) solutions. The testing developed by Tomizawa and his colleagues takes advantage of a substance known as modified nucleoside in blood and urinary samples to detect the virus. The team analyzed blood and urine specimens collected from COVID-19 patients in Kumamoto Prefecture. From among 100 or so kinds of modified nucleoside, it identified two that show marked increases following infection regardless of whether patients show any symptoms. The method boasts almost the same level of accuracy as the PCR technique. Making a diagnosis under this method takes no more than 40 or 50 minutes. Testing technicians also do not have to don protective gear or work in a biosafety environment to prevent the spread of the virus, team members said. When the indicators record high figures in the testing procedure, patients are more prone to see their condition deteriorate suddenly, the researchers said. The gravity of symptoms and the degree of recovery also turned out to be reflected in the barometers. For this reason, the researchers anticipate that their testing procedure can be used when deciding which facility to accommodate certain patients and tracing their health condition during treatment.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14323922

0,Osaka hospital beds for serious COVID-19 cases now all filled up,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"April 15, 2021 at 16:54 JST"," OSAKA—The health care system in Osaka Prefecture is now in such a critical situation that hospitals fear they may soon have to turn away seriously ill COVID-19 patients. There are now more patients with severe symptoms than the number of available hospital beds for their treatment in the prefecture. The prefecture has squeaked by after some medical institutions initially designated to treat those with minor or medium symptoms were forced to treat patients with serious symptoms because no other facility was willing to take them in. Exasperating the crisis is a chronic shortage of nurses. One facility in Osaka city’s Sumiyoshi Ward that opened in December 2020 specifically to treat patients with serious symptoms has 30 hospital beds. But it can use only 16 of them because of the lack of medical personnel. To fully operate all 30 beds would require 120 nurses, but the facility had only 72 as of April 14. Attendees at a prefectural government task force meeting on April 14 agreed that the health care system had gone beyond a “tight situation” to “a crisis in treating patients with serious symptoms.” Osaka Prefecture confirmed a record 1,130 new COVID-19 cases the same day, the second straight day of more than 1,000 newly confirmed infections. The prefectural government has set aside 232 hospital beds for those with serious symptoms. On April 14, there were 219 patients in hospitals for those with serious symptoms, but 20 others were being treated in facilities that should only be handling those with less serious symptoms. That means a total of 239 seriously ill patients are being treated, seven above the capacity set by the prefectural government. On March 18, Osaka Prefecture had only 54 patients with serious symptoms, but in about a month’s time, the number jumped by 185. In comparison, it took about three months for the number of patients with serious symptoms to increase by 170 in the prefecture during the third wave of COVID-19 between October 2020 and February, according to an analysis by the Osaka prefectural government. The spread of COVID-19 variants is believed to be behind the fourfold acceleration in cases in the current fourth wave. “There has been an effect from the variant strains,” Osaka Governor Hirofumi Yoshimura said at his April 14 news conference, referring to the hospital bed situation. “The pace of new infections has quickened, and more patients are prone to develop serious symptoms.” An official at one hospital close to capacity on April 14 for those with serious symptoms had a grim outlook if the prefecture cannot control the spread of the virus. “Unless the number of new cases decreases, we will reach a stage where we will have to decide which patient can be saved and which cannot,” the official said. The situation is also affecting facilities designed to treat patients with less serious symptoms because additional personnel are needed to take care of patients with serious symptoms. Osaka Gyomeikan Hospital in Konohana Ward has set aside 17 beds for patients with minor symptoms. But on April 9 one of the patients developed more serious symptoms, and the hospital could not find another facility that would accept the patient as of April 13. Osaka Gyomeikan Hospital, in fact, has temporarily stopped accepting patients with minor symptoms because it needs more nurses to help treat those whose conditions worsen. An official with the organization managing the hospital said: “If we are unable to transfer patients with serious symptoms, we may become unable to save lives that might have been saved. If we cannot look after those with minor symptoms because of a lack of staff, the medical care structure will collapse.” (Shohei Sasagawa and Taichi Kobayashi contributed to this article.)",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14331155

1,Scientists say 4th virus wave has struck; politician begs to differ,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"April 15, 2021 at 14:40 JST"," Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga came under fire for rejecting the views of leading scientists, including the chief of the government’s expert panel, that a new wave of COVID-19 cases is hitting Japan. “There is no doubt that Japan is entering the fourth wave of infections,” Shigeru Omi, an infectious disease expert who heads the government panel to respond to the novel coronavirus pandemic, said at the Lower House’s Health, Labor and Welfare Committee on April 14. He said COVID-19 variants, which are believed to be more contagious and potentially more deadly, are now rapidly sweeping across Tokyo and Aichi Prefecture after trouncing Osaka and Hyogo prefectures. Omi also said Osaka Prefecture’s situation is severe enough for the central government to consider putting the prefecture back under a state of emergency. The prefecture is currently taking pre-emergency measures to fight the virus, but Omi suggested the alert level there be raised to the maximum. Osaka Prefecture reported a record 1,130 new COVID-19 cases on April 14. The same day, the national total of new cases hit 4,312, the first time since Jan. 28 for the count to top 4,000. Toshio Nakagawa, chairman of the Japan Medical Association, shared Omi’s take at a regular news conference on April 14 and called on the central government to take prompt action against the growing health crisis. “I believe that it is the fourth wave of infections, with the waves getting higher and higher,” he said. “Declaring a state of emergency early may be needed as a pre-emptive move to slow the spread, depending on the extent of the prevalence. If a state of emergency must be issued, it will be more effective to announce it sooner than later.” Suga, however, remained unconvinced. “New infections have yet to become large waves nationwide,” he said at an Upper House plenary session. “But we understand that the country is in a situation that the government should handle with a strong sense of caution.” Yukio Edano, leader of the main opposition Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan, lashed out at the prime minister. “It is impossible to respond appropriately (to the virus) if the government turns a blind eye to objective facts,” he told a gathering of party members. The government is expected to discuss which local governments should come under pre-emergency measures against the novel coronavirus. The pre-emergency measures, which give local authorities more power to enforce anti-virus restrictions, have been applied in six prefectures, including Tokyo, but other areas that have also seen surges in infection numbers have indicated they will request the measures from the central government. According to health ministry data, the number of new cases from variant strains nationwide rose by 839 over the week through April 6, compared with the preceding week. The week-over-week rise then jumped to 1,525 between April 7 and April 13. In Osaka Prefecture, variants have caused an accumulated total of 770 infections up to April 13, an increase of 273 from the previous week. The figure was 146 in Kyoto Prefecture, up by 76. Tokyo saw the steepest rise in new cases from variants, with the overall total reaching 418 through April 13, 319 more than a week earlier. In Aichi Prefecture, the number was 114, an increase of 67. But these numbers may not reflect the actual situation. Only up to 10 percent of positive test samples have been screened for the variants.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14331132

Aichi Governor Hideaki Omura on April 13 revealed his plan to ask the central government for the stronger measures to tackle the health crisis. “Our medical care system has not been strained yet, but I would like to make a preventive response to the resurgence,” he said at a news conference. Omura indicated that he would like to see the pre-emergency measures remain in his central Japan prefecture until the end of the Golden Week string of holidays in early May. The central government will also hold talks with Saitama Prefecture, located immediately north of Tokyo, about the pre-emergency measures. “The number of new patients infected with variant strains has jumped in the last few weeks, so I have no choice but to consider the pre-emergency measures,” Saitama Governor Motohiro Ono said at a news conference on April 13 after a meeting of health experts. The pre-emergency measures are equivalent to those under a state of emergency, and they give governors more authority to ask businesses to shorten operating hours and accept other anti-virus restrictions.

0,"Infected patients denied right to vote under legal, health rules",['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"April 14, 2021 at 07:00 JST"," Health protocols enforced during the novel coronavirus crisis have made it effectively impossible for some infected patients to vote in elections, a possible violation of their constitutional rights. Patients with mild conditions are supposed to stay at hotels or other facilities for recuperation, even on election days. Although absentee and early voting are available, these systems have proved insufficient to deal with the problem as the virus continues to spread around the nation. Local governments are calling for legal revisions ahead of the Lower House election scheduled for autumn at the latest. In the Tokyo governor’s election in July last year, polling stations were not installed at accommodation facilities for COVID-19 patients because of the “high risk of election staff being infected.” On March 21, infected individuals at such lodging sites could not cast their ballots in the Chiba governor’s election. Immediately before the election, then Chiba Governor Kensaku Morita asked “the state to hold discussions” on the problem. The internal affairs ministry has since recommended setting up polling stations in hotels where COVID-19 patients are staying. But a staff member of the election administration commission in Chiba Prefecture said legal changes are needed. “Many patients are cooped up, so implementing measures like the ones suggested by the internal affairs ministry is difficult,” the official said. “The Public Offices Election Law or the coronavirus special measures law need to be revised to realize absentee balloting at hotels.” Official campaigning started on April 11 for the Nagoya mayor’s election on April 25, but patients in isolation will likely be unable to vote. Election officials have cited the difficulty of disinfecting all things and places touched by infected voters and safely removing ballots from polling places in their accommodation facilities. COVID-19 patients at hotels are not allowed to go out for 10 or so days following the onset of the disease, and they can only move in specific areas in such facilities. The rules make it impossible for them to venture outdoors to vote during the period. Under the Public Offices Election Law, those unable to vote on election days have two options available: early voting and absentee balloting. But municipalities responsible for administrative procedures in local elections view both alternatives as unrealistic in the coronavirus crisis. The early voting mechanism is intended for voters who cannot visit balloting places on time, but they can only vote in the municipalities where they reside. COVID-19 patients stuck in hotels outside their municipalities are out of luck. Absentee balloting allows not only people staying outside election sites but also hospitalized individuals to cast ballots at specially installed voting sites or facilities if certain conditions are met. They can also vote by mail. But these options appear inapplicable for COVID-19 patients. The Public Offices Election Law stipulates that voting at dedicated polling zones in hotels must be done in the presence of observers. However, a problem lies in how to protect election staff from infection by patients at those places. In addition, hotels are not listed under the law’s category of specified facilities, which include medical centers and care homes, where absentee voting is possible. COVID-19 patients staying at accommodation facilities are not eligible for postal voting, which is designed for people who cannot go out without assistance because of serious physical disorders or other reasons. The central government deems postal voting as exceptional because it is conducted without observers. To ensure fairness, the government remains cautious about expanding the system’s scope. The internal affairs ministry on March 10 sent a notification to the election administration panels in Hokkaido, Nagano and Hiroshima prefectures on how to hold national elections in the pandemic. The notice says recuperating COVID-19 patients can vote “if polling stations are introduced for early and absentee balloting within lodging facilities.” The ministry had in mind two by-elections and one re-election for Diet seats scheduled for April 25. The notice did little to erase growing concerns among local governments that many voters would be unable to take part in the next Lower House election unless legislation is amended for COVID-19 patients. The April 25 elections are seen as a test of whether the national election can be properly held for all voters. A Sapporo city election committee official in charge of administrative procedures for the Lower House by-election in the Hokkaido No. 2 constituency remains skeptical. “We will not make polling available at accommodation facilities because it would be impossible to keep election staff away from coronavirus patients,” the official said. Working with the Hokkaido election board, the Sapporo voting committee in late March submitted a request to the central government and other entities to allow COVID-19 patients to vote by mail. The Hiroshima prefectural election administration commission and other entities said on April 8 that early voting stations will be set up in four hotels. As of April 7, 47 COVID-19 patients were recuperating at those hotels. The internal affairs ministry said Hiroshima Prefecture is the first in the nation to take such a measure for a Diet election. Akira Kurata, a constitutional professor at Ritsumeikan University’s School of Law, who is knowledgeable about the Public Offices Election Law, said that leaving elections inaccessible to infected voters could go against the Constitution. “It can be said that universal suffrage guaranteed by the Constitution is being infringed upon,” Kurata said. He said the rights of people to express their opinions through elections must be protected, and that the Diet should have reviewed the Public Offices Election Law when it revised the coronavirus special measures law. “An environment should have been established via countermeasures, such as reinforcing the postal voting system, so that coronavirus patients recovering at hotels can vote,” he said. “A mechanism should be developed as soon as possible to enable even those who have tested positive to cast ballots.” (This article was written by Kana Yamada, Susumu Imaizumi and Takahiro Okubo.)",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14327227

As precautions against the novel coronavirus, Olympic torchbearers run through the city's closed Expo ’70 Commemorative Park with only a limited number of spectators allowed, including runners’ families, staff members and media representatives. Osaka Prefecture became the first local government to decide not to hold the event on public roads in its jurisdiction. Pre-emergency measures against the spread of the virus began in Osaka, Hyogo and Miyagi prefectures on April 5. The measures were also applied for Tokyo as well as Kyoto and Okinawa prefectures on April 12. The April 13 relay marks 20 days since the torch relay began on March 25 in Fukushima Prefecture. The opening of the Tokyo Olympics will be 100 days away on April 14. The relay is taking place as people across Japan are being asked to refrain from nonessential travel. The relay's roughly 3-kilometer route installed in the park was divided into 15 sections, with each torchbearer running some 200 meters. The organizers allowed up to four family members or friends per runner to see the relay at the park, but limited the number of cars accompanying each torchbearer to a minimum.

The high ratio of hospital beds in use for those with serious symptoms could continue for another month or so, according to the sources. Pre-emergency measures to deal with the pandemic have been in place in Osaka city since April 5, but they have so far not shown any sign of reducing new cases. The situation has been especially serious this month as daily case records were set on three consecutive days from April 6 when there were 719 cases. The figure rose to 878 the next day and to 905 on April 8. Another record of 918 was set on April 10. In the seven days between March 31 to April 6, a record 4,146 new cases were reported, about four times the figure for two weeks earlier. One prefectural government official dealing with the health crisis said, “The peak in infections will likely come this week or next.” One characteristic of what prefectural government officials are calling the fourth wave of infections is the large ratio of young people infected. Between March 15 and April 5, 55.1 percent of all new cases were patients under 40. That's about 10 percentage points higher than the 45.6 percent of the third wave that came last autumn. Osaka prefectural government officials had urged caution about the risks of developing serious symptoms among senior citizens, but the ratio of those with serious symptoms and under 60 in age was 27.9 percent, much higher than the 17.5 percent of the third wave. Prefectural government officials predict a further increase in those with serious symptoms as more infections spread from younger people to senior citizens. That means an increasing urgency will be securing hospital beds for those with serious symptoms. The prefectural government had secured 224 hospital beds for patients with serious symptoms and as of April 12, 90.6 percent of those beds were being used.

A panel of experts handling the COVID-19 pandemic agreed to the measures on the morning of April 9, and the government task force approved the designation later the same day. “We will strive to restrain another surge in infections to prevent an even larger spread in the future,” Yasutoshi Nishimura, the state minister in charge of economic revitalization who also leads the central government’s response to the pandemic, said at the experts’ panel meeting. Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike was expected to designate the 23 wards of the capital as well as six cities in the western part of Tokyo as the areas to be covered by the pre-emergency measures. Kyoto city will be the only municipality to be covered in that prefecture, while the measures will apply in nine cities in Okinawa, including the capital of Naha. The measures are expected to go into effect on April 12 for all three prefectures.

1,Officials hope travel subsidies help tourism amid virus surge,['By SHO HATSUMI/ Staff Writer'],"April 9, 2021 at 17:30 JST"," Although a new government travel subsidy program is seeking to boost local tourism, standards remain ambiguous as to when entities should halt their campaigns if coronavirus cases surge in their areas. Twenty-one prefectures, including Akita and Oita, have launched their own discount programs so far, according to the Japan Tourism Agency. However, if a local government does not immediately halt a discount tourism campaign in case the number of infections rapidly increases, the risk of spreading the virus will become high. A JTA official said, “It is up to each local government” to apply for the financial assistance. The official added that the central government will support local entities if they qualify for the subsidy and have implemented proper anti-virus measures. The JTA plan, announced on March 26, offers support to local government’s efforts to boost their respective tourism industries, hit hard during the pandemic. Under the program, the central government will allocate 300 billion yen ($2.7 billion) to help prefectural plans to encourage residents to travel more and subsidize each trip up to 7,000 yen per person per night. Welcoming the news, Akita prefectural government on April 3 launched a campaign that covers half the lodging expenses and tour package--up to 5,000 yen per person--for prefectural residents traveling within the prefecture. The campaign will continue until the end of May. An Akita official said the prefectural government has arranged the campaign period and the discount rate according to the central government’s subsidy plan to “qualify for the financial assistance with absolute certainty.” The campaign is expected to cost 3 billion yen, but the prefectural government anticipates it will be fully covered by the central government. The JTA has twice hosted a meeting to explain the subsidy system. Officials from all 47 prefectures were in attendance. But as of the morning of April 8, no local government had filed a formal application to receive the funds because the process takes time. One condition to receive the subsidy is that the COVID-19 situation has to remain at a “Stage 2” level or lower in the index set by the central government’s panel of experts to deal with the pandemic. But each local government must make its own judgment about whether it is remaining at that level. An Akita prefectural official said, “We will make a decision on a case-by-case basis.” Tourism minister Kazuyoshi Akaba said, “It is wrong to think of the (subsidy program) as a way to spur people to travel right now.” For now, Akita prefectural officials are proceeding with the local travel campaign program. Later this month, the prefectural government will hand out discount coupons that can be used at souvenir stores and other businesses, using the subsidy system. The prefectural government has also extended the expiration date for use of its own plan to boost tourism, launched in 2020, by offering the purchaser of a hotel coupon a half-price discount until the end of June. Using the coupon with the central government’s subsidy discount program, the discount can be as much as 80 percent, the prefectural government said. The Oita prefectural government has also expanded the budget for travel discounts for residents who travel within the prefecture. The government launched the program on March 20. Initially, the project cost was 200 million yen. But anticipating receiving the subsidy from the central government, the prefectural government has increased the expected expenditure to 3.7 billion yen. An Oita official said the prefecture “relies on the tourism industry” and the local government has calculated the cost based on the subsidy from the central government. In addition to the existing campaign, the prefectural government will start issuing a 2,000-yen coupon per person from May.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14327731

Koike told an April 8 meeting of an experts’ panel set up by the metropolitan government that she would make the request to the central government. She also asked the public to “refrain from outings that involve crossing a prefectural border” as well as to avoid trips to other major urban areas where infections are spreading. The pre-emergency measures, which will give Koike more authority to ask businesses to close early and to take other precautions, will likely be implemented for the 23 Tokyo wards as well as part of the Tama region in western Tokyo. The state of emergency for Tokyo and three neighboring prefectures was lifted on March 22, but the Tokyo metropolitan government has continued asking bars and restaurants to close at 9 p.m. until April 21. The number of COVID-19 cases in Tokyo exceeded 500 on April 7 for the first time in about two months. Osaka Prefecture the same day also confirmed a record 878 new cases. High-ranking Tokyo metropolitan government officials felt a need to ask for designation for the pre-emergency measures to be able to ask Tokyo residents to refrain as much as possible from making unnecessary trips to the Kansai region.

0,Coronavirus variant cases grew 14-fold in a single month,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"April 8, 2021 at 16:39 JST"," Mutant strains of the novel coronavirus are spreading so rapidly that experts are calling for immediate measures to discourage people in hotspot areas from going on unnecessary outings. Between the end of February and the end of March, cases of coronavirus variants increased by about 14-fold across Japan, new data shows. There were only 56 cases of variant infections reported in the last week of February, but the figure grew at a rapid clip until it reached 767 by the week of March 22 to 28. While the problem is especially prominent now in prefectures in western Japan, experts warn the Tokyo area could see a major increase in variant cases over the next month. The variant first discovered in Britain in December is believed to be the main one spreading like wildfire in Osaka and Hyogo. Evidence points to the strain not only being more infectious, but also posing a higher risk of patients developing serious symptoms and dying. The average number of people a single COVID-19 patient will infect, known as the effective reproduction number, is much higher for the variant strain. The average figure for the period between Feb. 1 and March 22 was 1.32-fold higher for the variant strain compared to the original virus. Testing found variants made up 75 percent of the cases in Hyogo Prefecture and 54 percent of the cases for Osaka Prefecture. The corresponding figure was much lower for Tokyo, at just 3 percent. But experts warn if variant cases increase at the current rate, they could make up about 70 percent of new infections by May 1. Authorities have implemented special precautionary measures to rein in the spread of infections in five cities in Hyogo and Osaka prefectures despite a state of emergency not being in effect. But at an April 7 meeting of a panel of experts reporting to the health ministry, members pointed to the rapid surge in infections in municipalities outside of Osaka city, as well as in the neighboring prefectures of Kyoto, Nara and Wakayama, as cause for alarm. Experts said authorities should be urging residents to refrain from making unnecessary outings and traveling outside their prefectures. They expressed uncertainty and raised criticisms over the effectiveness of the pre-emergency measures put in place in Osaka and Hyogo, which have so far mainly focused on shortening the business hours of bars and restaurants. One panel member said during the meeting that Osaka was too slow in implementing new measures. “If I lived in Osaka, I would not leave my home,” another member said. “This is not a situation of allowing wining and dining while wearing face masks. I believe there should be a call for residents to stay home.” Under current guidelines, people who become infected with the variant strain and are treated at hospitals can only leave after two negative polymerase chain reaction tests. But some experts at the April 7 meeting called for doing away with that requirement to free up more hospital beds. They called for other standards to be used to allow patients to leave the hospital. The variant is meanwhile infecting children under 10 at a higher proportion than the original virus, data shows. As of April 6, 15 percent of those infected by the variant strain were in their 40s, while 10 percent were under 10. Children under 10 only made up about 3 percent of the cases of the original virus. Experts still do not know why the variant strain is infecting more children. (This article was compiled from reports by Jun Tabushi and Akiyoshi Abe.)",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14327089

The figure was 2.1 times the 13 percent recorded in the previous survey conducted in May last year. The team, led by Shinya Kuno, a professor of health policy at the University of Tsukuba, studied the impact on senior citizens from staying at home during the pandemic. The researchers mailed questionnaires to around 4,700 people aged 60 or older who live in five cities and towns in Hokkaido as well as in Saitama, Kyoto and other prefectures. They were asked to choose from multiple responses to each question. The queries included how frequently they went on outings or exercised, as well as the extent of their memory loss as of November, compared with the period up until January 2020, before the novel coronavirus began spreading in Japan. An analysis of their responses found that about 1,300 respondents, or about 27 percent, had a decline in their cognitive functions, such as comprehension and judgment, from pre-pandemic levels. Kuno pointed out that most elderly people have yet to become as active as they were before the pandemic, even after the nation’s first COVID-19 state of emergency was lifted in spring last year. He believes that a lack of exercise and fewer conversations with others reduced the stimulation for senior citizens’ brains, taking a toll on their mental and physical well-being. Kuno said a more concerning matter is the impact of the third wave of infections that hit the country from autumn through winter. “I’m worried that more elderly people may be deemed in need of nursing care from this spring,” Kuno said. “We need to find a way to continue offering them opportunities to engage in community activities while taking precautions against infections.”",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14314673

""The infections have continued to explode at a faster rate than before,"" Osaka Governor Hirofumi Yoshimura said at a meeting of the prefectural headquarters to deal with the novel coronavirus pandemic. ""Our health care system is in a dire situation, and we need to issue a state of medical emergency."" It was the second time for the prefecture to issue a red alert, based on its own standards called the “Osaka model.” The last time the alert was issued was in December 2020. But apparently, the new warning came too late to raise awareness as officials confirmed the daily count of new infections on April 7 at 878, the highest ever. Yoshimura said the main reason for the rapid infection spread is the highly contagious U.K. coronavirus variant. The U.K. variant ""spreads much faster and patients are more likely to develop severe symptoms much faster,"" he said. One of the guidelines that the prefectural government has set to issue a red alert is the occupancy rate of hospital beds for patients with severe symptoms reaching 70 percent or more. On April 6, the prefectural government confirmed a record 719 new infections, the first time the daily count exceeded 700. There were 149 patients currently hospitalized with severe symptoms. The occupancy rate of the 224 hospital beds that the prefectural government has secured was 66.5 percent. Hospital beds have been filling at a pace far exceeding December 2020, which prompted the first red alert. “If the trend continues, hospitals will likely be overwhelmed,” Osaka Governor Hirofumi Yoshimura told reporters on April 6. By issuing a state of medical emergency, the prefectural government will once again urge residents to refrain from going out or traveling for non-essential purposes. Restaurants and bars in the city of Osaka will be asked to follow the government’s request to close by 8 p.m. In the meantime, the prefectural government will hurriedly secure more hospital beds and health care workers. The prefectural government on April 5 asked hospitals of a certain size that have beds for patients with mild and moderate symptoms to continue to treat two or more patients even if their condition becomes more severe. The request arose out of concern that hospital units with beds for patients with severe symptoms may be unable to take in new patients.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14326458

The central government issued stronger preventive measures for the three prefectures, which began on April 5, to allow the governors to request or order businesses to shorten their hours, even without a state of emergency in effect, and punish those disobeying. They will ask restaurants, bars and other establishments close by 8 p.m. for 31 days, until May 5, when the Golden Week holidays end, in six cities: Osaka, Sendai in Miyagi Prefecture and Kobe, Nishinomiya, Amagasaki and Ashiya in Hyogo Prefecture. The governors can impose administrative fines of up to 200,000 yen ($1,800) for ignoring the orders. But they will also hand out cash to businesses that cooperate. Restaurants and bars complying with the requests can get anywhere from 40,000 yen to 200,000 yen per day based on the size of their business and their sales. Osaka Prefecture is asking these businesses to take stricter measures on ensuring diners wear face masks and to install acrylic boards to separate customers to prevent the virus from spreading. The prefectural government will check some 60,000 eating and drinking establishments in Osaka to determine whether they are complying with the requests. Hyogo Prefecture will also check about 16,000 businesses in its four cities to inspect whether they are implementing virus countermeasures. Miyagi Prefecture will ask eating and drinking establishments in Sendai to close shop by 8 p.m. and urge their customers to wear face masks during meals. The prefectural government will implement its own measures in Sendai and elsewhere on top of the new measures. In Sendai, movie theaters, gyms and other facilities will be asked to close by 8 p.m. and restrict how many people are allowed inside. The prefectural government will ask restaurants and bars that provide companionship services or alcohol to close by 9 p.m. in all parts of Miyagi Prefecture. When the measures officially came into effect on the morning of April 5 in Osaka, little seemed to have changed from the week before. Commuters wearing face masks crowded into JR Osaka Station. “The commuter train was packed with many people as usual,” said a 44-year-old woman who works at a company and is a resident of Ibaraki in Osaka Prefecture. “Everybody is wearing masks and staying silent, but I feel some anxiety.” During the state of emergency, she worked from home, but she needs to return to the office now, while the pre-emergency measures are in place. “Honestly, I want to work remotely, but I cannot help going to the office,” she said. At the biggest entertainment and shopping district in the Tohoku region, in Sendai’s Aoba Ward, many local “izakaya” pubs and the beef tongue barbeque restaurants that the city is famous for posted notices on their entrances that said “temporarily closed” or “shortened business hours.” Kotomi Numakura, an 18-year-old company employee from Tomiya, Miyagi Prefecture, was at JR Sendai Station heading off to a new workplace for training sessions. “I think (the pre-emergency measures) were placed so late.

0,Ministry: 80% of COVID-19 deaths in Japan came after November,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"April 5, 2021 at 17:56 JST"," Eighty percent of all COVID-19 deaths in Japan occurred in the third wave of infections starting in November, government data showed, and health experts warn a potentially deadlier fourth wave is near. By the end of March, the country’s fatalities from the novel coronavirus totaled 9,173, excluding deaths of people who were confirmed infected on the Diamond Princess cruise ship and at quarantine at airports and ports, according to health ministry data. Of the total, 7,404 have died since November. Three-fourths of those fatalities were reported in eight prefectures--Tokyo, Hokkaido, Saitama, Chiba, Kanagawa, Aichi, Osaka and Hyogo--where the virus spread rapidly. The steep surge in deaths was caused largely by cluster infections at places with people more at risk of developing severe symptoms. Such outbreaks jumped fivefold at nursing homes and tripled at hospitals during the months since November compared with the numbers through the second wave of infections to October, the data showed. In large cities, more than half of the COVID-19 patients who died contracted the virus through cluster infections at those facilities, according to the data. In what has become a familiar refrain, Shigeru Omi, who heads a government expert panel responding to the pandemic, said Japan is at a “critical point” in stemming a rebound of infections. Some experts fear that Japan is now entering a fourth wave of infections involving more contagious and deadly variants. Such strains are sweeping across Osaka, Hyogo and nearby prefectures, threatening to proliferate all over the country. The worrying trend comes at a time when residents in the Tokyo metropolitan area and other urban centers have become more complacent about following safety protocols after two and a half months of restricted mobility and reduced outings under a state of emergency. In addition, Japan is woefully lagging behind other Group of 20 advanced and emerging economies in terms of vaccinating its population, according to one estimate. Japan started its vaccine program with health care workers in February and plans to begin inoculating elderly people this month. But the supplies of vaccines are limited, and nobody knows when the government can complete the vaccination of all eligible people. Data from the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare showed that patients aged 60 or older accounted for 96 percent of the deaths in the third wave. People 80 or older were particularly hard hit, representing 67 percent of those deaths. The ministry data showed that by the end of March, there were 1,176 cases in which two or more people tested positive for the virus at the same nursing care facility. The comparable number for hospitals was 992. There were 1,064 cases of such infections at restaurants by the end of March, twice the number of the accumulated total through October. In Tokyo, about 1,100 deaths were reported between January and March. Nearly 60 percent occurred at nursing care facilities and hospitals and about 10 percent at home. Health officials are investigating the locations of the remaining 30 percent. A similar trend was seen in Osaka Prefecture. Fifty-four percent of the deaths that occurred at nursing and medical facilities between Oct. 10 and March 25 resulted from cluster infections there. A key reason behind the soaring number of the new cases in the third wave is the government’s failure to carry out widespread diagnostic testing of people who are most vulnerable. In August, the government said it will “take full precautions against the virus to protect the elderly and people with underlying conditions.” But widespread tests aimed at detecting infections at an early stage were not conducted at those facilities. Authorities also dragged their feet in taking measures to slow community spreads, a step needed to prevent the virus from reaching nursing homes and hospitals. The government’s expert panel called for decisive anti-virus measures on Nov. 20, including a review of the government’s program to bolster the hard-hit tourism industry by offering discount travel coupons. But the government’s response was more focused on asking bars and restaurants to operate for shorter hours. Tokyo allowed its eating and drinking establishments to remain open for longer hours than those in Osaka Prefecture. With new cases continuing to climb, the travel discount program was suspended nationwide only on Dec. 28. The number of deaths shot up during yearend and New Year holidays. Overloaded with COVID-19 cases, many medical facilities could not accept new patients for hospital treatment. Based on the lessons learned from the third wave, the government plans to ramp up COVID-19 testing and enhance the capacity of hospitals to prepare for the fourth wave of infections. But it will not be easy to contain the disease because people will likely contract the virus through various transmission routes, given the extent of the community spread, and the COVID-19 variants are fast replacing the initial coronavirus strain. “A more chaotic situation will be likely in the fourth wave if the variants make up a majority of new infections,” said Mitsuyoshi Urashima, professor of molecular epidemiology at the Jikei University School of Medicine. “Inoculating the population is the only way to bring the pandemic under control.” Vaccinating elderly people begins on April 12.

0,Smaller regional cities seeing a rebound in COVID-19 cases,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"April 3, 2021 at 18:58 JST"," Small regional cities across Japan are confronting a rebound in daily COVID-19 cases just like Tokyo, Osaka and other major urban centers where a state of emergency was recently in effect. The cities in question also must grapple with their limited capacity to provide hospital beds for patients as well as treatment. As a result, some municipalities have issued emergency measures of their own to stem a further rise in novel coronavirus infections. A number of bars and restaurants in the entertainment district of Nagano city, northwest of Tokyo, began posting signs around noon on April 2 to say their establishments would be closing temporarily. Nagano city authorities had asked the 1,300 establishments that serve alcohol to either shorten their business hours or close temporarily. Nagano Governor Shuichi Abe noted during a March 31 news conference that infections were spreading in bars and restaurants. The decision to request those businesses to cooperate by shortening their operating hours or closing temporarily was a difficult one, he said. During the one-week period until March 30, there were 118 new COVID-19 cases in Nagano city, a roughly 1.6-fold increase over the previous week, prefectural government officials said. The hospital bed usage ratio for northern Nagano Prefecture, which includes Nagano city, had reached about 70 percent. Similar trends are unfolding in other regions. In Ehime Prefecture on the island of Shikoku, the number of COVID-19 patients in hospitals or resting at home or other types of accommodation totaled 342 as of April 2. Alarmingly, the figure was very close to the 345 benchmark the government panel of experts had set to designate a region as being in the most serious stage 4 where new cases are increasing in an “explosive manner.” Ehime Governor Tokihiro Nakamura said his prefecture was now experiencing a “fourth wave” in new infections. On April 1, he asked about 1,700 businesses in the prefecture to reduce their  business hours. The prefectural capital of Matsuyama reported that bars and restaurants were involved in infection clusters of a variant strain of the coronavirus. Infection spread mainly among those in their 20s and 30s, and by April 1 a total of 197 people had been identified as having been infected in those clusters. Nakamura said the variant strain was spreading very quickly and that infections had spread to other age groups in municipalities outside of Matsuyama. In Takamatsu, the capital of Shikoku's Kagawa Prefecture, 10 members and staff of a pro basketball team were confirmed to be infected. The team played a game in March in Saga Prefecture in Kyushu against a team where an infection cluster had occurred. College students who moved from Osaka and Ehime to Takamatsu in line with the start of the new school year from April 1 were also confirmed infected. Kagawa Governor Keizo Hamada indicated he would ask bars and restaurants to shorten their business hours in the week ahead. “We are seeing the effects of an increase in infections in the urban centers,” Hamada said at an April 2 news conference. “Even if we make efforts (within the prefecture) to prevent a further spread, it will be difficult to shut off those effects unless there is a ban in travel across prefectural borders.” (This article was written by Takashi Takizawa, Kuniaki Ito and Urara Yukawa.)",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14324384
1,Osaka governor seeks alternative Olympic torch relay for his city,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"April 3, 2021 at 18:48 JST"," OSAKA--Osaka Governor Hirofumi Yoshimura said April 3 he was weighing his options in the event the Olympic torch relay cannot take place in Osaka city due to the novel coronavirus pandemic. “Torch relay runners have been preparing with all their might for the past year or so,” Yoshimura said on a local TV news program. “We want to implement an alternative” to running on public roads. After Yoshimura made the remarks, Osaka prefectural government officials confirmed there were a daily record 666 new COVID-19 cases on April 3. Osaka city will come under pre-emergency measures to slow the spread of COVID-19 cases from April 5 until May 5 when the Golden Week of national holidays comes to an end. During that period, bars, restaurants and other businesses will be asked to shorten their business hours. This conflicts with the schedule for the Olympic torch relay, which is set to enter Osaka Prefecture on April 13 and the city the following day. Osaka prefectural authorities contend it would be difficult to go ahead with the torch relay in Osaka city, given the pre-emergency measures. Officials of the Tokyo Olympic organizing committee acknowledged in February that there could be instances of the torch relay not taking place on public roads in certain localities that were under a state of emergency or where local government officials had requested residents to refrain from nonessential outings.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14324414

The ward office plans to send the first batch of coupons to around 60,000 residents who are 65 or older. From early morning, busy postal workers were seen sorting individually addressed envelopes, each marked “coupon for novel coronavirus vaccines inside.” The first deliveries were made before noon. Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga has described the vaccine as a “game-changer” in the COVID-19 pandemic. But the process to vaccinate those eligible, starting with health care workers, appears to be taking longer than what the central government has promised. In Sumida Ward, about 245,000 residents are eligible to receive the vaccine, which requires two shots. Those 65 or older will start receiving their first doses from May 10, according to ward officials. Officials expect that about 70 percent of eligible residents will receive their first shots by Sept. 5.

0,Study: COVID-19 strains may lead to economic loss of 7 trillion yen,['By HISATOSHI KABATA/ Staff Writer'],"April 2, 2021 at 16:15 JST"," A state of emergency declared over the spread of novel coronavirus variants in Japan could cause an economic loss of about 7 trillion yen ($63 billion), according to two University of Tokyo economists. That figure is much higher than the estimated economic loss of between 700 billion yen and 800 billion yen arising from the original virus. The study was conducted by Taisuke Nakata, an associate professor of economics at the University of Tokyo, and Daisuke Fujii, a specially appointed lecturer at the same university’s Economics Faculty. They have previously made gloomy forecasts about the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Japanese economy. In the latest simulation, the two economists set the variant strain as being 1.5-fold more infectious than the novel coronavirus. They also used two different rates of the spread of infection. One was the British variant that caused a much faster infection spread, while the other was the American strain that circulated at a slower pace. The economists found that if the spread of the variant in Britain occurred at a similar level in Tokyo, it would take about four months for the British strain to completely replace the previous novel coronavirus in the Japanese capital. It would take about a year for the American case to unfold in Tokyo, they said. The economists estimated the number of daily new infections in Tokyo based on those assumptions. Even under the more optimistic American version, daily new COVID-19 cases would exceed 1,000 by July in the capital, leading to the need for another declaration of a state of emergency. If the British scenario unfolded, 1,000 daily new infections would be reached in June. Moreover, under the British case, another state of emergency would have to be declared in early 2022 because of a new wave of infections following the lifting of the previous state of emergency. The economic loss under the American scenario would be between 3 trillion yen and 4 trillion yen, while the British case would lead to a loss of between 6 trillion yen and 7 trillion yen, they said. The more virulent strains are expected to cause more economic damage because tougher measures would be needed to halt their spread, leading to major declines in economic activity. The study also compared the situations in the Kanto and Kansai regions. Although the economists did not foresee a sudden surge in variant strain infections in Tokyo over the next three to four weeks, the increase in those infections in Osaka Prefecture over the 10-day period from March 21 was much higher than past estimates. They speculate the variant strains may already be affecting economic activity in the Kansai region. Nakata said that delaying a spread of variant strain infections in the Tokyo area by even a month would have major positive effects on the economy, given that the Kanto region accounts for a large portion of the gross domestic product. “With variant strain infections in the Kansai region now apparently at a higher level than the Kanto region, people should not be encouraged to cross prefectural borders,” Nakata said. “In particular, there would be a huge risk with the Go To Travel (tourism-promotion) campaign.”",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14323782

The surge in new infections in the prefecture and surrounding areas prompted the Hanshin Tigers professional baseball team to announce a suspension of ticket sales for a series against the Yomiuri Giants at Koshien Stadium in Nishinomiya, Hyogo Prefecture, from April 6 to 8. The Tigers, who have a large and loyal fan base mainly in the Kansai region, are scheduled to play three night games against their Central League rivals to open the season at Hanshin’s home stadium. The team said it made the decision because the central government has approved pre-emergency measures for cities in Hyogo Prefecture, as well as in Osaka and Miyagi prefectures, from April 5 to stem the increase in new COVID-19 cases. “We will suspend ticket sales until the situation becomes clearer,” a team official said.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14323121
0,Rapid circulation of virus variants in Japan alarms health experts,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"April 1, 2021 at 17:46 JST"," More contagious variants of the novel coronavirus have accelerated their spread around Japan, prompting calls for the public to take extra precautions to prevent a potentially dire situation for the entire nation. According to health ministry data, 1,200 COVID-19 patients tested positive for variant strains in the accumulated total to March 30, up by 408 from the previous week. The ministry’s expert panel on COVID-19 predicted the variants will continue to circulate widely and urged the public not to let their guards down. The Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare tracks the number of patients infected with new strains after performing polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests to identify variants from collected samples. Information on such patients is registered in the government’s HER-SYS system, which includes overall data on COVID-19 patients, including symptoms, infection routes and behavior history. Figures from March 15 to 21 showed that 382 patients tested positive for variants. Hyogo Prefecture reported the largest number of variant infections, with 128. Hyogo and four other prefectures, including Hokkaido and Osaka, accounted for 80 percent of the variant cases confirmed in Japan. But these numbers may represent only a small fraction of the actual spread. Health authorities perform PCR tests for new strains on only 5 to 10 percent of COVID-19 samples. The government plans to raise the ratio to 40 percent to more accurately gauge the spread of the variants. Positive tests for variants are finalized only after genome sequencing is performed on those who tested positive. By March 30, 678 people in 34 prefectures had been confirmed infected by variants, excluding people whose infections were detected during quarantine at airports and ports. The figure is up 129 from the preceding week. People in their 40s accounted for 16 percent of all patients confirmed infected with variants, the largest age group. Children 9 years old or younger represented 12 percent of the total, while 11 percent were teenagers. In contrast, children 9 or younger made up 3 percent and teenagers about 7 percent of novel coronavirus infections before the more transmissible variants were detected in Japan. The variants are also affecting rural areas where the health care systems have limited resources. In Matsuyama, Ehime Prefecture, more than 20 people tested positive for variants. They were infected at gatherings at multiple restaurants in the city’s entertainment district. Five people, from their 40s to 80s, were infected with variants at a pub in Sapporo. The most common variant in Japan was first detected in Britain in September. Its rapid spread forced Britain to impose a strict lockdown three months later. Mitsuyoshi Urashima, professor of molecular epidemiology at the Jikei University School of Medicine, warned that when more transmissible strains circulate, their infection trajectory could be different from that of the novel coronavirus last year. “Even if the ratio of variants among overall infections is not large at the moment, the strains can spread all over the country in one go once they hit a certain level,” he said. “We need to be thorough in public behavior to protect ourselves from the variants.” (This article was written by Hajime Mikami and Kenta Noguchi.)",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14322937

1,Fukuoka hotel says guests must pay COVID-19 cleanup fees,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"March 29, 2021 at 16:37 JST"," A hotel in Fukuoka has caused a legal stir in the accommodation industry by telling guests they would be charged for cleaning fees if they later tested positive for the novel coronavirus. Legal experts say the hotel was out of line with such demands, but those in the industry argue that the related law does not address the current challenge of how they can recoup certain losses caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. In early February, a vocational school in Fukuoka’s Higashi Ward partially closed a dormitory where a student was found infected with the virus. Five other students at the dormitory decided to stay at a nearby hotel to prepare for national exams scheduled on Feb. 21 and 22. A public health center told the students that they did not need to take a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test nor self-quarantine. Several days after they checked in at the hotel, they decided to extend their stay. At the time, the students told a hotel employee that there had been a COVID-19 case at their school. The hotel then delivered its demands. “If you turn out to be carrying the virus, we will charge you 100,000 yen ($910) for cleaning fees,” the hotel told the students. “If that leads other guests to cancel their reservations, then we will also ask you to make up for the loss.” The five students left the hotel and stayed at their friends’ and other places to continue to study. Some of the students were crying in shock and consulted the school about the hotel’s demands, according to school officials. “They were not in close contact with the student who tested positive,” one official said. “Isn’t it a discriminatory response to ask the students to pay for cleaning fees even though the risk of them spreading the virus is low?” The five students did not show any COVID-19 symptoms. But the hotel rebutted the school’s discrimination claim, saying, “We did not refuse accommodation to them.” The hotel also said its response to the five students was based on a previous experience of dealing with the effects of an infection at the school. In 2020, the vocational school closed its dormitory after a student contracted the virus. Another dorm resident then booked into the hotel and tested positive for the virus there. Hotel staff said they were not informed of the source of the student’s infection and whether the hotel guest had been in close contact with the first COVID-19 patient. The student paid for the costs of disinfecting the room. The company that manages the hotel said last year’s incident “caused trouble and concerns for other guests.” “Based on what we learned from that incident, we have asked guests to provide as much detailed information as possible on the premise that they will cooperate,” a company official said. Under the Hotel Business Law, hotels cannot refuse accommodations to guests except in certain situations, such as if the would-be guest has clearly contracted a contagious disease. The health ministry has said hotels can cite the novel coronavirus as a reason to refuse accommodations but only to those who have tested positive. Hotels cannot refuse rooms to people simply because they may have been in close contact with COVID-19 patients, the ministry said. A Fukuoka city government official who is in charge of environmental health said businesses “should contact a public health center and ask what to do when the situation is difficult to determine.” Shunsuke Itai, a lawyer specializing in such issues, said, “It is not surprising that guests feel that they have been refused a room when (a hotel) suggests they pay damages that are higher than the hotel’s normal room fee.” What the hotel told the five students “is deemed a de facto refusal of a room and problematic,” he said. “I understand it is difficult for hotels to respond (in such situations), but the businesses need to give consideration to avoid hurting a guest’s feelings even when the guest is possibly carrying the virus,” Itai said. However, some in the accommodation industry say the law is outdated and needs to be revised. Yoshinori Ochi, a professor at Toyo University who serves as an adviser to the Japan Association of Travel Agents, said there have been cases in which hotels suffer from false rumors and reputational damage after a guest tested positive for the virus while staying there. Ochi said industry groups have called for legal revisions to address such problems. “Asking guests to pay to make up for losses caused by cancellations made by other guests is over the top,” Ochi said. “But the central government should establish an operational rule beforehand and clearly explain it to the industry. It should also provide separate facilities for people who have been in contact with COVID-19 patients to wait and see (if they are also infected.)” (This article was written by Takahiro Takenouchi, Amane Shimazaki and Hayato Jinno.)",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14314270

Preliminary figures of newborns released by the ministry include the number of non-Japanese born in the country and Japanese born overseas. The latest figures reflect the trend of putting off having children amid the COVID-19 pandemic, raising concerns about a further drop in the birthrate. The number of births in January fell by 10,930 from the 74,672 recorded a year ago. The 14.6 percent drop marked the biggest year-on-year decline since the pandemic began, breaking the previous record of 9.7 percent logged in May last year. In 2020, the number of newborns for the year dropped 2.9 percent from the preceding year, but the figure for the first month of this year fell even more. “The number of pregnancy reports began dropping sharply in May last year,” said a ministry official. “That may explain the decline in births in January, when women who were pregnant around that time gave birth to their children.” Women notify local municipalities after learning of their pregnancies. More than 90 percent of women report their pregnancies by the 11th week after conception, according to the ministry. The number of pregnancy reports plummeted 17.6 percent from the same month a year ago in May 2020, a month after the government issued the nation’s first state of emergency over the pandemic. The year-on-year monthly decline continued until October that year. In 2016, the number of Japanese born in the nation sank below a million for the first time since 1899, when record-keeping on births began. The figure dipped below 900,000 in 2019 to 865,239. The impact on society was so significant that it was dubbed the “860,000 shock.” The figure for births of Japanese in the country last year has yet to be released, but is expected to fall below 850,000. Some estimates show the trend of postponing having children could push this year’s figure to below 800,000.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14302126

0,Suga reluctant to apply stricter measures in virus-hit Miyagi,['By NAOKI KIKUCHI/ Staff Writer'],"March 24, 2021 at 18:55 JST"," Miyagi Prefecture has reached the most serious stage in some indicators concerning the spread of the novel coronavirus, but the central government is reluctant to apply stricter measures to improve the situation there. One official said the hesitancy stems in part from the vagueness of the requirements to take such steps. The concentrated measures listed under the revised special measures law to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic can be put in place to prevent the spread of the virus from forcing the government to declare a state of emergency in a given area. The number of new virus infections has surged in Miyagi, a prefecture in the northern Tohoku region, particularly in the capital of Sendai. The crisis has forced the prefecture to issue a local state of emergency and to renew its anti-virus measures, such as asking drinking establishments to close early from March 25. Miyagi Governor Yoshihiro Murai said he would see how the prefecture handles the situation before he considers asking the central government for help. Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga discussed the Miyagi situation with related Cabinet members, including health minister Norihisa Tamura, at the prime minister’s office on March 23. “The first step is to cut business hours,” sources quoted Suga as saying at the meeting. The prime minister also said he would wait and see the effectiveness of the prefecture’s measures. The central government’s subcommittee on the COVID-19 pandemic has established a four-stage system for six indicators, including the number of new COVID-19 cases and the ratio of available hospital beds, to determine the seriousness of the virus spread in an area. Stage 4 is the most severe, showing an “explosive” growth in infections. The government has indicated that it would basically apply the concentrated measures, which were introduced in February, to areas in the second most severe stage 3 (surge in infections). Under the period when the concentrated measures are applied, the central government gives governors the authority to order noncompliant businesses to reduce their operational hours and impose administrative fines against them. According to Cabinet Secretariat documents, Miyagi Prefecture as of March 21 had reached stage 4 for some of the indicators. But many of the prime minister’s aides are cautious about applying the special measures in the prefecture. “The prefecture is still at a level where other measures can be taken,” a senior official said. The official also said the concentrated measures suddenly emerged as a topic during discussions around December to revise the special measures law, and that more talks are needed to decide on the details, such as procedural steps, before the measures are applied. “They were not fully discussed before they were introduced,” the official said. Some officials also noted that strict measures to cut business hours helped to improve the COVID-19 situations in Hokkaido and Hiroshima city.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14298089

0,New virus cases rising around Japan; Tohoku areas hit hard,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"March 23, 2021 at 17:56 JST"," A surge in COVID-19 cases in two northern prefectures has fueled an overall rebound in novel coronavirus infections in Japan, where the central government’s state of emergency no longer exists. The daily average of newly confirmed infections in Japan for the week through March 2 was 973.3. But the average has been gradually increasing and reached 1,273 for the week through March 21, when the government lifted the final state of emergency for Tokyo and three surrounding prefectures. Health experts said precautions and anti-virus measures are still necessary to prevent a fourth wave of infections. Japan had a record-high daily average of 6,480.9 new cases in the week through Jan. 11, according to a tally compiled by The Asahi Shimbun. Under state of emergency measures, such as shortening business hours of bars and restaurants, the daily average had decreased by about 85 percent by March 2. However, there are signs around the country that the number has bottomed out and is turning upward again. The recent worsening situation has even forced Miyagi and Yamagata prefectures to issue their own states of emergency. Miyagi Prefecture reported 27.2 new COVID-19 patients per 100,000 population in the latest week, the highest figure in Japan. The prefecture thought it had the health crisis under control and stopped asking eating and drinking establishments to cut their business hours. It also restarted sales of meal coupons for the Go To Eat government-subsidized program to support bars and restaurants on Feb. 23. But the number of new COVID-19 patients then jumped at an unprecedented pace, mainly in the prefectural capital of Sendai, and the prefecture was forced to declare a local state of emergency on March 18. The prefectural government will ask eating and drinking establishments that provide companionship services in all areas of Sendai to close early. “We have few choices except to ask them to cut their business hours,” Miyagi Governor Yoshihiro Murai said at a news conference on March 22. “If the current situation continues, we might not be able to save lives that can be saved.” Murai was asked if he will seek the central government’s authority to order bars and restaurants to close early. “I have to consider that choice as a next step,” he said. “First, I would like to wait and see the effectiveness of the prefectural state of emergency and the shortened business hours for seven to 10 days. If we are still in a tough situation, we will likely ask for help from the central government.” Neighboring Yamagata Prefecture confirmed a record-high 31 new COVID-19 cases on March 21. The prefecture and Yamagata city jointly issued a local state of emergency. “The virus might have been brought into the prefecture from Sendai more frequently,” a senior Yamagata prefectural official said. “Lowering the prefecture’s alert levels and the eased caution of residents might have accelerated the virus spread.” Down south, new virus infections have also sharply increased in Okinawa Prefecture. And Tokyo and the neighboring prefectures of Saitama and Chiba are still struggling to reduce their daily numbers of new COVID-19 patients. Atsuo Hamada, a professor of travel health at Tokyo Medical University, said that to prevent a resurgence of the virus, “it is necessary to gradually return to the normal conditions of shortened business hours of bars and restaurants and the reduced frequency of going out for meals.” Yoshihito Niki, a guest professor of infectious diseases at Showa University, called for basic measures, such as expanding the testing capacity and increasing the number of hospital beds for COVID-19 patients. “We need to be fully prepared to bring the infection situation under control even if the number of patients grows higher than that of the third wave.” (This article was written by Shinya Tokushima, Hideoki Kozuki and Tomonori Washida.)",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14294895

1,Scientists devise way to painlessly inject vaccines without needles,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"March 23, 2021 at 08:00 JST"," SUITA, Osaka Prefecture--A researcher holds up a blue plastic medical device, resembling a crafting glue gun, which could one day replace needles as the main delivery method for vaccines. It is mid-January at Osaka University’s Center of Medical Innovation and Translational Research, and the expert is giving a visual demonstration of how the new device works using water in lieu of a vaccine. The experimental tool is designed to set off a charge of gunpowder to administer the DNA vaccine that has been developed in collaboration with the university’s corporate partners, including AnGes Inc., a drug maker based in Ibaraki, Osaka Prefecture. It may seem scary, but when put to use during the lab demonstration, the gunpowder that ignited in the device produced anything but a loud bang. The only sound that could be heard in the room was an electronic beep signaling that the injection procedure was complete. “You must have been surprised because the process finished very quickly,” said a grinning Hironori Nakagami, a health and development medicine professor, who teaches classes at the university backed by third parties. It all sounds like something out of “Star Trek,” but the researchers behind the project believe they have found a way to painlessly inject a vaccine into a patient without needles. The experts say their approach could lead to a painless and more effective method of vaccine delivery that would also be safer for health care workers to administer. The development comes as people in Japan have started receiving vaccines against the novel coronavirus after vaccinations began in the United States, Europe and elsewhere. WORKS LIKE AIRBAGS The device works a little like deploying a car airbag. An electrical charge ignites a tiny amount of gunpowder to generate gas pressure. A piston then moves, sending the vaccine shooting through tiny apertures. When used on a person, it penetrates into the top layers of their skin relatively painlessly. Under the conventional method to deliver a vaccine, a needle needs to be inserted deep into a person’s arm, causing pain and sometimes inducing fear at the prospect. The COVID-19 vaccines already available, including one offered by the U.S. pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc., get injected into a person’s muscle. But this new method, developed in partnership with Osaka-based chemical manufacturer Daicel Corp., uses an intradermal injection. It works by targeting the outer-most layers of the skin, called the epidermis and cutis, which are home to more immune cells. PAINLESS VACCINATIONS Nakagami said that at first, he doubted gunpowder could be used to administer vaccines. But he changed his mind as the research progressed. “The vaccine injection and other medical techniques using needles have not changed drastically over the decades,” he said. “A device free of needles will help to prevent accidents in which health care providers and others mistakenly pierce their own skin with used needles.” According to Nakagami, another advantage of the new technology is that, in some cases, patients “may not feel pain at all.” The researchers also confirmed through experiments that the test vaccine succeeded in significantly stimulating immune cells using anywhere from one-fifth to one-10th of the normal amount needed when injecting it into a muscle. In November last year, a clinical study started at Osaka University Hospital into the safety and effectiveness of the technology. Twenty adults have already received inoculations, and the first round of analysis is expected to be carried out by the end of March. No serious side effects or complaints of pain have been reported yet, although the researchers note they will need to carefully monitor future developments. As it would be difficult for the university alone to carry out a larger-scale clinical trial, it is expected to seek support from businesses and other entities in the future.

Thirty-two percent of respondents said the March 21 end of the state of emergency for the capital and the three neighboring prefectures of Kanagawa, Saitama and Chiba was “appropriate,” while 11 percent said the lifting came “too late,” according to the nationwide telephone survey conducted on March 20 and 21. The approval rating for the Suga Cabinet improved from 34 percent in the February survey to 40 percent, while the disapproval rating fell from 43 percent to 39 percent. Among voters aged 70 or older, the approval rating jumped from 33 percent to 43 percent. The higher approval rating for the Cabinet may stem from more favorable reviews of the government’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Thirty-five percent of respondents gave a “high evaluation” for the government’s response to the health crisis, up from 31 percent in February, while 51 percent gave a “low evaluation,” down from 56 percent. Among supporters of the Cabinet, 61 percent gave high marks and 29 percent gave low marks for the government’s handling of the virus situation. Japan in February started its vaccination program for health care workers and is expected to expand the inoculations to elderly people in April. Sixty-nine percent of respondents gave a “high evaluation” for the government’s vaccination efforts so far, while 29 percent gave a “low evaluation.” Thirty-nine percent said they “want to get vaccinated right away” if it is available, compared with 29 percent in February, while 53 percent said they “want to wait and see how it goes,” down from 62 percent. The number of people who “do not want to get vaccinated” inched down from 8 percent to 7 percent. Among people aged 70 or older, 52 percent said they want the shots right away, according to the latest survey. For a question not related to the virus, 65 percent of respondents said same-sex marriages “should be legalized,” while 22 percent said they “should not.” The Asahi Shimbun In a telephone survey in February 2015, 41 percent of respondents said same-sex marriages “should be legalized,” compared with 37 percent who opposed such a change. However, the data cannot be simply compared because the survey methods were different. Conservative lawmakers of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party are seen as the main opponents of recognizing gay marriages. But according to the survey, 57 percent of LDP supporters said same-sex marriages “should be legalized,” outpacing the 32 percent who said they “should not.” The March 20-21 survey contacted 1,155 fixed telephone numbers of households with at least one eligible voter and 2,091 mobile phone numbers of voters, both selected at random by computer.

If they refuse to follow the order, they could face administrative fines of up to 300,000 yen ($2,750). “We wanted to avoid giving business operators the impression that they can keep operating longer than requested,” a metropolitan government official said. “More businesses may defy the request if we do not issue an order.” The Tokyo metropolitan government asked bars, restaurants and karaoke parlors to close by 8 p.m. based on Article 24 of the special measures law after the central government issued a state of emergency for the capital and three neighboring prefectures in January. In a subsequent investigation, the metropolitan government found that 129 outlets were not cooperating with the request. It again asked them to close early based on Article 45 of the special measures law. It also warned those businesses that it would order them to shorten their operating hours on March 15 or later if they failed to comply with the second request. The special measures law allows prefectural authorities to publish the names of establishments that are ordered to close early. But the metropolitan government decided not to disclose the names of the 27 bars and restaurants because doing so could draw crowds to those places and raise the risk of infections. The metropolitan government will dispatch officials to the targeted establishments to check if they are following the order until March 21, when the state of emergency will be lifted. The metropolitan government will notify a court of any noncompliance found in its on-site investigations. Tokyo may issue additional early closure orders to other outlets before March 21, an official said.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14283402

But patients must be hospitalized with a mental disability or possess a mental or intellectual disability certificate to get on the list. In December, the panel refrained from including people with mental or intellectual disabilities on its priority list for vaccinations. But the panel changed its mind after countries other than Japan reported that such people who contract the novel coronavirus are at higher risk of dying or being hospitalized. Related domestic academic societies also requested the health ministry add people with mental or intellectual disabilities to the list. Their addition to the list will add about 2.1 million people to the number of people with underlying conditions eligible for priority vaccinations and raise the estimated number of 8.2 million such people to 10.3 million, according to the health ministry.

Some government officials said there was no choice but to lift the state of emergency as scheduled on March 21 for Tokyo and three surrounding prefectures because local residents and businesses were “fatigued” by the crisis and more likely to ignore requests by authorities to take anti-virus precautions. The government panel of experts dealing with the pandemic gave its consent on March 18 to the proposal to lift the state of emergency on March 21. At the meeting, Yasutoshi Nishimura, the state minister in charge of economic revitalization who also leads the government’s handling of the pandemic, pointed to the 80-percent reduction in new COVID-19 cases from peak levels in Tokyo. He also cited improvements in the tight health care situations in Chiba and Saitama prefectures, where hospital bed usage by COVID-19 patients has fallen to under 40 percent of capacity. In addition, Nishimura laid out measures to prevent a resurgence in new COVID-19 cases, such as the start in the near future of testing for the disease to pick up early signs of a rebound as well as a more detailed study this month of infection routes. The government task force handling the pandemic formally decided on March 18 to lift the state of emergency. The end of the state of emergency will allow for the easing of some infection prevention measures. For example, bars and restaurants in the four Tokyo area prefectures will be asked to close operations at 9 p.m., one hour later than the current request. But experts who attended the March 17 meeting of the health ministry’s advisory panel pointed to disturbing trends in prefectures where the state of emergency had been lifted earlier. They said it may be too early to do the same for the greater Tokyo metropolitan area. After the meeting, Takaji Wakita, the head of the National Institute of Infectious Diseases who chairs the advisory panel, said some members viewed the increase in new cases in major urban areas as a sign of a rebound. Another panel member said the current measures were inadequate because the number of new cases had to be further reduced. Toshio Nakagawa, president of the Japan Medical Association, suggested that concentrated measures to prevent a spread of COVID-19 should be announced for the four Tokyo-area prefectures at the same time as when the state of emergency is lifted. The revised special measures law to deal with the novel coronavirus pandemic took effect from February to introduce ways to control the spread of infections when a state of emergency was not in place. The revised law also contained penalties against businesses that do not comply with requests to shorten business hours after a state of emergency is lifted. Pointing to the situation in Tokyo, Nakagawa said, “There has been a widening of the areas where the danger of a rebound has heightened.” Some officials said current measures are not being followed as closely because residents and businesses are weary of complying. “Even if the state of emergency was again extended, the physical and psychological ability of the people to continue with such efforts will disappear,” a high-ranking administration official said. “The economic limit has also been reached in asking bars and restaurants to shorten hours.” Such noncompliance appeared to be supported by data compiled by Tokyo-based Agoop Corp., a Softbank Group subsidiary that tracks people’s movements through GPS data on their mobile phones. Foot traffic around 8 p.m. between March 12 and 14 had increased by 35 percent in the Shibuya area in comparison to the weekend that had the lowest number of people out and about after the state of emergency was declared, according to the data. Similarly, there was a 34-percent increase in the ritzy Ginza district, a 29-percent increase in Yokohama and a 26-percent increase in Shinjuku, the data showed.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14280137

1,New subsidy program drafted to aid struggling families,['By HARUNA ISHIKAWA/ Staff Writer'],"March 17, 2021 at 18:45 JST"," The central government announced it will provide cash handouts to families that are struggling financially amid the COVID-19 pandemic, including two-parent households, under a new program. Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga stressed the need for cash payouts to low-income households with children. “The pandemic has dealt a heavy blow to the employment of women and nonregular workers,” Suga said at a meeting of relevant Cabinet ministers on March 16. “We also need to tackle the problems of a rise in suicides, as well as loneliness and social isolation, head on.” The government will use more than 500 billion yen ($4.58 billion) in reserve funds from the budget for the current fiscal year to fund the new subsidy program. The money will also fund other support measures for nonregular workers and those who have poor job security. This is the third time the government is providing cash payouts to struggling families amid the pandemic. But under the first and second cash-handout programs, only single-parent households were eligible to receive 50,000 yen for their first child and 30,000 yen for each subsequent child. The new program will also cover two-parent households and households with children that are receiving the child care allowance or are exempt from residential taxes. The amount will be 50,000 yen per child, regardless of the number of children in each household. The government plans to start providing cash handouts by the end of March at the earliest, after it sets requirements for the program and fleshes out other details. The government will also extend the deadline for accepting applications for two types of interest-free special loans that do not require guarantors. It is pushing back the date by three months to the end of June. One of the loans offers up to 200,000 yen to people who need money to cover living expenses. The other provides the same amount in loans per month for up to nine months to those who have lost their jobs. The government also decided that households will not have to pay some or all of the loans back, depending on the period they are exempt from paying residential taxes. The government made it clear that it is also accepting applications for those loans from part-time workers who have seen their incomes decline from their workplaces scaling back shifts, and single parents who are receiving fewer child-support payments from their divorced spouses.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14276648
0,Suga: State of emergency for Greater Tokyo to end on March 21,['By AYAKO NAKADA/ Staff Writer'],"March 17, 2021 at 18:04 JST"," The state of emergency for Tokyo and three neighboring prefectures imposed over the COVID-19 pandemic will be lifted as scheduled on March 21, Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga said on March 17. Suga discussed lifting the state of emergency with Norihisa Tamura, the health minister, and Yasutoshi Nishimura, the state minister in charge of economic revitalization who also heads the central government’s efforts in dealing with COVID-19, according to several government sources. Suga stated his decision to lift the state of emergency during that meeting on March 17, which followed a session of the health ministry's panel of experts. Suga said that a final decision will be made on March 18 after the meeting of an expert panel. Tokyo and neighboring Kanagawa, Saitama and Chiba prefectures have been under a state of emergency since Jan. 8. During it, bars and restaurants have been asked to close early and audience limits have been in place for events. While those restrictions will be gradually relaxed, some restrictions are expected to remain in place for the four prefectures. The central government had sought to bring down the level of COVID-19 infections spreading from the worst level, stage 4, meaning cases were explosively increasing, to at least the second-highest level, stage 3. As of March 15, Tokyo and the three prefectures were at stage 3 or lower for five of the six benchmarks used to classify the stage infections are spreading at, according to figures compiled by the Cabinet Secretariat. A major factor behind the government officials' decision to lift the state of emergency was that fewer COVID-19 patients are being hospitalized. Suga, during the March 15 Upper House Budget Committee session, said that the figures for new COVID-19 cases had dropped to the equivalent of the stage 2 level. However, the daily average over the course of a week rose slightly for Tokyo and Saitama compared to the previous week. Despite some experts having urged caution about lifting the state of emergency, one Cabinet minister said, “If the state of emergency is not lifted now, there is no telling when that would be possible. We would have no measures to take if we did not lift it because cases increased from now.” Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike has not come out clearly on whether the state of emergency should be lifted, but Saitama Governor Motohiro Ono has raised doubts about lifting it. Government officials, including Chief Cabinet Secretary Katsunobu Kato, however, have made clear that any decision on lifting it would cover all four prefectures simultaneously. Because of concerns among experts and some government officials about a possible rebound in new COVID-19 cases, the central government plans to strengthen infection prevention measures, including securing an adequate number of hospital beds, conducting periodic tests at facilities for senior citizens, dealing with variant strains of the novel coronavirus and testing asymptomatic individuals visiting entertainment districts.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14276698

Statistics on the virus situation in the capital support their concerns. “More than two months have passed since we have been screaming, ‘State of emergency!’” a high-ranking official with the metropolitan government said. “People may be relaxing somewhat because the current situation has become the new normal. There are no signs the number of new cases is declining.” Even Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike acknowledged on March 14 that the virus numbers have slightly increased after a decline. March 15 marked the seventh straight day when the daily figure for new COVID-19 cases in the capital was higher than the number for the same day of the previous week. For the week ending March 15, the daily average was 287.6, a 13.5-percent increase over the previous week. It was the first time after February for the week-on-week average to rise by more than 10 percent. There are other signs Tokyo residents are no longer heeding requests from the metropolitan government to take measures to prevent infections. For the week until March 8, the ratio of infection routes tied to get-togethers and parties among friends and colleagues jumped to 4.5 percent from the 3.8 percent of the previous week. At a March 12 meeting of the metropolitan government’s panel of experts, one member pointed out, “There has been an increase in foot traffic at some major entertainment areas in comparison to when the state of emergency was issued on Jan. 8.” And the trend is not limited to salaried employees working for companies in the capital’s Shinbashi district. On March 13, the Tokyo Metropolitan Bokutoh Hospital announced that five staff members, including doctors and nurses, tested positive for the novel coronavirus. The five gathered on March 4 at an “izakaya” Japanese-style pub near the hospital for food and drinks. They then went to the home of a doctor for more drinks. None of the staff members wore a face mask during the extended session, according to the hospital. The trend concerning positive COVID-19 test results is also troubling. At the peak on Jan. 7, 14.5 percent of tests came back positive. The indicator is one sign of the extent of community infections. While the figure dropped to 3.9 percent on Feb. 19, it has remained stuck at the 3-percent level for about three weeks. POSITIVE DATA FOR HOSPITALS However, there are signs that the health care situation in Tokyo has improved. One goal among metropolitan government officials is to lower the figures of the six benchmarks used to evaluate the pace of new infections. The benchmarks are classified under a four-level system, with the most serious stage 4 indicating an “explosive” growth in infections. The metropolitan government’s panel of experts has set the goal of reducing the benchmarks to stage 2 by March 21, the current deadline for the state of emergency for Tokyo and three neighboring prefectures. As of March 15, a total of 2,628 patients were resting and recuperating from COVID-19. The figure is much higher than 2,088, the cutoff point for stage 2 in that benchmark. But the number of hospitalized patients—1,270—is close to the 1,261 for stage 2. And the figure for COVID-19 patients with serious symptoms has dipped under the 255 number for stage 2 and now stands at 251. However, the panel meeting on March 12 pointed out that the pace at which the number of hospitalized patients is declining has slowed. Members noted that the figure has been at a high level since early January, meaning there has been an extensive effect on providing medical care for illnesses besides COVID-19. NEIGHBORS SPLIT The infection trends in the three neighboring prefectures of Kanagawa, Saitama and Chiba have led to differing views about whether the state of emergency should end as scheduled on March 21. For the week ending March 14, Kanagawa and Chiba recorded a decline in new COVID-19 cases over the previous week, but the figure increased in Saitama. And while the hospital bed usage ratio for Saitama and Chiba has moved out of the stage 4 level, the figures are still around 40 percent. Kanagawa is approaching the stage 2 level of under 20 percent, with its current ratio at 25 percent. Saitama Governor Motohiro Ono raised doubts about asking for a lifting of the state of emergency, saying there were signs of a rebound in new infections. However, Kanagawa Governor Yuji Kuroiwa said he was inclined to have the state of emergency lifted, pointing out that the infection situation had eased in recent days in his prefecture.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14273567

Suga is expected to receive the second dose of the Pfizer vaccine three weeks later, which will be in early April, just in time for his official trip to Washington, D.C.

1,Kono won't prioritize insulin syringes to use in COVID-19 shots,['By JUNYA SAKAMOTO/ Staff Writer'],"March 12, 2021 at 16:46 JST"," The government “will not recommend” that insulin syringes for diabetes patients be used for vaccinations against COVID-19, vaccination minister Taro Kono said on March 11. Kono, speaking to reporters, addressed mounting concerns from diabetes patients over the limited stock of insulin syringes and the possibility they would be used for COVID-19 vaccinations. Uji-Tokushukai Medical Center in Uji, Kyoto Prefecture, on March 8 announced that seven doses of the precious vaccine could be extracted from one vial using an insulin syringe, instead of five with typical syringes or six with special syringes. “We should never let there be a shortage of insulin syringes that are needed for their initial purpose,” Kono said, responding to a question. But he also said, “If there are extra insulin syringes, it won’t be any problem to use them for the vaccinations.” Kono had said that vaccinations with insulin syringes were “more than welcome,” at a news conference on March 9. Kono also said on March 11 that the government will not procure insulin syringes but will speed up securing syringes with which six doses can be taken from one vial of the vaccine developed by U.S. pharmaceutical company Pfizer Inc., currently in use in Japan. Medical institutions can still decide whether to use insulin syringes to administer COVID-19 vaccines in certain situations.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14262433

The cases had been reported in 21 prefectures, including Tokyo, ministry officials said March 10. The ministry confirmed the number and the variants by collecting cases that the National Institute of Infectious Diseases (NIID) and other institutions conducted genomic analyses on. Of the 271 cases, 260, or 96 percent, involved the British variant, while eight were caused by the South African variant and three came from the Brazilian variant. “A process of variants outpacing the existing novel coronavirus has already started, and the variants will become dominant sooner or later,” Shigeru Omi, who heads the central government’s panel to respond to the pandemic, said at the Lower House Committee on Health, Welfare and Labor on March 10. Omi urged the government to strengthen testing and monitoring of situation concerning the variants. Osaka Prefecture had reported the most variant cases by March 9, with 62, and all were caused by the British strain. Saitama Prefecture followed with 41, including 40 of the British variant and one from the Brazilian variant. Hyogo Prefecture confirmed 38 infections of the British variant while Niigata Prefecture reported 32 cases of the same strain. In Kanagawa Prefecture, 22 cases with variants--18 British and four South African--were found. Kyoto Prefecture reported 19 infections of the British variant, while Tokyo confirmed 14 cases of the British strain. Additionally, 74 cases of infections with variants had been found at airport quarantine stations as of March 9. A World Health Organization report on March 9 said the British COVID-19 variant, which has been found in 111 countries, is 1.36 to 1.75 times more infectious than the previous strains. According to the NIID’s risk assessment report released on March 8, most of the people on Japan who contracted the British variant have no history of traveling abroad. The strain has persisted in some areas, and the ratio of British variant among all COVID-19 cases in Japan could increase like in other countries, the assessment said.

1,Kyoto hospital: Insulin syringe can handle 7 COVID-19 shots,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"March 9, 2021 at 18:54 JST"," A Kyoto hospital has found a way to squeeze one or even two more shots out of a precious vial of COVID-19 vaccine by utilizing a commonly used syringe for diabetes patients. Uji-Tokushukai Medical Center in Uji, Kyoto Prefecture, on March 8 announced that seven doses can be taken from one vial using an insulin syringe, instead of five or six through other syringes. Taro Kono, a state minister who is in charge of the nation's vaccination program, welcomed the news, although health ministry officials were more cautious. “That is tremendous,"" Kono said at a news conference after a Cabinet meeting on March 9. ""I want them to push it hard. I encourage more originality and ingenuity like this one."" However, a health ministry official said, “We do not reject the method, but we do not recommend it, either.” The central government in early February admitted that it did not secure enough of a special syringe needed to extract six doses from one vial of the vaccine and had no choice but to waste one dose for each vial. But the hospital in Kyoto said the total doses per vial increase by utilizing a syringe already in stock for diabetes patients. Inoculation using the vaccine developed by U.S. pharmaceutical company Pfizer Inc. has already begun among health care workers nationwide in Japan. One vial of the Pfizer vaccine contains six doses, according to the company. A Pfizer public relations official emphasized what the company's directions say, in that ""six doses can be taken per vial.” But a syringe mostly available in Japan can inject only five people per vial and the needle still contains some vaccine after injection. The leftover fluid is disposed of after each use. Atsushi Sueyoshi, who heads Uji-Tokushukai Medical Center, said, “Five doses per vial will not cover all employees who want to get inoculated.” ""Staff discussed the problem and found that an insulin syringe can inject seven people and would not leave much of the vaccine compared to the special syringe for the (Pfizer vaccine),” Sueyoshi said. The syringe is used to inject insulin hypodermically. The length of the injection needle is short and about one-half the length of a typical syringe for COVID-19 vaccine, which is injected into the muscle. Sueyoshi said the cushion of fat that resides just under the skin of Japanese people is thinner than that of Europeans, making it possible to administer an injection into the muscle by an insulin syringe. Sueyoshi said the hospital has already inoculated staff using an insulin syringe after measuring the thickness of their subcutaneous fat by ultrasonography. Health Minister Norihisa Tamura warned that the short insulin syringe needle poses a drawback. “It can only be used for those who do not have much fat and the needle can reach their muscle,"" he said. Tamura urged medical institutions to utilize an ultrasonic exam such as Uji-Tokushukai is doing to ensure that they can administer the vaccination safely and properly. Michiaki Hata, who heads the hospital’s critical care center and is in charge of vaccinating hospital staff, said, “We have made sure that a needle breakage does not occur by a basic action of injection. “I think the method can be widely used,” he said. A 53-year-old nurse of the hospital who received the vaccine via an insulin syringe on March 8 said, “I didn’t feel any pain. It was no problem. I don’t think we should waste the valuable vaccine.” (This article was compiled from reports written by Ryosuke Nonaka and Naoyuki Himeno.)",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14253760

1,Health ministry seeks to shore up hospital beds for new virus surge,['By NAOYUKI HIMENO/ Staff Writer'],"March 9, 2021 at 16:17 JST"," The health ministry is planning to call on prefectural authorities to secure more hospital beds for COVID-19 patients to prepare for a new surge in infections and stave off shortages. It aims to secure about twice the number set aside for coronavirus patients at the height of the third wave of infections that started late last year. The ministry’s latest move follows reports from Japan’s overstretched local health care systems that they have been inundated with patients since new cases shot up at year end and in early January. For example, by the middle of January, more than 80 percent of the hospital beds in the capital designated for coronavirus patients were occupied. The Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare urged prefectural authorities in February to expand the health care systems’ capacity by having hospitals in local areas divide their roles in caring for patients depending on the seriousness of their conditions. The ministry said university hospitals, which have advanced medical equipment, should care for gravely ill patients, while public-supported hospitals that play a core role in dealing with patients in local areas should focus on those with moderate symptoms. The current plans for allocating beds for COVID-19 patients in the prefectures were drawn up last June, based on data from the first wave of infections--which was far lower than the latest wave. Hospitals could not adequately respond to the third wave because it was not made clear how they should divide their roles in caring for patients, officials said. Under the ministry’s new recommendation, hospitals and local authorities are expected to discuss how to divvy up individual hospitals’ roles and determine the number of beds needed based on the spread of infections. Small and midsize hospitals, which typically have limited resources for dealing with infectious diseases, will be asked to accept patients who have recovered from COVID-19 well enough to be discharged from other facilities. The ministry also plans to enlist clinics and home-visit nursing stations to assist in closely monitoring patients with mild cases who are self-isolating at their homes or hotels. At the third wave’s peak, thousands of patients in Tokyo were unable to access care at hospitals as they were overwhelmed by patients. The new COVID-19 preparedness plan aims to expand the abilities of health care systems to handle patient hospitalizations and recoveries, even if novel coronavirus cases double from their peak during the third wave. Hospital and local officials, as well as local doctors’ associations, will need to fully discuss the matter to hash out a workable plan.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14253372

0,Suga: Averting rebound in virus cases key over next 2 weeks,['By AYAKO NAKADA/ Staff Writer'],"March 6, 2021 at 16:32 JST"," Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga pledged to dramatically expand nationwide vaccinations for COVID-19 by the end of April as the government forges ahead with efforts to prevent a rebound in cases in the greater Tokyo metropolitan area. Suga, in a March 5 news conference, also apologized for extending the state of emergency related to the pandemic for two weeks for Tokyo and its three neighboring prefectures of Kanagawa, Saitama and Chiba until March 21. “What I have to do is to prevent a rebound and to allow for the lifting of the state of emergency,” he said. At an earlier government task force meeting where the formal decision was made to extend the measures originally slated to end March 7, Suga touched upon benchmarks that show the situation at the hospitals treating COVID-19 patients still leave no room for complacency. Suga said testing for COVID-19 would be expanded to prevent infection clusters by pinpointing the source. The measures will include testing at about 30,000 facilities for senior citizens as well as for those who may not have obvious symptoms in entertainment districts in urban centers. Describing vaccines against COVID-19 as a “ray of hope,” Suga said vaccinations would be expanded widely by the end of April. He said a meeting of Cabinet ministers tasked with finding solutions to the health crisis would be held before the end of March to consider steps to support those vulnerable to becoming isolated from the rest of society, such as women in jobs that offer little security and single parents. Those factors are behind a sharp increase in suicides among women. Shigeru Omi, the chairman of the government’s panel of experts, also attended the news conference along with Suga and stressed that preventing a rebound in novel coronavirus infections is crucial. “The greater Tokyo metropolitan area has a higher possibility of a rebound than other regions,” Omi said. “Measures will need to be strengthened over the next two weeks to accomplish this.” In other developments, the governors of the four prefectures that will continue to remain under the state of emergency held a video conference on the afternoon of March 5. They agreed to ask local residents to refrain from gatherings to enjoy cherry blossoms or attend parties related to personnel transfers around the start of the new fiscal year from April 1. They also agreed to continue with requests to bars and restaurants to close their doors at 8 p.m. But they could not agree on benchmarks that would have to be met before they asked the central government to lift the state of emergency. The Tokyo metropolitan government decided not to establish benchmarks due to fears that such a move might tie their hands when the time came to make a decision. Kanagawa Prefecture decided not to set up benchmarks, but Saitama Prefecture came up with its own criteria, while Chiba Prefecture said it would refer to the six benchmarks established by the central government’s panel of experts.

0,Experts question timing of new deadline for state of emergency,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"March 5, 2021 at 14:55 JST"," Government leaders apologized to the public for the extended COVID-19 state of emergency in the greater Tokyo metropolitan area while some experts raised concerns about the timing of the new deadline. The central government’s panel of experts on March 5 approved the proposal to continue the state of emergency for the novel coronavirus for two weeks for Tokyo and its neighboring prefectures of Kanagawa, Saitama and Chiba beyond the March 7 deadline. The state of emergency, in place since Jan. 7, is now scheduled to end on March 21 for those areas. A government task force dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic was to formally approve the decision later on March 5, and Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga was expected to hold a news conference to explain the extension. “I frankly apologize for reaching the conclusion that there is a need to extend (the state of emergency) for about two weeks because there are still serious barriers existing, such as the tight situation among hospital beds set aside for COVID-19 patients,” Suga said at the Upper House Budget Committee on the morning of March 5. He added that every effort would be made to contain the spread of infections as soon as possible. Yasutoshi Nishimura, the state minister for economic revitalization who is in charge of the central government’s effort to deal with the pandemic, said at the experts’ meeting, “The pace at which new infections is decreasing in the greater Tokyo metropolitan area is slowing, and there is a need to ensure that the hospital bed (usage ratio) decreases in a steady manner.” Health minister Norihisa Tamura also attended the meeting and apologized for causing further trouble to citizens for two weeks. He added that additional steps would be taken for vaccinations and dealing with variant strains of the coronavirus. Some experts questioned why the extension is for only two weeks. If the state of emergency is lifted on March 21, there would likely be an increase in gatherings related to personnel transfers at companies in line with the new fiscal year, which starts on April 1, they said. That period would also coincide with the blooming of cherry blossoms in the metropolitan area. If the state of emergency is lifted, more people could feel it is safe to gather and drink under the flowers. Other experts conducted simulations of infection trends depending on when the state of emergency is lifted. According to one finding, if the state of emergency is lifted on March 21, the increase in new infections in Tokyo would be somewhat gradual. But Chiba Prefecture would see a sevenfold increase by June from the level on March 21, requiring another declaration of a state of emergency. The simulation study was conducted by Taisuke Nakata, an associate professor of economics at the University of Tokyo, and Daisuke Fujii, a specially appointed lecturer at the same university’s Economics Faculty. They also concluded that the extent in which requests are relaxed to shorten business hours and limit audience numbers would be crucial in decreasing the economic impact while restraining new COVID-19 cases. One prediction was that new cases in Tokyo would be only half of the peak figure if the state of emergency was lifted on March 7. The cumulative number of fatalities would also be about 2,100, or 700 fewer than the figure if the state of emergency was not extended. But extending the state of emergency for two weeks will increase the economic loss by about 160 billion yen ($1.5 billion), equivalent to about 0.16 percent of Tokyo’s gross domestic product. The economists’ simulation predicts Tokyo will have the most gradual increase in new cases, and the pace will be higher for the other three prefectures. “Unlike February, when the focus was on whether to lift or extend the state of emergency, the situation has now entered the important stage of risk management,” Nakata said. He said that would involve coordinating how to relax requests regarding business hours and event audiences while monitoring trends in new COVID-19 cases.

0,Sources: Suga to extend state of emergency for the Tokyo area,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"March 3, 2021 at 19:05 JST"," Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga has decided to extend the COVID-19 state of emergency for four prefectures in the Tokyo metropolitan area for two weeks beyond the March 7 deadline, several government sources said. Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike and her counterparts from Kanagawa, Saitama and Chiba prefectures have all warned that the pace of decline in new COVID-19 cases has slowed and that a resurgence in cases could be on the horizon. The governors discussed the situation at an online meeting on the afternoon of March 3. Suga has been waffling on whether he will lift the state of emergency for the four prefectures on March 7. Although he has pointed to the reductions in new infections, he has also expressed caution about the continuing tight situation at medical care facilities. A consensus has apparently been reached that any decision on the state of emergency would cover all four prefectures simultaneously, even though the central government’s six benchmarks used to determine the infection situation vary among the four prefectures. The government lifted the state of emergency for six other prefectures on Feb. 28, but the Tokyo area governors have continued to express pessimism about the COVID-19 situation in their jurisdictions. On March 2, Chiba Governor Kensaku Morita said it would be “extremely difficult” to lift the state of emergency on March 7, given the inconsistent pattern in new COVID-19 cases. The previous day, Chiba Prefecture, which lies just east of the capital, recorded 128 new cases, a figure that was even higher than the tally for more densely populated Tokyo. The benchmark regarding hospital bed usage for COVID-19 patients in Chiba Prefecture has also been hovering around the 50-percent level considered a sign the jurisdiction remains in the most serious stage 4 level in terms of the spreading of infections. Morita also noted that the increase of community infections in his prefecture left open the risk of infection clusters at facilities such as retirement homes. On Feb. 24, Chiba Prefecture issued its own warning about a new surge in infections after the average of new cases for a five-day period exceeded the figure for the previous week. Saitama Governor Motohiro Ono on March 1 also said he was not confident the state of emergency could be lifted for his prefecture, north of Tokyo. The hospital bed usage ratio has fallen under 50 percent, pushing Saitama out of stage 4 for that benchmark. But the figure remains above 40 percent, meaning it has still not moved out of the second most serious stage 3. Koike also said on March 2 that a further request to thoroughly implement infection prevention measures would have to be made before the state of emergency could be lifted. The Tokyo metropolitan government has set its own target of reducing the weekly average of new COVID-19 cases to 70 percent of the previous week.

0,Crowds return outside Osaka after anti-virus measures eased,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"March 2, 2021 at 19:23 JST"," People are flocking back to entertainment districts outside Osaka now that the state of emergency is lifted and requests for bars and restaurants to close early have been withdrawn in some areas. Streets in the city of Suita, Osaka Prefecture, were once again crowded in front of Esaka Station on Osaka Metro Co.’s Midosuji Line on March 1. The city is among the areas no longer targeted by the prefecture's request for restaurants and bars to close early, and many company employees were seen heading to “izakaya” pubs from the station there even after 8 p.m. A seafood restaurant in front of the station resumed operating until midnight for the first time in about three months. “I was worried about a possible extension of the state of emergency,” said Ryotaro Onishi, who heads the eatery. “But I can’t be overjoyed at the lifting of the emergency as the situation remains uncertain.” A 47-year-old company employee drinking alcohol with his two friends from Osaka city shortly after 9 p.m. at an izakaya said he is relieved that he can finally go out in the evening again. “This is my first time drinking at a pub in a while,” the man said. “It’s like my life returned to normal. I am really enjoying it.” The central government lifted the state of emergency on March 1, the second since last spring, for Osaka, Kyoto, Hyogo and three other prefectures a week earlier than scheduled. The measure, however, remains in place for Tokyo and three neighboring prefectures. Eating and drinking establishments in Osaka, Kyoto and Hyogo prefectures had been asked to close by 8 p.m. for months, but they can now remain open until 9 p.m. The early closure requests are still in effect across Kyoto and Hyogo, while Osaka Prefecture withdrew the request for its jurisdiction--except for Osaka city. The number of new COVID-19 cases in Osaka city stopped rising a week after Nov. 27 last year, when Osaka Prefecture began asking establishments that serve alcohol in the city’s Kita and Chuo wards to close early. But the number has remained roughly 1.2 times higher than the figure for the previous week outside the city. Some voiced concerns about the measures ending at a meeting of the Osaka prefectural government’s expert panel on the pandemic. They worried that lifting the prefecture’s early closure request for areas other than the city could help spread infections in the non-targeted regions. DATA SHOWS NIGHTTIME CROWDS ARE BACK The number of crowds is increasing, especially during the evening, around train stations and entertainment districts in major cities, following the lifting of the state of emergency in the six prefectures, according to a data analysis by The Asahi Shimbun. The uptick in the numbers raises concerns over a possible resurgence of infections. The Asahi Shimbun analyzed weekend foot traffic between 9 p.m. and 10 p.m. from Feb. 26 through Feb. 28, using smartphone location data by Softbank Group Corp. affiliate Agoop Corp. The results showed that pedestrian traffic has significantly increased in many major cities compared to the smallest weekend crowds recorded since January, when the second state of emergency was issued. Foot traffic was up 42 percent in the Umeda district of Osaka Prefecture, 39 percent in Yokohama, 36 percent in Tokyo’s Shibuya district, 35 percent in the Tenjin district of Fukuoka Prefecture, 29 percent in Kyoto, and 18 percent in Kobe’s Sannomiya district.

0,Suga to wait for ‘last minute’ to decide on state of emergency,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"March 2, 2021 at 18:58 JST"," Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga showed more caution about lifting the COVID-19 state of emergency for the greater Tokyo area after opposition lawmakers and governors warned about a possible rebound in virus infections. “I would like to wait and see how the infectious disease situation goes until last minute,” Suga said at the Lower House Budget Committee on March 2 about the state of emergency. The state of emergency is scheduled to end on March 7 for Tokyo and the three surrounding prefectures of Chiba, Kanagawa and Saitama. It was lifted for six other prefectures on Feb. 28. Suga on March 1 appeared eager to remove the final prefectures from the state of emergency. He reiterated the achievements of the anti-virus measures taken so far. “We put a heavy burden on people by declaring the state of emergency, but the number of new infection cases dropped by more than 80 percent,” he said at the Lower House Budget Committee. “We achieved tangible results.” He added, “We will continue to fully implement anti-virus measures, such as shortening business hours of restaurants and bars, to lift the state of emergency across the nation as scheduled on March 7.” However, opposition party lawmakers urged Suga to exercise caution because health experts have warned that the virus could start spreading widely again. The number of new COVID-19 cases in Tokyo has dropped, but the rate of decline has shown signs of leveling off. “We should lift the state of emergency bit by bit to prevent a rebound from happening,” Yukio Edano, leader of the main opposition Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan (CDP), said. Some of the cautious experts are on the central government’s advisory panel that was set up to deal with the health crisis. Kazunori Yamanoi, a CDP lawmaker, called on Suga to listen to these experts. “I would like you to answer that you will respect the opinions of the advisory board when you make a decision on whether to lift the state of emergency,” he said. Suga responded by again mentioning the results of the anti-virus measures taken in the capital area. “Tokyo and the three other prefectures have cleared almost all the criteria to lift the state of emergency,” Suga said. “I will make the final decision.” Suga has come under heavy criticism for his response to the novel coronavirus pandemic. He drew confusion by urging the public to take measures to prevent the spread of the virus while promoting domestic tourism through the Go To Travel subsidy campaign. The Go To projects, which were intended to help local businesses and economies hit hard by the pandemic, were eventually suspended. Suga was also criticized as being too late in closing the border to international travelers. “Suga looks at things too optimistically,” Edano said. The opposition leader asked Suga to strengthen restrictions on entry into Japan to prevent other variant strains of the virus from flowing into the country, noting that the British variant has already spread here. Edano proposed that people entering Japan should be isolated at hotels near airports for about 10 days and be required to take multiple polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests. Suga responded: “We are now asking people coming to Japan from countries where variant strains are spreading to isolate themselves (at facilities prepared by quarantine offices) for three days from their arrival. We also ask them to undergo additional tests on the third day.” The prime minister showed reluctance to accept Edano’s proposal on tightening border-control measures. “There are limitations in terms of necessary personnel and material resources, such as quarantine officers and accommodation facilities,” Suga said. Chiba Governor Kensaku Morita and Saitama Governor Motohiro Ono both said on March 1 that any decision on the state of emergency must be made carefully. In Chiba Prefecture, 128 new COVID-19 cases were confirmed on March 1, exceeding the figure of 121 for Tokyo. “If Chiba continues to mark more than 100 new daily cases, it will be difficult to lift the state of emergency on March 7,” Morita said at a news conference. Saitama Prefecture confirmed 97 new infections on Feb. 28, an increase from the tally a week earlier. “I am not convinced yet that the state of emergency can be lifted in Saitama Prefecture, and I want to make the judgment carefully,” Ono said. He also noted that the decline in infections for his prefecture is also leveling off. “The number of new infection cases is bottoming out or dropping at a slower speed,” Ono said. Japan reported 699 new infections and 51 COVID-19 deaths nationwide on March 1.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14233639

The doses of the vaccine developed by U.S. pharmaceutical company Pfizer Inc. and its German partner BioNTech were being stored at a health care facility that has started the inoculation process. The Pfizer vaccine is supposed to be kept at around minus 70 degrees, but the temperature inside the broken freezer rose to 27 degrees, the ministry said. As the result, about 1,000 doses were wasted. An employee of the facility noticed something was wrong on the morning of March 1. After checking records, the employee confirmed the temperature inside the freezer had gradually risen since after 11 p.m. on Feb. 26. The company that delivered the freezer will investigate the cause after replacing the broken freezer on March 2. The health care facility has already finished the first round of inoculations of eligible medical workers. The ministry will arrange an additional delivery of the vaccines so that facility staff can administer the second shots to the workers as scheduled. There had been no other reports of malfunctioning freezers for the vaccine as of March 1, the ministry said. The prime minister’s office on the evening of March 1 posted a message on its Twitter account, announcing that the central government will ship “one box of vaccines each” to all municipalities in the nation in the week of April 26. These shipments are intended to cover eligible elderly people. If the special syringes that can deliver six doses per vial are used, one box can inoculate 585 people, who would receive two shots each.

0,Prefectures urge stronger virus measures after emergency lifted,['By NAMI HAMADA/ Staff Writer'],"February 28, 2021 at 14:45 JST"," Prefectural governors across Japan are calling on the central government to implement stringent measures to prevent a COVID-19 resurgence after a state of emergency for Osaka, Kyoto and four other prefectures is lifted one week early from March. They are also seeking economic assistance for prefectures not covered by the emergency declaration, citing local industries battered by the public health crisis. They plan to compile the requests into a report to submit to the central government. At a Feb. 27 online meeting on their response to the COVID-19 scare, members of the National Governors’ Association agreed that “optimism is not allowed” over the future course of the pandemic as the Tokyo metropolitan area, the country’s main hot spot, remains under a state of emergency. The governors urged the government to caution the public to remain vigilant against the virus based on lessons learned through the third wave of novel coronavirus infections since autumn and enforce strict anti-virus measures even after the emergency is lifted for the six prefectures from March 1. Aside from Osaka and Kyoto, the other prefectures are Hyogo, Aichi, Gifu and Fukuoka. Tokyo and the adjacent prefectures of Kanagawa, Saitama and Chiba will continue to be covered by the emergency at least until March 7. The governors also called on the government to expand eligibility for relief assistance and provide economic aid to prefectures not placed under the emergency to help sustain local industries and secure employment. The prefectures not covered by the emergency and businesses that were not asked to close early in return for relief payouts are also experiencing “serious economic consequences due to the pandemic,” they said. Hokkaido Governor Naomichi Suzuki noted there was a “discrepancy” in the situation regarding businesses in prefectures covered by the emergency and those that were not. Shimane Governor Tatsuya Maruyama said the food service industry in his prefecture is in a “dire situation,” with no economic assistance provided by the central government. Restaurants in prefectures under the emergency umbrella receive relief money from the central government. The governors also called on the government to promptly provide more details about plans to vaccinate the entire population. Specifically, they wanted to know the schedule for shipments to local governments and the amount of doses to be supplied. Fukushima Governor Masao Uchibori made a special request, asking that 10,000 or so workers performing decontamination operations in the prefecture’s Futaba county be inoculated there if they wish. People are basically supposed to get vaccinated in the area where their residence is officially registered. Most of them come from outside the prefecture. They are engaged in cleanup efforts around the stricken Fukushima No. 1 nuclear power plant, which went into a triple meltdown following the 2011 earthquake and tsunami disaster.

0,Experts take issue with early lifting of virus emergency,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"February 27, 2021 at 15:33 JST"," Health experts fear the government acted hastily and rashly in deciding to lift its COVID-19 state of emergency for six prefectures earlier than for four others in the greater Tokyo metropolitan area. The government approved the decision on Feb. 26, the day its panel of experts met prior to a task force gathering that approved the lifting of the state of emergency for Osaka, Kyoto, Hyogo, Aichi, Gifu and Fukuoka prefectures. During the meeting that continued for an hour beyond schedule, a number of experts raised doubts about whether now was the right time to lift the curbs that have seen sharp declines in the daily number of people infected with the novel coronavirus. Others noted the presence of variant strains, calling them a troubling development, and some expressed concern about a possible resurgence in new infections with spring vacation looming for students. “Many of the views expressed were critical,” health minister Norihisa Tamura acknowledged when he spoke with reporters. Governors of the six prefectures had submitted requests to the central government for the state of emergency to be lifted in their jurisdictions ahead of the scheduled March 7 deadline, citing concerns about the impact on their local economies caused by requests to shorten business hours. They also noted sharp declines in the number of new COVID-19 cases and other benchmarks which showed their areas were no longer at the most serious stage 4 in terms of infection trends. Even though they stressed the importance of resuming social and economic activity, they remained keenly aware of the danger of another spike in new infections and the need to maintain steps to prevent a resurgence. For example, heavily populated Osaka Prefecture will reduce the area covered by the request to shorten business hours to just Osaka city rather than the entire prefecture. Moreover, bars and restaurants in the city will be allowed to stay open an hour later until 9 p.m. Osaka Governor Hirofumi Yoshimura noted that it would be essential to remain vigilant given that the period from mid-March until early April is normally a time when graduations and the new school year begins. It is also a time when mass personnel transfers take place at the corporate level. Experts also raised concerns about a rebound in new infections as people start venturing out like they used to. “In light of concerns about a spread of variant strains in the future, another state of emergency may well have to be declared during the series of national holidays in May,” stated Satoshi Hori, a professor of infection control at Tokyo's Juntendo University. He also noted that vaccinations of senior citizens, the most vulnerable and significant portion of the population, will likely not begin on a wide scale until late April. “I believe it will be difficult to realistically achieve a 50-percent inoculation rate by the end of the year,” Hori said, adding that the figure is often used in determining whether herd immunity has been achieved. Given prevailing uncertainties about the vaccine supply, he said it was daft to regard vaccines as a fallback measure in dealing with the COVID-19 crisis. Hori also pointed out that many hospital beds for COVID-19 patients with serious symptoms are now being occupied by senior citizens who tend to remain hospitalized for longer periods. “If there is another spike in community infections, the tight situation facing medical institutions will arrive much more quickly than the third wave of infections now under way,” Hori said. Tetsuya Matsumoto, a professor of infectious diseases at the International University of Health and Welfare in Narita, Chiba Prefecture, raised concerns that lifting the state of emergency in the six prefectures might lead residents to become less cautious in the four prefectures where the state of emergency continues to be in place: Tokyo, Kanagawa, Saitama and Chiba. “I believe it will be difficult to further reduce the number of new cases in the greater Tokyo metropolitan area,” Matsumoto said. He proposed that the state of emergency be extended beyond the March 7 deadline and kept in place until late March. If economic activity is to return to normal over the long haul, Matsumoto said the number of new patients per 100,000 people over the course of a week would have to be around one. As of Feb. 24, the figure was 15 for Tokyo. (Ryo Aibara and Ayako Nakada contributed to this article.)",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14225599

1,Aichi start-up develops ozone gate to remove viruses for hotels,['By HIROTO MOTOI/ Staff Writer'],"February 27, 2021 at 07:00 JST"," TOYOHASHI, Aichi Prefecture--A start-up company here developed equipment that uses ozone gas to blow away and suck in viruses from people and their clothes. The device resembles stand-up scanners used at airports to screen passengers for items or contraband they are prohibited from taking on to aircraft. The company, o3peace, says the product ensures that anybody with the novel coronavirus attached to the body surface and clothes will get a ""clean pass"" before entering a building. It is hoping to sell its gate-shaped ozone gas sprayer to hotels and other commercial facilities. “Ozone is widely used for sterilization and tap water purification in Germany and elsewhere,” noted Yoshiyuki Hagiwara, 42, founder and president of o3peace. “Our goal in future is for large airports to adopt the product.” The ozone gate is 2 meters wide, 2 meters tall and weighs 40 kilograms. Ozone gas generated at high voltage is sprayed from one side of the gate over the person stopping in a designated spot. This, the company says, removes viruses, which are absorbed by a panel on the opposite side. Recovered gas is purified in an overhead duct for circulation. The ozone gate carries a price tag of 1.5 million yen ($14,300), and was made commercially available with a small manufacturer in Toyohashi that has been making ozone-based devices for more than a decade. According to o3peace, it has already received an order from a resort hotel in nearby Tahara and is fielding inquiries from a major hotel operator in Nagoya and an airport operator in a remote Okinawan island. Ozone has been confirmed to be a useful anti-coronavirus measure by researchers at Nara Medical University and Fujita Health University. However, they caution that a higher level of ozone could prove harmful while spraying chemicals into the air might cause health problems. “The ozone concentration is kept at a safe level for the human body, and a feature is added to eliminate the dangerous nitrogen oxide produced along with ozone,” said Hagiwara. As skilled personnel are required to operate and maintain the ozone gate, o3peace is expected to limit the product’s sales to corporate customers only and will not reach out to households for the time being.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14184255
0,State of emergency to end on Feb. 28 for 6 prefectures,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"February 26, 2021 at 18:55 JST"," The government confirmed it will lift the COVID-19 state of emergency early for six prefectures, but the four Tokyo-area prefectures will have to wait until the March 7 deadline. “We will lift the state of emergency for six prefectures as of Feb. 28,” Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga said at a government task force meeting on the evening of Feb. 26. Suga explained that while the situation at medical institutions continued to be tight, it had improved in comparison with the most difficult periods of the pandemic. He added that the numbers of new COVID-19 cases, those with serious symptoms and those hospitalized have decreased since the state of emergency was declared in January. The government’s panel of experts on the health crisis earlier on Feb. 26 gave its consent to the move for an early lifting of the state of emergency. The task force meeting finalized the decision. The state of emergency will end on Feb. 28 for the three Kansai region prefectures of Osaka, Kyoto and Hyogo, the two central Japan prefectures of Aichi and Gifu, and Fukuoka on the main southern island of Kyushu. But infection prevention measures will remain in place even after the state of emergency is lifted. The governors of those six prefectures are expected to ease their requests to bars and restaurants to close operations at 8 p.m. Such business establishments are now receiving 60,000 yen ($566) a day for their cooperation as a subsidy paid for by the central government. Under the new plan, businesses that agree to close at 9 p.m. would receive 40,000 yen while those that close at 10 p.m. would receive 20,000 yen a day. The prefectural governors will determine which businesses in which areas will be covered by the new closing times, but the central government will continue providing the subsidies to the local governments. There will also be a gradual relaxation of restrictions on crowd sizes at events in the prefectures where the state of emergency is lifted. The current upper limit is 5,000 participants. But the new plan would allow for audiences of either 5,000 or half of the capacity of the venue, whichever figure is larger. But the absolute upper limit will be 10,000. The effects of that change will be monitored for about a month. If the rate of new infections appears to be under control, the upper limit of 10,000 will also be eliminated. Sources said the government is not planning to resume the Go To Travel tourism promotion campaign at this stage. It will consider how the campaign should be handled while monitoring infection trends. The experts’ panel also met on Feb. 25 and put together a number of proposals that would help restrain infections once the state of emergency was lifted. With the cherry blossom viewing season just around the corner in some areas, the panel suggested that drinking and partying under the cherry trees would be frowned upon. The panel also proposed concentrated testing for COVID-19 in major entertainment districts.

0,Suga scraps state of emergency briefing as press aide faces the fire,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"February 26, 2021 at 17:38 JST"," Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga abruptly canceled a news conference on Feb. 26, raising suspicions that he is keeping the media from his top public relations aide, embroiled in a scandal. Suga was scheduled to explain the government's decision expected that day to lift the state of emergency for the six prefectures of Osaka, Kyoto, Hyogo, Aichi, Gifu and Fukuoka at the end of February, ahead of the March 7 deadline. Senior staffers at the prime minister's office downplayed the last-minute cancellation, saying Suga is expected to hold a news conference in early March when the government asks for expert opinions on lifting the state of emergency for Tokyo and neighboring prefectures as scheduled. Ending the state of emergency for the six prefectures, after all, isn't really a big deal, one official insisted on Feb. 25. “It’s just that we are going to lift the state of emergency early in several places. It’s not really worth holding a news conference for,” the official said. Instead, the officials are considering making Suga available to take questions from reporters at the entrance hall of the prime minister’s office on the evening of Feb. 26. But many in political circles aren't buying the explanations offered for canceling the news conference. “It’s because of the public relations secretary,” said a central government official who deals with the government’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The official was referring to Makiko Yamada, tied to a wining and dining scandal involving satellite broadcaster Tohokushinsha Film Corp. The company treated the Cabinet public relations secretary to an expensive dinner attended by Suga’s eldest son, a Tohokushinsha employee. Yamada usually leads Suga’s news conferences as the moderator. “Apparently, staffers at the prime minister’s office had divided opinions about Yamada and decided to cancel the news conference,” a government official said. At each milestone of the pandemic, Suga has held a news conference. In January, he did so to declare a state of emergency for Tokyo and three neighboring prefectures, and later to announce the addition of seven prefectures, including Osaka. On Feb. 2, Suga issued the extension of the state of emergency in Tokyo and nine prefectures at a news conference. “I want to send out information thoroughly to people and perform my duty with clear explanation,” he said at the time. The latest decision to cancel the news conference contradicts what Suga promised, critics said. The abrupt decision ""smells fishy,"" said Kiyomi Tsujimoto of the opposition Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan on Feb. 26. If Suga decided to cancel the news conference ""in order to hide Yamada from the (media), that means she has become a stumbling block for people to get information"" about ending the state of emergency, Tsujimoto said. ""Then Yamada is not fit for the task of being the Cabinet public relations secretary."" Chief Cabinet Secretary Katsunobu Kato at a news conference on Feb. 26 denied that Yamada's scandal influenced the decision. ""We will tell people necessary things at the necessary time,"" Kato said. Kato also defended Suga's decision, citing that his predecessor, Shinzo Abe, did not hold a formal news conference either when he lifted the state of emergency in some prefectures in May 2020, instead taking questions from those who stood around him.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14222139
0,Dozens of foreign detainees held in Tokyo contract COVID-19,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"February 26, 2021 at 16:20 JST"," Fifty-five male foreign detainees and six officials in Tokyo have tested positive for COVID-19, the Immigration Services Agency of Japan announced on Feb. 25. The 61 infection cases were confirmed at the Tokyo Regional Immigration Bureau, where the government detains non-Japanese living in Japan without residency status. The Minato Public Health Center in Tokyo’s Minato Ward said that it is aware of the cluster infection. The immigration bureau there is busy responding to the situation, officials said, isolating the infected foreign detainees and moving them to dedicated areas. As new measures to deal with the outbreak, it is limiting the time detainees can leave their rooms and is also prohibiting them from meeting visitors for the time being. “We were told to take social distance from other roommates, but we can’t go outside,” a detained Chinese woman said over the phone. “Potentially getting infected is very scary.” According to the bureau, on Feb. 15, four male foreign detainees and a male official tested positive at the detention center, where about 130 people are staying. After that, officials conducted more polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests on detainees and guards, and more and more tested positive. Officials have yet to determine the routes of infection, but as of now, none of the infected patients is in a critical condition.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14222469

1,Japan to begin COVID-19 shots for 36 million seniors April 12,['By JUNYA SAKAMOTO/ Staff Writer'],"February 25, 2021 at 17:50 JST"," Local municipalities will begin vaccinating Japan's approximately 36 million senior citizens for COVID-19 on April 12, Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga announced on Feb. 24. But as not enough doses for everyone will have arrived in Japan by that date, shots will be administered in stages. Doses for about 50,000 people will be shipped to local municipalities in the week starting April 5. Recipients are supposed to receive two shots to be properly vaccinated. More doses will be delivered to residents of Japan's most populous areas. Tokyo will get doses for about 2,000 people and Kanagawa and Osaka prefectures will each receive the same, said Taro Kono, the state minister in charge of administrative reform, who is also coordinating the vaccination program. Japan's remaining 44 prefectures will then each get doses for about 1,000 people, Kono said, who was speaking at a news conference after Suga announced the vaccine rollout. Kono did not make it clear whether special syringes that can administer six vaccinations from each vial will be ready. He said he will ask prefectural governments to coordinate the allocation of the doses for their local municipalities. In the week starting April 12, doses for about 250,000 people will be shipped across the nation. Tokyo and Kanagawa and Osaka prefectures each will receive doses for 10,000 people while the other 44 prefectures each will receive doses for 5,000 recipients. The government plans to repeat shipments in the same amounts to those areas in the week starting April 19. Kono said he would like to increase the amount of the doses to the level to allow them to be delivered to all the municipalities nationwide in the week starting April 26, putting the vaccination program into full-scale operation. But he did not mention the specific amount of available vaccine doses that would be ready by that date. Kono said he refrained from doing so because he isn't sure how many vaccine doses will arrive in Japan by that time and doses for elderly people will also fall due to the rise in health care professionals subject to the inoculations from about 3.7 million initially estimated to nearly 5 million. Japan's vaccination program has started by targeting health care professionals ahead of elderly people. Kono said that he wanted to start by running the program on a limited scale because he needs to check the operations of the vaccine delivery, the program system and the venues where shots will be administered. He also said that the National Governor’s Association and two other local groups asked him to expand the ranges for the vaccination step by step and proceed with the program carefully. Kono had said earlier that elderly people would begin getting inoculated on April 1 or later. Suga has also said repeatedly in the Diet that they would get shots within April. Though vaccinations will start in April on a trial basis, until now, Kono had spoken only about doses for 550,000 or so people, or less than 2 percent of all the elderly residents who are to be vaccinated. Vaccine doses for 263,250 recipients developed by U.S. pharmaceutical company Pfizer Inc. will arrive from the European Union on March 1, Kono said. The number of the recipients was calculated as six shots can be administered per vial. Japan is currently administering vaccine purchased from Pfizer. The vaccine will be delivered to Japan for the third time.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14219437

0,Kansai leaders request early lifting of state of emergency,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"February 23, 2021 at 19:07 JST"," Three governors of the Kansai region on Feb. 23 urged the central government to end the COVID-19 state of emergency for their prefectures earlier than the scheduled deadline of March 7. The government was already considering an early lifting of the state of emergency at the end of the month for those three prefectures, Osaka, Hyogo and Kyoto, as well as for Aichi, Gifu and Fukuoka prefectures. A final decision will be made as early as Feb. 26, government sources said. If granted, only Tokyo and the neighboring prefectures of Chiba, Kanagawa and Saitama would remain under the state of emergency. The Kansai governors, in an online meeting with Yasutoshi Nishimura, the central government’s point man in dealing with the pandemic, said they have devised measures to keep novel coronavirus infections down if they are removed from the state of emergency. “It is ultimately a decision for the central government,” Nishimura said at the meeting, according to Osaka Governor Hirofumi Yoshimura. “We will make a judgment after considering the infection situation and listening to experts’ opinions.” The governors told Nishimura that restrictions on restaurants and bars will be gradually eased after the state of emergency ends. They also asked the central government to continue to shoulder its share of the 40,000 yen ($380) per day being paid to businesses that comply with requests to shorten their operating hours after the state of emergency is lifted. The central and local governments are currently paying 60,000 yen per day to these businesses. “It is important to seek ways to strike a balance between anti-infection measures and socio-economic activities,” Yoshimura said. Kyoto Governor Takatoshi Nishiwaki said: “Having a rebound in infections is the worst possible thing. We need to ease restrictions gradually.” Meetings of related Cabinet members and experts on the health ministry’s advisory board will be held on Feb. 24. Experts on the central government’s advisory panel are expected to discuss the issue as early as Feb. 26. The government’s headquarters on dealing with the novel coronavirus pandemic will then make a decision on the state of emergency. Experts on the central government’s advisory panel have said the number of new infection cases and the burden on the health care system, among other factors, have improved in the six prefectures. One panel member, however, said it is important to discuss “what measures should be taken after the state of emergency is lifted.” The central government’s expert committee on dealing with the pandemic has started drafting a plan to keep the number of new infection cases low after the end of the state of emergency. The plan is expected to include a gradual easing of restrictions on restaurants and bars, such as shortened operating hours. It will also likely mention that certain targeted areas, rather than an entire prefecture, may be placed under these restrictions. The central government uses a four-stage system for six barometers to determine the novel coronavirus situation in a given area. For a lifting of the state of emergency, a prefecture's infection situation must be improved at least stage 3, one level down from the most serious stage. Some prefectures, including Osaka, have met the condition.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14213795

Devoting more time to the public health crisis, Naruhito also called for continued patience at a news conference held at the Akasaka Imperial Residence prior to his birthday, a national holiday. “I am hoping that a bright future awaits the public as they wholeheartedly overcome the pandemic while sharing their pain together and cooperating with each other,” he said on Feb. 19, referring to the drop in new COVID-19 cases in recent weeks and the coronavirus vaccinations that began last week with health care workers. Naruhito said the emperors have always played roles in providing emotional support to the public during times of natural disasters and pandemics. “It comes from a natural feeling of mine and (Empress) Masako's to give our thoughts, appreciation and encouragement to victims, people with disabilities, senior citizens and people who contributed to society and other people,” he said. Naruhito said that it is an important duty of the imperial family. On Masako, he noted that she has not fully recovered from an adjustment disorder that she has had for many years. The emperor said it is becoming difficult for Masako to improve her condition these days because of restrictions on activities as the pandemic continues. Turning to their only child, Aiko, who turns 20 this year, Naruhito said, “I would like her to carry out her duties with care, while being grateful to and considerate of other people.” Naruhito also said he is aware of various opinions among the public about the planned marriage between Mako, the oldest child of his younger brother, Crown Prince Fumihito, and Crown Princess Kiko, and Kei Komuro, Mako’s college sweetheart. “I am hoping that things will lead to a situation that most people accept and will celebrate,” he said. On the 10th anniversary of the Great East Japan Earthquake, tsunami and the Fukushima nuclear disaster on March 11, the emperor said he will continue to direct his attention to people in the affected area in the Tohoku region. He expressed a desire to visit and meet with victims there if opportunities arise. The visit to the Imperial Palace to celebrate Naruhito’s birthday was canceled due to the pandemic this year, for the second straight year.

The capital set a goal of reducing the number of new COVID-19 cases to 70 percent of the level for the previous week when the second state of emergency was extended to March 7. Although Tokyo did reach that target, the week-on-week percentages have since increased, indicating that the decline in new infections is leveling off. The number of serious cases in Tokyo stood at 77 on Feb. 23, one more from the previous day.

0,Officials: Decline in new COVID-19 cases in Tokyo bottoming out,['By MOMOKO IKEGAMI/ Staff Writer'],"February 22, 2021 at 19:10 JST"," The daily number of new COVID-19 cases in Tokyo has declined, but government officials warn that the trend is bottoming out and that residents, particularly younger people, should not become complacent. “Tokyo is still in the middle of an unpredictable situation, and the number of daily new infections might bounce back,” Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike said at a news conference on Feb. 19. “Please keep taking anti-virus measures.” When the second state of emergency was issued for Tokyo and three surrounding prefectures on Jan. 7, the capital confirmed a record high number of new COVID-19 cases, which has been modified to 2,520. The central and Tokyo metropolitan governments urged the public to avoid nonessential outings and asked restaurants and bars to shorten their operating hours. When the second state of emergency was extended to March 7, Tokyo set a goal of decreasing the daily average of new infections for one week to 70 percent of the levels of the previous week. Koike said the daily number of new cases would drop to 140 or fewer around early March if the 70 percent goal is reached and maintained. The daily average number of new COVID-19 cases in Tokyo did decrease to around 70 percent of the previous weeks’ tallies. But in the last few days, the daily averages have been close to 90 percent of the numbers for the previous week. The daily average for the week to Feb. 18 was 355.1, or 76.3 percent of the previous week’s average. But on Feb. 18, 445 new COVID-19 cases were confirmed in the capital, exceeding 434 marked one week earlier on Feb. 11. It was the first time in about a month for the week-on-week figure to increase. The daily average for the week to Feb. 19 was 84.7 percent of the tally a week earlier, and the corresponding figure was 91.6 percent for the week to Feb. 20. With 272 new infections confirmed in Tokyo on Feb. 21, the daily average for the week up to that day was 89.9 percent of the number for the previous week. On Feb. 22, Tokyo reported 178 newly confirmed infections, breaking below 200 for the first time since 188 cases were reported on Nov. 24 last year. However, the daily average for the week ending Feb. 22 was 329, or 86.9 percent of the previous week. A Tokyo metropolitan government official said the decline in infections is bottoming out partly because of the rise in infected patients in their 20s and 30s. “More young people might have slightly increased their outside activities,” the official said. “Some of them were infected after they dined out on holidays or gathered with friends.” The official urged them to refrain from dining out and to avoid nonessential outings to further decrease the number of new cases. MORE TESTING SOUGHT At the same time, the rate of positive test results, an indicator of how widely the novel coronavirus is spreading among communities, was an average of 4.1 percent for the week until Feb. 19, matching the level in early November last year. It was a significant drop from the peak of 14.5 percent on Jan. 7. However, Masataka Inokuchi, vice chair of the Tokyo Medical Association, pointed out at a meeting on Feb. 18 that the average daily number of tests for the week until Feb. 17 dropped to 6,859 from 7,871 for the previous week. “The virus tests have not been conducted strategically,” he said. “More testing is an effective measure to prevent a resurgence of infection cases.” The central government has set a March 7 deadline for the extended state of emergency for Tokyo and nine prefectures. The medical service capacity of each area will be an important factor on the decision to either lift or further extend the state of emergency. In January, Tokyo had more than 3,000 COVID-19 patients in hospitals, but the number was down to 2,035 patients on Feb. 21, with the hospital bed occupancy rate dropping to less than 50 percent. That rate is lower than the figure that signals the most serious Stage 4 level set by the government’s subcommittee on the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the number of hospitalized patients remains high. DIFFERENCES BETWEEN KANTO, KANSAI Japan confirmed 1,032 new COVID-19 cases and 50 deaths on Feb. 21. According to the health ministry, the number of COVID-19 patients in critical condition decreased by 15 from previous day to 511 on Feb. 20. The three prefectures that confirmed 100 or more new cases on Feb. 21 were all in the capital area: 272 in Tokyo, 163 in Chiba and 100 in Kanagawa. On the other hand, the three prefectures in the Kansai region that are under the state of emergency had lower numbers: 60 in Osaka, 27 in Hyogo and nine in Kyoto.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14211432
1,Vaccine plan to use honor system for pre-existing conditions,['By JUNYA SAKAMOTO/ Staff Writer'],"February 22, 2021 at 15:00 JST"," The government plans to provide COVID-19 vaccinations to people with underlying health issues, the third group on the priority list, based on their self-reported conditions instead of medical certificates. Taro Kono, a state minister who was put in charge of coordinating the novel coronavirus vaccination program, revealed the policy on a news show broadcast by Japan Broadcasting Corp. (NHK) on Feb. 21. Kono also said the government will present an inoculation schedule for the public this week, suggesting a delay until April in the rollout because of limited supplies of the vaccine. Japan began its first inoculations on Feb. 17 among health care workers, the top priority group. For the general public, the government plans to start vaccinating elderly people from April. The next group would be people with pre-existing conditions, such as chronic heart or kidney diseases. However, Kono noted that local governments are not aware of which individuals have such conditions. So the government plans to allow individuals in that category who receive vaccination coupons from local authorities to book inoculations without having to prove their conditions through medical certificates issued by doctors. Kono also said supplies of Pfizer-BioNTech’s Covid-19 vaccine will be “very limited” until April. The number of health care workers in Japan who wanted to get vaccinated was far more than initially expected, and it will take time for Pfizer Inc. to bolster production. “We are hoping to proceed with vaccinations of senior citizens from April, but the rollout will be slower,” Kono said. The government announced a goal of completing inoculations of elderly people in “two months and three weeks.” But Kono indicated that it would be difficult to achieve in some parts of the country. “Major cities are unlikely to finish it as planned,” he said. “But local governments can move on to vaccinating the general public as soon as they finish giving shots to old people.” On Feb. 21, vaccines for about 226,000 people arrived in Japan from Belgium, where Pfizer’s factory is located. That means Japan’s total vaccine supply now is enough to inoculate 420,000 people.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14210995

0,Shortfall in PCR test supplies looms as serious problem in Japan,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"February 21, 2021 at 16:05 JST"," Testing for COVID-19 could soon face serious difficulties in Japan due to a shortage of materials driven by rising global demand. This is because half of the materials used in polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests to detect the presence of a virus are imported, an industry official noted. With stocks running low, this is affecting the ability of testing facilities and university labs. The quantity of imported materials circulating in the Japanese market has significantly decreased since around November, in part because foreign manufacturers prioritize supply to their home countries, the official said. “Many countries are competing for materials to carry out PCR tests,” said a sales representative with a leading domestic wholesaler. “The difficulty in securing adequate supplies could continue for at least the rest of this year.” An employee with a private-sector testing facility in eastern Japan cautioned that “in the worst-case scenario, we will become unable to perform tests if a shortage in supplies continued.” “We have asked several wholesalers to procure whatever is available now, which is forcing us to use alternative items even if their quality is not particularly good,” the employee added. The shortfall is particularly acute with regard to supplies of plastic pipette tips, which store nasal swabs, saliva and other samples; PCR tubes, which contain samples and are placed into a thermal cycler for analysis; and nitrile gloves, which make it easier to do detailed work. As they are all disposable products, test centers and research labs require a huge amount of them. The accuracy of test results could be compromised if the items are not of the highest quality and sterilized, according to experts. Last month, the Japanese arm of Corning Inc., a leading U.S. maker of those products, notified Japanese wholesalers that they faced up to a four-month delay in delivery due to surging global demand. The number of domestic manufacturers of PCR test materials is not sufficient to make up for the sharp shortfall. A leading Japanese manufacturer said it could not catch up with production as orders have jumped five-fold or so since late last year, compared with an ordinary year. The maker was temporarily forced to stop accepting all orders after its sterilization equipment broke down in late January. Investing in additional equipment to bolster output may not be financially viable, given that demand is expected to fall rapidly once the coronavirus pandemic is contained, it added. Getting hold of high-quality PCR tubes has become difficult since late last year, according to a researcher in biology-related science at a university in a local region. “We will not be able to conduct PCR tests after we use up our remaining two boxes of PCR tubes,” the researcher said. “Continuing with our study could become impossible by this spring.” (This article was written by Aya Amano, Ryoma Komiyama and Ichiro Matsuo.)",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14208729

0,Japan has new virus variant that may reduce vaccines’ efficacy,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"February 19, 2021 at 18:58 JST"," Health officials have confirmed Japan now has many cases of a new variant of the novel coronavirus that could make currently available COVID-19 vaccines less effective. The mutated strain of the virus was detected in 91 patients in the Kanto region, with two more confirmed infected with the variant at airport quarantine checks, according to the National Institute of Infectious Diseases (NIID). Tokyo Medical and Dental University on Feb. 18 also reported three cases of the variant in the capital. “The variant could pose a risk to efforts to contain the spread of infections in the mid- to long-term,” an NIID official said. The variant has the E484K mutation and is likely to have been brought in from abroad, officials said. The mutated strain is believed to be capable of “immune escape,” meaning it can evade the body’s immune system. That is raising concerns that some of the immunity acquired through infections with other strains of the virus or vaccinations may not work sufficiently against the variant. Some observers have pointed out that the COVID-19 vaccine developed by British pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca Plc may be less effective against the variant, but the extent to which it could affect the vaccine’s efficacy remains unclear. In studies published in U.S. medical journals, U.S. pharmaceutical company Pfizer Inc. and others concluded that the variant does not have a major impact on the effectiveness of its vaccine. Japan began inoculating its citizens with the vaccine on Feb. 17. Countries across the globe are particularly worried about three kinds of mutated strains of the virus that emerged in Britain, South Africa and Brazil. All the variants have the N501Y mutation, which is feared to be more contagious. The E484K mutation is also confirmed to be in some of the British variants, as well as the variants found in South Africa and Brazil. Japan has also reported every new variant that has been detected among patients in the country. The latest strain recently found in Japan has the E484K mutation, but the N501Y mutation is not confirmed to be in the variant. A panel of experts advising the health ministry said on Feb. 18 that there needs to be continual analysis of the strain. “We need to monitor the variant’s impact as more people receive inoculations,” said Takaji Wakita, who chairs the panel and heads the NIID. Meanwhile, the NIID will launch the country’s first epidemiological study into mutated strains of the virus following the spread of variants across the nation, according to a directive the ministry sent on Feb. 17 to prefectural governments. The NIID will analyze patients’ age and severity of symptoms, along with other factors, after they are confirmed infected with the variants at quarantine checks at airports and other ports of entry. In the study, researchers plan to compare the data with that of other individuals infected with nonmutated stains if their age, gender, recent travel history and other factors line up with those of the patients infected with the variants. The researchers will conduct interviews at medical institutions where the patients were hospitalized to gather necessary information before analyzing the characteristics of the strains, according to the directive. The findings will be used to draw up future anti-virus measures.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14204131

Despite the correction, users still will have to restart the app once a day for it to operate properly. The new version also fixes two other previously unpublicized bugs, one that kept some iPhone users from getting notifications depending on their OS version, and one that initialized the app on some mobile phones, mostly iPhones, after it had been used for a while.

1,Writer prays for health care workers after hospitalization,['By SHIMPEI WAKAMATSU/ Staff Writer'],"February 19, 2021 at 07:00 JST"," Madoka Takadono was puzzled at first when a nurse had offered to pray for her surgery to be successful. But the act of piety made her reflect on the plight of health care workers amid the pandemic and resulted in a viral tweet she hopes will inspire others to think of the medical community at a time of crisis. Takadono, a writer by trade, was hospitalized for an operation a year ago. She was bleeding heavily due to a uterus myoma and had suffered from anemia for about two weeks each month. Her gynecologist put her in contact with a Catholic hospital in a mountainous area in Hyogo Prefecture, where she would stay for three days to undergo endoscopic surgery. She would be anesthetized for the operation, but still, she could not quell her fears. Takadono recalled her family’s faces and welled up. “If by any chance something happens to me, they would feel sad,” she thought. Trying to dispel her anxiety and take her mind off the procedure, Takadono, who also creates stories for manga titles, downloaded the entire series of “Jojo's Bizarre Adventure,” a popular manga. Uterus myoma is a sort of benign tumor derived from muscular tissue, and results in heavier menstruation. It is characterized by menstrual pain and anemia, but some patients do not realize they have the condition until they are diagnosed. Because it can put pressure on other internal organs, it can also cause frequent urination, constipation, infertility, miscarriage and prematurity. Just before being transferred to the surgery room, a nurse asked Takadono whether she would mind if she prayed for her. Perplexed, Takadono said “go ahead.” The nurse, who looked about the same age or a bit younger than Takadono, held her hands in front of her and uttered words of prayer. “May she go through the surgery safely and regain health to return to her family,” the nurse murmured. Takadono did not know what to do, so she just watched the nurse pray. Takadono wondered whether she prays for all the patients before their operations and if all the staffers working there are Christians. Afterward, Takadono told her that she “was a little excited because I had never seen someone pray for me.” The nurse explained that her employer does not force her to pray; she simply wished to do so. Hospital workers there rely on their faith to get through every day because, despite their best efforts, some things are simply out of their control. After arriving in the surgery room, Takadono saw a doctor and another nurse pray for her as well. While the anesthesia was being administered, Takadono thought she wants to “return safely so people here will go home feeling good.” She then lost consciousness. She recently shared her story and feelings on Twitter late at night, in a show of support for health care providers amid the pandemic, and her tweet quickly gained traction. Takadono had worked at a medical facility before becoming a writer, and she knows all too well that nurses do not enjoy high wages. They are constantly busy, ensuring that patients going through hard times can spend their days in peace and comfort. Takadono was concerned that praying for patients in addition to all that work might exhaust the overworked medical staff. She occasionally thinks back to the nurse’s prayer on her operation day, even after her surgery was completed and she was discharged from the hospital. Toward the end of 2020, Takadono watched a succession of news reports on the burden being placed on medical centers due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Health care workers would accept patients with a little-known disease and keep working despite their fears of unfamiliar tasks and the deadly virus. It is now my turn, Takadono thought, inspired by their kindness, to pray for nurses and doctors in return. Takadono sent emails to local city assembly members and prefectural politicians with the hope of making them better understand the difficult circumstances medical facilities are facing every day. Though politicians may be too busy to reply, she believes their mission is to become aware of citizens’ prayers earlier than anyone else. Many responses sympathetic to her Twitter post gave Takadono confidence in the power of prayer. The writer and dramatist has created and published works that shed light on people across various occupations and social strata who find themselves in vulnerable positions. She believes it is the writer’s job to get the public interested in those kinds of topics through their stories so people can better understand the world and people around them. Her work “Tokkan” (Special national tax collector), for example, centers on a tax collector, and has been adapted into a TV drama. “Joryu Kaikyu” (Upper class) revolves around a department store sales official targeting wealthier individuals, while “Grand Chateau” tells a story about the bond between two women in a cabaret. No matter what kind of job they take, people who have long devoted themselves to their workplaces are precious and irreplaceable, Takadono said. She hopes it will become more common for people to seek out the understanding of others through learning about the experiences of workers in different occupations, which would, in turn, help people like the nurse who prayed for her that day.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14165840

1,Inexpensive and easy to use ventilator for COVID-19 cases developed,['By ARI HIRAYAMA/ Staff Writer'],"February 18, 2021 at 08:00 JST"," KAWAGUCHI, Saitama Prefecture--A company here is fielding inquiries from all over the world after developing a ventilator that it says anybody can operate and which costs one-10th the price of conventional devices. “Only a limited number of countries and hospitals are in a position to purchase expensive ventilators,” said Tran Ngoc Phuc, the Vietnamese founder of medical equipment maker Metran Co. “Producing cheaper respirators in bulk will help to save countless lives.” Phuc, 73, worked with an auto parts manufacturer to develop the device to reduce the burden on doctors grappling with the COVID-19 crisis. He was particularly concerned about relieving the hardships that doctors in developing countries face. Metran's main business is manufacturing respirators to help keep premature babies alive. Its products are widely used in hospitals nationwide. Emperor Emeritus Akihito visited the company's factory in 2012 before he abdicated. Phuc noted that doctors battling the novel coronavirus pandemic are being stretched to the limit as only respiratory specialists are allowed to operate breathing equipment deemed so vital to cope with the surge in cases. The machine's operation was simplified so users, at the touch of a button, can select operation modes, depending on whether patients are breathing spontaneously. A safe pressure system sends oxygen at a constant pressure. Conventional ventilators determine the amount of oxygen to be pumped based on a patient’s body size and health condition. The slimmed down device costs around 600,000 yen ($5,698), one-10th the price of conventional models. Metran teamed with Saitama-based Marelli Corp., which manufactures a wide range of automotive products such as electric powertrain and lighting, to churn out 2,000 units a month. A clinical trial covering 60 cases in Vietnam showed that Phuc's ventilator works as well as its pricey counterparts, the company said. The first five units that rolled out of the factory were donated to Bolivia. Metran said it has received a succession of orders from Kyrgyzstan, Indonesia and India, among other nations. The device has yet to gain approval for use in Japan, but more than one medical center has already contacted Metran about purchasing machines at a later date, according to Metran representatives. Phuc arrived in Japan as a student in 1968 while the Vietnam War was raging. Deciding it was impossible to return to his homeland, he opted to live permanently in Japan and adopt Japanese citizenship. As chairman of the Vietnamese Association in Japan, Phuc is also involved in ways to provide assistance for Vietnamese students and interns in Japan. “I am indebted to both Vietnam and Japan,” said Phuc, adding that he will continue trying to lend a helping hand to both countries.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14165843

0,Health ministry had 2-month lag on ferreting out COCOA app bugs,['By RYOMA KOMIYAMA/ Staff Writer'],"February 15, 2021 at 19:00 JST"," It took the health ministry two months to uncover the problems plaguing its COVID-19 contact-tracing smartphone app, which made it useless to Android users, after the bugs and their causes were first publicly pointed out in November. The free contact-tracing app, called COCOA, was introduced to alert people if they came into close contact with someone who had tested positive for COVID-19. It is designed to notify users if they have been within a radius of 1 meter for longer than 15 minutes of other app users infected with the novel coronavirus. The app had been downloaded about 25 million times, and Android users account for about 7.7 million of the downloads. But Android users were not getting notifications, even if they came into contact with other users who had tested positive, since the end of last September. Those kinds of bugs were not reported among iPhone users. According to the announcement, the health ministry learned of the bugs on Jan. 25 from a company it had outsourced to develop the app. But the issue was discovered much earlier than that. On Nov. 25, a poster named “zaruudon” publicly identified the program bugs by looking at the developers’ code for the app, which was posted on the website GitHub. “I believe that contact with infected users will not be detected by the current Android version,” the user said in a post and pointed to the source of the problem. The COCOA app was initially being developed by Microsoft Japan Co. volunteers, free of charge. They had started work on the project around March last year. But at the beginning of May, Alphabet Inc.’s Google and Apple Inc. suggested to countries around the world that apps should be controlled by public health authorities and each country should adopt only one app. After that, the health ministry assumed the development responsibilities. On May 25, Shinzo Abe, the prime minister at the time, announced at a news conference that the app would be “available around the middle of June.” Based on that timeline, the health ministry needed to complete development just a month and half after it took over the project. The ministry did not have enough time to publicly solicit developers, according to sources. The ministry chose Persol Process and Technology Co., which was also the company it had outsourced development of a software management system for infected patients, called HER-SYS. The company then subcontracted maintenance work on the app to the information technology company MTI Ltd. According to the health ministry, the app bugs are attributable to a version upgrade on Sept. 28. When apps are revised, it is necessary to check if they work properly in advance. But instead of reviewing how it worked across two different smartphones, one for an infected user and another for a user who came into close contact with them, only the latter was checked. The Tuberculosis and Infectious Diseases Control Division admitted that the buck stops with the health ministry, but it noted it was not the only actor that bears responsibility. “The outsourcing company has a responsibility to check comments like the one posted on the GitHub website,” an official said. The COCOA app did not have a function to collect bug information output from mobile phones, which makes it more difficult to determine the causes of problems. It lacked that functionality because the ministry was concerned about user privacy, sources said. But aside from that issue, other kinds of bugs emerged once the app became publicly available. The government’s expert panel that deals with the app gave the nod in September that information on the app’s glitches could be collected. The collection started on Dec. 3. The health ministry finally came to grasp the bugs behind the problem in January--four months after they surfaced in September. “It is difficult for outsourcing companies to respond to everything within their contract when deluged by comments,” said Masanori Kusunoki, an aide to the government’s chief information officer and a member of the expert panel on the COCOA app. “The ministry should reflect on the fact that it did not decide how it would respond to serious comments in advance.”",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14191936

1,Could lying face down prevent COVID symptoms from worsening?,['By CHIAKI OGIHARA/ Staff Writer'],"February 15, 2021 at 07:00 JST"," Nurse Hideaki Dairi had an eye-opening experience during a night shift in April last year that changed how he and other health care workers treat COVID-19 patients with moderate symptoms. A colleague at the Metropolitan Komagome Hospital in Tokyo’s Bunkyo Ward came rushing up to Dairi, 58, alarmed that a patient’s blood oxygen level was low and nothing was bringing it back up. The oxygen level refers to the percentage of hemoglobin carrying oxygen in the blood, and it should be close to 100 percent for a healthy individual. The patient--an elderly woman hospitalized with COVID-19--had oxygen level reading below 90 percent at the time. She was apparently suffering from respiratory failure, and her numbers showed few signs of improvement, even when the concentration of oxygen inhaled reached the maximum. “Would you try lying face down?” Dairi proposed. She agreed. Her oxygen level improved dramatically within about three minutes. “It was like magic,” Dairi said. Since that encounter, a group of nurses working at a special coronavirus ward there has taken up the question of whether lying prone could effectively prevent COVID-19 patients with moderate symptoms from developing severe conditions. And it is drawing the attention of medical workers across Japan. There is still a lot to learn about the potentially promising practice and COVID-19, and there are still practical problems to sort out. But the simple technique is now being touted as a therapeutic breakthrough that could help lessen the load on hospital beds allocated for severe COVID-19 cases, which are falling into tighter supply as the health crisis worsens. What is called “prone position therapy” (PPT), or the therapeutical practice of having a patient lie face down, has been endorsed and promoted by the likes of Shigeaki Hinohara (1911-2017), an influential doctor and essayist. The health ministry’s treatment guidelines for COVID-19 patients note that PPT is effective for cases that involve severe pneumonia. But the potential effectiveness of PPT for moderate COVID-19 cases, which require oxygen administration, if not the use of an artificial respirator, has not been broadly recognized. SIMPLE, BUT EFFECTIVE Following Dairi’s night-shift discovery, staff at the hospital ward began coordinating PPT on patients with moderate cases under the direction of attending physicians. Between April and October last year, Dairi and his colleagues in the special COVID-19 ward performed PPT on 23 patients with moderate symptoms for seven hours a day. As a result, the blood oxygen saturation, an indicator for the level of oxygen intake into the blood, improved in all the cases. Respiratory rates also dropped in 16 of the 18 cases for which records were taken. Two of the 23 patients managed to avoid being put on an artificial respirator, Dairi said. He explained that the prone position works so well because it makes the most of the patient’s lung functions. COVID-19 pneumonia typically damages the dorsal lung regions, in which case a patient lying face up finds it difficult to take in sufficient oxygen. Lying face down, by comparison, allows more blood to flow into the healthier ventral lung regions, resulting in improved oxygen intake, Dairi said. Dairi presented the PPT findings at the 42nd annual meeting of the Japanese Society of Respiratory Care Medicine in December at a session of non-invited talks on COVID-19. At the session, he received the best talk prize because, among other things, the practice could prove effective at preventing the onset of severe symptoms. Cases have surged since the academic talk, but at the same time its effectiveness as a therapy is becoming ever clearer, Dairi said. STILL EARLY DAYS Performing PPT on patients with severe symptoms who find it difficult to move their bodies on their own requires the involvement of skilled workers who know how to change their body positions so pressure on their eyes do not cause a loss of eyesight and catheters and other tubes do not slip out. There are, however, fewer concerns for patients with moderate symptoms who can turn over on their own in bed, Dairi said. That said, putting the therapy into practice is not without its challenges. For example, a protracted application of PPT therapy means that patients spend longer hours in bed, which could cause their legs to weaken. It is difficult for obese patients to lie face down. And doctors have yet to establish the optimal length of time to lie prone. “We will see clues to solving those problems when we have accumulated more knowledge,” Dairi said. In Tokyo, 133 of the total 315 hospital beds available for severe COVID-19 cases were occupied as of Feb. 1. The number of available depressurized rooms, used to deal with patients with severe symptoms, is limited. Also, skilled workers must be present to deal with patients who require intubation with an artificial respirator. “A more widespread use of PPT for moderate COVID-19 cases could help avert the need for artificial ventilators in some of those cases and thereby lessen the load of hospital beds for severe cases,” Dairi said. Midori Kawashima, a professor emerita with the Japanese Red Cross College of Nursing, also expressed optimism about a broader use of PPT on COVID-19 patients with moderate symptoms. “That could serve as a means for preventing a collapse of the public health care system, at a time when people agree on a need to do so but they have no concrete measures in sight for doing so,” Kawashima said. “I know it is never easy to work on something new when patients are arriving in large numbers, but if patients get better, that will provide a boost to nurses on the front lines who have long been working in distress,” she added. “I hope more hospitals will learn about this new practice.”",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14159426

0,New uproar at medical university over decision to withhold pay,['By RYO MIYAZAKI/ Staff Writer'],"February 14, 2021 at 18:00 JST"," Doctors, nurses and administrative staff attached to Tokyo Women’s Medical University are up in arms again, this time over a new policy to withhold pay in cases where individuals contract COVID-19 and take leave after flouting established antivirus procedures. The latest confrontation follows an uproar last summer in which hundreds of nurses threatened to quit after the university announced it would not pay summer bonuses due to falling revenues because of the coronavirus pandemic. The union is demanding that the new policy be retracted immediately on grounds it is tantamount to punishing people who become infected with the novel coronavirus. According to the labor union, the university notified staff on Jan. 28 to strictly follow anti-coronavirus measures, such as wearing goggles and other protective gear while at work. It also called on staff to take meals alone. The following day, an additional notification stated that paid leave would not be paid if absences from work due to COVID-19 or self-isolation at home after running fevers or displaying other symptoms were found to have resulted from not complying with the university’s request to take thorough precautions against the virus or from “clearly inappropriate behavior.” In protest, the union pointed out in a Feb. 10 statement that the new policy does not clearly explain the basis upon which university officials determine whether staff members ignored the management’s request or had behaved recklessly. “There are fears that the university will decide that people other than those who got the virus while working at the hospital did act inappropriately if they got sick,” said one employee. Another questioned the university's abrupt decision to change the existing rule that stated special paid leave would apply to anybody who contracts COVID-19 or stays home due to fever. In an interview with The Asahi Shimbun, university officials said they will not base their decision to withhold pay based solely on an individual having contracted COVID-19. “We set a policy targeting only employees who failed to comply with our request to thoroughly abide by our measures against the virus and ended up heightening the risk of infections,” one official said. After the uproar over unpaid summer bonuses, the university reversed its position and paid a basic salary of one month in lieu, half the amount of the previous summer.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14189558

1,Suga appoints minister of loneliness as suicides surge,['By TAKAHIRO OKUBO/ Staff Writer'],"February 13, 2021 at 15:55 JST"," A rise in suicides stemming in large part from feelings of isolation due to the COVID-19 pandemic prompted Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga to follow the example of Britain and establish a Cabinet portfolio to battle loneliness. On Feb. 12, Suga named Tetsushi Sakamoto as state minister in charge of coordinating measures to help those feeling isolated as a result of the novel coronavirus crisis. Sakamoto is already the Cabinet minister in charge of regional revitalization. When she led Britain in 2018, Theresa May established the world’s first minister to combat loneliness, which she described as the most serious public health issue confronting British society. Japan in the past has appointed ministers to handle issues associated with loneliness, such as “hikikomori” individuals who do not leave their homes, often for years, and solitary deaths. When Suga met with Sakamoto on Feb. 12, he told him to promote comprehensive measures cutting across ministry jurisdictions. Suga pointed to an increase in suicides among women due to the COVID-19 crisis and other issues of loneliness stemming from requests from the government to refrain from unnecessary outings. At a subsequent news conference, Sakamoto commented that “societal ties in general have become weaker.” He pointed to measures already in place to reduce the suicide rate, citing programs to look after senior citizens who live alone and child poverty. But he said he would work so that those in need of government help would receive appropriate help. A forum will be held later in February bringing together those in nonprofit organizations who have worked on issues related to loneliness to iron out areas that need further work. A group of ruling Liberal Democratic Party lawmakers formed a study group in January to look into the matter. Lower House member Takako Suzuki, one of the group organizers, said during the Feb. 4 Lower House Budget Committee session: “We have to find ways to reduce the number of people suffering from loneliness they never wanted. There is a need for a grass roots approach.” Suga may have created the position out of embarrassment he felt at a Jan. 28 Lower House Budget Committee when an opposition lawmaker asked him which minister was in charge of loneliness. Suga said Norihisa Tamura, the welfare minister, was in charge, but Tamura himself looked puzzled and responded that he did not recall being given the assignment.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14187206
1,First COVID-19 vaccinations look set to begin from Feb. 17,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"February 13, 2021 at 15:25 JST"," Japan is gearing up to start vaccinating its population against the novel coronavirus as early as Feb. 17 after the first shipment of doses arrived from Brussels. The vaccine will be given to people aged 16 and older. A second dose will be given three weeks after the first. Senior citizens could begin receiving the vaccine from April 1. Next on the priority list are individuals with a pre-existing health condition and workers at elderly care facilities. The health ministry is set to formally approve the first vaccine as early as Feb. 14. An experts’ panel in the ministry gave the green light Feb. 12 for the production and sale of a vaccine jointly developed by U.S. pharmaceutical company Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech, a German biocommerce company. Once ministry approval is obtained, vaccinations on health care professionals look set to begin next week. The health ministry signed a contract with Pfizer for about 144 million doses to be provided this year, enough to inoculate around 72 million people. The first shipment of the vaccine arrived on the morning of Feb. 12 at Narita Airport outside Tokyo from Brussels. Pfizer submitted an application in December for a special approval procedure based on the results of clinical testing overseas on about 40,000 people. The company submitted additional clinical testing data Jan. 29 that was obtained from 160 Japanese. The Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency has been assessing the data provided by Pfizer. In overseas testing, the infection rate was reduced by 95 percent and a similar level of immunity was found in the test conducted in Japan. There were also no serious side effects, although instances of pain, headache and joint ache matched those in the overseas tests. Expectant women can receive the vaccine if their doctor feels the benefits outweigh the risks. But those who have displayed a serious allergic reaction to the components of the vaccine will be asked to refrain from being vaccinated. The central government will pay for the vaccines and people will not be forced into vaccinations. The first vaccinations will be on 10,000 to 20,000 health care professionals working at about 100 medical institutions around Japan, including hospitals under the National Hospital Organization. The first group will be monitored for side effects on their health. All other health care professionals will receive the vaccine from March if no problems arise. The vaccine has to be stored at minus 75 degrees or so because RNA used to produce it is very fragile. The government has also signed formal contracts with AstraZeneca, a British pharmaceutical company, for 120 million doses and the U.S. biocompany Moderna Inc. for 50 million doses.

A government health panel is due to deliberate on the vaccine later on Friday. Kyodo News reported that approval would come on Sunday. Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga has said vaccinations would begin from the middle of next week, starting with some 10,000 health workers. The government hopes to secure enough supplies for the whole populace by mid-year. About 400,000 doses arrived at Narita International Airport, near Tokyo, on Friday morning aboard a flight from Brussels, Kyodo reported. There had been concern that the European Union could block exports of the shots, prompting Japan’s vaccine chief to warn against growing nationalism over supplies. The European Commission said on Thursday it has so far approved all requests for the export of COVID-19 vaccines, including to Japan, after setting up a mechanism to monitor vaccine flows on Jan. 30. A Japanese health ministry official declined to comment on reports of the vaccine’s arrival, citing security reasons. Japan has arranged to buy 144 million doses of the vaccine made by the U.S. drugmaker and German partner BioNTech, enough to inoculate 72 million people. It also has deals for vaccines developed by AstraZeneca Plc, Moderna Inc. and Novavax Inc. So far only Pfizer and AstraZeneca have submitted applications for approval. Most of Japan is still under a state of emergency after its third and most deadly wave of the virus hit late last year. Cases and fatalities have trended lower in the past couple of weeks and Tokyo logged just over 300 cases on Friday. Japan has so far recorded about 410,000 coronavirus cases and 6,772 deaths.

1,Sources: No early lifting of COVID-19 state of emergency,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"February 11, 2021 at 14:18 JST"," Japan will not lift the state of emergency for the novel coronavirus pandemic this week because the medical care situation remains tight in many prefectures, several government and ruling coalition sources said. Government officials had indicated that the state of emergency could be lifted before the March 7 deadline if new infection numbers fell and the medical care situation improved. Although the number of new infections has decreased, hospitals are still struggling to care for COVID-19 patients and secure beds for them. “The hospital bed situation remains very tight, and no prefectural governor has strongly called for a lifting of the state of emergency,” a high-ranking official in the prime minister’s office said. The state of emergency for 11 prefectures was initially scheduled to end on Feb. 7, but it was extended for another month for 10 of those prefectures. The revised special measures law to deal with the novel coronavirus pandemic is set to go into effect on Feb. 13, and government officials initially considered lifting the state of emergency for some prefectures around that date. The revised law contains provisions for concentrated measures to be taken even after the state of emergency has been lifted in a prefecture, such as requesting bars and restaurants to reduce their business hours. Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga met with the relevant Cabinet ministers and ruling coalition lawmakers on Feb. 10 to discuss what course to take. “The hospital bed situation is still very serious in many prefectures,” Suga said. “There should be a thorough implementing of the measures now in place concerning eateries to further reduce new infections and lead to a reduction in the number of hospitalized patients and those with serious symptoms.” The government plans to hold a meeting of its advisory panel and task force dealing with the pandemic on Feb. 12 to discuss the basic government direction in line with the changes in the revised special measures law. One possible agenda item for that meeting was whether to lift the state of emergency for Aichi and Gifu prefectures in central Japan and have those two prefectures implement the concentrated measures to hold down new infections. But the hospital bed usage ratio in Aichi Prefecture as of Feb. 9 was 51 percent, slightly above the 50-percent benchmark the government is using to classify a region as being in the most serious stage 4 in terms of the spreading of infections. Because Gifu borders Aichi and the two prefectures are closely linked in terms of economic and other activities, government officials were hesitant about lifting the state of emergency for just one of the two prefectures. At a Feb. 9 news conference, Shigeru Omi, chairman of the government panel of experts, indicated he was placing greater emphasis on the burden on the medical care structure rather than the number of new COVID-19 cases in deciding whether to lift the state of emergency. Other high-ranking government officials also raised concerns about a possible rebound in new infections if the state of emergency is lifted before the deadline.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14181601

1,Weaker virus strain might be treatable with drug for cats,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"February 10, 2021 at 18:24 JST"," A research team in Japan identified a variant strain of the novel coronavirus that it says might be treatable with a drug developed to treat cats with the disease due to its weakness. The researchers from Tokyo’s Keio University and Osaka University confirmed the strain leads to comparatively minor symptoms in humans. An antivirus drug known as GC376 has been developed abroad that has been used to treat feline infectious peritonitis, a fatal disease caused by a novel coronavirus in cats. It has also been found to interfere with the same enzyme found in the variant strain of the virus found in humans, opening the possibility that it could be used to treat them. But despite the team's findings, Makoto Suematsu, the Keio professor who heads it, said, “There is a need to be cautious because a different variant strain is now spreading that can replicate much more quickly than the weaker variant.” The DNA of the strain consists of about 30,000 pairs made up from four bases. One base replaces another in a pair at the rate of once every 15 days, creating new variant strains. One variant strain confirmed in Britain has been found to be much more contagious than previous ones. The team analyzed samples taken from COVID-19 patients between March and August 2020 who were treated at Keio University Hospital. One major finding was that 48 patients infected with a variant strain that has mutations in the gene that creates the 3CLPro enzyme were less likely to suffer serious symptoms in comparison to 37 patients who did not have the variant strain. Experiments led to the finding that the new strain lowered the activity of the enzyme by about half and that, in turn, interfered with the multiplication of the virus. That weaker variant strain was found in a majority of the COVID-19 patients during the second wave last summer, but the number of such patients has dropped in recent months.

1,Virus-response powers widened for areas not under emergency,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"February 10, 2021 at 15:48 JST"," Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga’s Cabinet has approved new anti-coronavirus measures that prefectural governors can employ when a state of emergency is not in place, boosting their ability to control the spread of infections. The Cabinet order, approved on Feb. 9, gives prefectural governors the authority to request or order businesses to change business hours and take infection-prevention measures, such as placing disinfectant containers at entrances or prohibiting people not wearing face masks from entering. All the measures carry fines for individuals and businesses that refuse to comply. It follows the revision earlier this month of a special measures law that deals with the health scare. Those changes introduced a set of concentrated measures that can be put in place before a state of emergency is declared. In that instance, the aim would be to curb infections early enough so that a state of emergency may not be needed. The measures can also be used after a state of emergency has been lifted to prevent the virus’ spread from rebounding. The revised special measures law takes effect on Feb. 13, and the Cabinet order lays out the necessary conditions to implement the concentrated measures. “We will use the provisions in a flexible manner to restrain a further spread of infections by all means,” said Yasutoshi Nishimura, the state minister in charge of economic revitalization, who also heads the central government’s handling of the novel coronavirus pandemic. He was speaking at a Feb. 9 meeting of a government panel of experts dealing with the COVID-19 health scare that went over the details of the Cabinet order. Under the new rules, prefectural governors can specify the types of eateries or bars covered by their requests and orders. The decision on which types of businesses to target would be based on the number of infections or infection clusters linked to them. Governors will be able to encourage staff at eateries to test for COVID-19, as well as limit the number of entrants to a business or event. Governments can also bring about extra measures if the health minister decides such steps would help curb the spread of infections. Individuals and businesses that refuse to comply with any of the measures without a good reason will face a maximum fine of 200,000 yen ($1,900). Governments can bring about the new, concentrated measures when concerns emerge in a prefecture over a rapid rise in infections, and when the local medical care structure comes under strain based on the number of new COVID-19 cases and patients with untraceable infection routes. The expert panel meeting also addressed what measures to implement to allow for lifting the state of emergency now in place in 10 prefectures until March 7, and for preventing a second surge in infections as well. Shigeru Omi, who heads the panel, said one big lesson learned over the past year is that traditional seasonal activities have a major influence on the spread of infections. He urged restraint regarding farewell parties and group trips toward March, which marks the end of the fiscal year and the end of the school year as well. Companies normally assign major personnel transfers for the start of the new fiscal year, often accompanied by parties to bid farewell to those leaving and for welcoming new colleagues into the workplace. Two economists on the panel, Fumio Otake, a professor at Osaka University, and Keiichiro Kobayashi, a research director at the Tokyo Foundation for Policy Research, submitted projections on how the start of vaccinations for COVID-19 will affect public health and the economy. The two scholars estimate that if vaccinations of senior citizens begin in the first week of April and some 4 million people get vaccinated every week until the end of June, the number of fatalities from COVID-19 would decrease by about 6,000 and the negative economic effects could also be restrained.

The mass testing of the public will begin once the extended state of emergency issued to Tokyo and nine prefectures is lifted, which is scheduled for March 7. The government hopes the random testing can provide valuable information to predict an imminent surge of novel coronavirus infections. Under the plan, the government will use facilities located in the busiest neighborhood and welcome people to drop in to take a test. In addition to examining the test results, officials will use artificial intelligence software to analyze social media so they can detect early indicators that suggest the virus will spread further. Officials said they will look for various patterns of chatter, like whether the number of people in certain areas posting about getting a fever increases. They will also monitor for comments such as, “Let’s have a drinking party!” that may suggest if personal behavior or events will lead to an increase in transmission. “We want to lay out a framework to start the monitoring tests in busy areas in Tokyo and Osaka, among others, because the infections spread from major urban locations to the countryside,” Yasutoshi Nishimura, the state minister in charge of the government’s response to the pandemic, said at a news conference after a Cabinet meeting on Feb. 9.

0,Syringe mix-up to hurt efficiency in COVID-19 vaccine program,['By KOHEI TOMIDA/ Staff Writer'],"February 10, 2021 at 14:24 JST"," The health ministry has secured the wrong syringes for efficient use of Pfizer Inc.’s COVID-19 vaccine, a discovery that could force a review of the inoculation program. A special syringe is needed to extract six doses from one vial of the vaccine. But ministry officials checked the domestic stock of syringes and found that most of them can only extract five doses per vial, health minister Norihisa Tamura said at a Lower House Budget Committee meeting on Feb. 9. These syringes would still contain some of vaccine in the needle after injection. They are to be disposed of after each use. The ministry has started looking for the special syringes, officials said. Japan has signed a contract with Pfizer, a U.S. pharmaceutical giant, to receive 144 million doses of its COVID-19 vaccine, enough to inoculate 72 million people. “Our deal with Pfizer is that they provide us with 144 million doses,” a ministry official said. “We will discuss the matter with Pfizer. It is too early to tell if the total number of doses will be reduced.” However, a senior ministry official hinted at the possibility that fewer people will be inoculated with Pfizer’s supply. “We have no option but to go ahead with the premise that we can inject only five people per vial,” the official said. A health ministry meeting on Feb. 12 will discuss approval of Pfizer’s vaccine. If approved, inoculation of health care workers will start as early as next week. The ministry will revise guidelines of the vaccination process for local governments by the end of this week. According to the ministry, each vial contains the vaccine stock solution. Health care workers dilute the vaccine stock solution in saline, then insert a syringe into the vial to extract a certain amount for inoculation. Pfizer has told the ministry that six doses can be taken from one vial.

1,Osaka meets own criteria allowing it to request state of emergency exit,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"February 9, 2021 at 19:03 JST"," OSAKA-- Osaka on Feb. 8 met the drop in daily new COVID-19 cases benchmark it set of an average of 300 or fewer for the previous seven days, allowing it to ask the central government to lift the prefecture's state of emergency. Osaka Prefecture on Feb. 1 decided on criteria that would permit it to request the lifting of the state of emergency. For seven days in a row, its average number of new daily cases for the past week has to be 300 or under or the occupancy rate for beds for patients with serious symptoms has to be below 60 percent. The average number of new cases for the last seven days was 292 on Feb. 2, 193 on Feb. 7 and 185 on Feb. 8, meeting the criteria. The occupancy rate for beds for patients with severe symptoms has also been declining steadily, but it was 63.1 percent as of Feb. 7. Osaka will decide whether it will actually make the request after discussing the matter with Kyoto and Hyogo prefectures, which were also placed under the state of emergency at the same time, and listening to the opinions of experts. “The number of new patients has been dropping steadily,” Osaka Governor Hirofumi Yoshimura told reporters on Feb. 8. “I would like to make a decision after I listen to what experts will say tomorrow,"" referring to a meeting of Osaka's COVID-19 task force on Feb. 9. “If possible, I want to make the request along with Kyoto and Hyogo,” he said. “I do not assume that Osaka will do it alone.” Kyoto and Hyogo prefectures have not met their own required benchmarks for requesting the state of emergency be lifted. Kyoto also set two conditions. Its average number of new daily cases for the previous seven days has to be under 50; and the occupancy rate for beds for patients with serious symptoms must be below 50 percent. If it meets both conditions for seven consecutive days, Kyoto can request the emergency be lifted. But Kyoto just met both criteria for the first time on Feb. 6. Hyogo set conditions on new cases and bed spaces as well. Its number of new cases for the previous seven days has to be 10 or less per 100,000 people; and the occupancy rate for beds for patients with serious symptoms must be under 50 percent. Hyogo must meet both conditions for seven days in a row. But Hyogo reported about 11.67 new cases per 100,000 people and a 50 percent bed occupancy rate as of Feb. 8, not meeting the criteria. Hyogo also has another condition stipulating that the problems of patients recuperating at home because they cannot be hospitalized or stay at accommodation facilities due to lack of vacancies should be reduced to a certain level. Hyogo had 345 patients at home on a waiting list for hospitals or accommodation facilities as of Feb. 7. Hyogo Governor Toshizo Ido was reluctant to ask the central government to lift the state of emergency for the prefecture. “Now is not a good time to decide it based on the current situation,” he said at a Feb. 8 news conference. “Hyogo, Osaka and Kyoto are included in the same economic and social zone, so we should basically fall into line.” (This article was written by Chinami Tajika and Ryo Takeda.)",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14175986

The results of antibody testing for COVID-19 as of December showed all areas covered by the study with ratios under 1 percent. Achieving herd immunity against an illness requires that between 60 to 70 percent of the population develop some form of immunity, either through contracting the disease or being vaccinated. But the results released Feb. 5 by the health ministry for a second antibody study showed the ratios to be 0.91 percent in Tokyo, 0.58 percent in Osaka, 0.54 percent in Aichi, 0.19 percent in Fukuoka and 0.14 percent in Miyagi. With such low figures, the ministry called on the public to continue to observe infection-prevention measures. The study involved testing 15,043 residents aged 20 or older in the five prefectures for COVID-19 antibodies. There was a slight uptick in the antibody ratios in comparison to the first study conducted last June. At that time, the ratios were 0.1 percent in Tokyo, 0.17 percent in Osaka and 0.03 percent in Miyagi. There are many unknowns about the novel coronavirus, including how long the antibody remains in the body of an infected person. “The latest results show that the ratio of people with immunity is still very low,” noted Junichiro Nishi, a professor of infectious diseases at Kagoshima University on the main southern island of Kyushu. “If herd immunity is to be achieved, large numbers of people will need to be vaccinated.” (This article was written by Kohei Tomida and Kenta Noguchi.)",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14168304

1,"As deaths soar, Tokyo sets new target to reduce COVID-19 cases",['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"February 5, 2021 at 19:08 JST"," The Tokyo metropolitan government aims to cut the daily average number of new COVID-19 cases by 30 percent or more every week until early March. The new goal of suppressing the average number of new daily cases to either at or below 70 percent of the previous week’s daily average lands as the number of virus-related deaths reported in the capital rises at a rapid clip. And it comes on the heels of the central government extending the state of emergency until early March. “We will double-down on our anti-coronavirus measures, which should lead to lifting the state of emergency sooner,” Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike told reporters on Feb. 3, the day after the extension was announced. “We would like to welcome a nice spring with you all."" At an emergency news conference on Feb. 2, she said Tokyo will focus on two main pillars to get there: maintaining the shortened business hours for restaurants and bars, and expanding the number of people teleworking. MOST COMPLYING WITH EARLY CLOSURE REQUEST The metropolitan government started spot-checks of restaurants and bars in 13 bustling areas across Tokyo, including Shinjuku, Shibuya, Ikebukuro and Shinbashi, some of its busiest entertainment areas, on Jan. 18. Twenty Tokyo officials split into 10 groups are fanning out across the capital for visual checks of whether those eating and drinking establishments are, in fact, closed by the requested time on each weekday. Officials had checked 13,776 restaurants, bars and others by Feb. 1 and found that 96 percent, or 13,201, complied with the request to close their doors early. They plan to further expand the survey areas. That said, the total number of businesses to inspect is daunting. Tokyo has some 87,000 eating and drinking establishments eligible for government cash handouts for abiding by the early closure request, and sources said it is extremely difficult for them to check on all of them. “In my opinion, there is a trend that many business operators are cooperating with the requests of the shortened business hours,” one senior Tokyo official said. “We would like to keep this trend.” TELEWORKING STILL DIFFICULT On the other front, Tokyo faces a huge challenge getting more firms to adopt teleworking. After the second state of emergency was declared, Tokyo called on businesses to redouble their efforts to have their staff switch to remote work. Tokyo did a phone survey of companies in the capital with 30 employees or more, and about 400 responded. In January, 57 percent of respondents said that they had staff telecommuting, up six points from the previous month’s 51 percent. But last April, during the first state of emergency, 63 percent said they were adopting remote work. “We saw effective results at a certain level, but we would like to achieve a 70 percent reduction in the number of people coming to offices. We want to see a higher percentage in February than that of last April,” a Tokyo official said. But among companies that have 99 employees or fewer, only 47 percent said they have allowed their employees to work from home. Tokyo is asking companies that are finding it difficult to switch to teleworking for the full workday to adopt teleworking for just half the day, or on an hourly basis, and rotate the shifts. DEATHS SPIKING IN TOKYO DUE TO COVID-19 Despite Tokyo’s efforts to improve the infection situation through a variety of virus countermeasures, the number of the deaths of COVID-19 patients in the capital is soaring. Tokyo’s number of COVID-related deaths reached 259 for the month of January--almost double the previous month. Of that figure, 121 deaths resulted from infections that had spread within facilities, such as hospitals and nursing homes for the elderly. Many of these are elderly people in their 70s or older, who are at a higher risk of developing serious conditions because of their age. Their demographic is accounting for more and more of the total number of new infections, a concerning development that has put Tokyo on high alert. The Tokyo metropolitan government held steady at the highest alert level on the four-scale warning system for its infection situation and medical supply capacity at the Feb. 4 monitoring meeting. The number of deaths in the capital reached 98 for the week ending Feb. 1. Officials said at the meeting that the number had increased sharply from the previous week, when 68 people died, which was also up from the 39 deaths the week before that. The metropolitan government said it has officially confirmed a total of 974 deaths between Feb. 26 last year, when the first death was recorded in the capital, and Feb. 4. Tokyo added 34 deaths in November, when the third wave is believed to have started, but in December the number of deaths was pushed even higher, reaching 138. January saw 259 deaths. On Feb. 2, 23 people died in a single day, followed by 32 deaths on Feb. 3, breaking the two-day record. On Feb. 4, another 25 people died. The Asahi Shimbun analyzed the 259 deaths that happened in January. Of these, 86 percent, or 224 people, were 70 or older. Broken down by the route of infection, 121 people, half the total, became infected in facilities. Of those people, 76 patients became infected at hospitals, while 45 patients picked up the virus in nursing homes for the elderly. The data shows that the number of elderly patients developing serious conditions is increasing.

1,Irregular staff at major bar and eatery chains to get virus subsidy,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"February 5, 2021 at 18:11 JST"," Part-time and other irregular workers at major chain restaurants and bars who lost work hours due to the COVID-19 pandemic will be eligible for government support money, the Health, Labor and Welfare Ministry announced Feb. 5. The workers can apply for compensation for lost wages dating back to Jan. 8 when Japan's second state of emergency over the pandemic began, the ministry said. Plans call for accepting applications from workers starting in late February. Until now, the support program had only covered workers at small businesses. Major companies are obligated to pay allowances to workers they ask to stay home because of the pandemic. But many part-time and irregular workers at major restaurant chains had said their companies were not delivering on those allowances and called on the government to expand the support program. Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga on Feb. 4 said the government was moving toward expanding the program to part-time and other irregular workers at major companies, during a session of the Lower House Budget Committee. There had been concern that if such workers received financial support, their companies would then not fulfill their obligations to pay them allowances for staying home. But the new measure will only be limited to irregular workers. With many bars and restaurants shortening business hours or closing temporarily, part-time workers and people hired by the day have taken a large hit to their incomes, but some were unable to receive the government support money because they were employed by major companies. Suga, at the Budget Committee session, said that it was the responsibility of politicians to protect jobs and the livelihoods of the people.

The Japanese government in December signed a contract to procure 120 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine, enough for 60 million people. The company is requesting special approval for the vaccine and plans to submit further data to regulators in March, it said in a statement. The AstraZeneca element is a critical component in the government’s inoculation plan before the Tokyo Olympics scheduled for this summer: the doses will be made mostly in Japan, and don’t need to be kept refrigerated at the ultra-cold temperatures required for the Pfizer formula. AstraZeneca, which developed the vaccine with the University of Oxford, started clinical trials in Japan last summer, recruiting 256 volunteers. Japan has secured rights to at least 564 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines from Western developers, the biggest quantity in Asia and more than enough for its 126 million population. But Japan has lagged behind other major economies in starting its COVID-19 inoculation campaign, partly because of its dependence on overseas makers and its requirement of domestic clinical trials for all vaccine candidates.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14166143

1,Virus-minded lawmakers take aim at smoking area in Diet,['By RYUICHI YAMASHITA/ Staff Writer'],"February 5, 2021 at 16:10 JST"," Near a sign featuring the national anti-virus mantra of “avoid the three Cs,” smokers, including some of the rule makers, engage in close-range conversations in a confined, crowded and poorly ventilated space. The transparent smoking booth near the entrance of the Lower House chamber in the Diet building in Tokyo remains a sanctuary for health protocol breakers despite the risk of novel coronavirus contamination. But they may soon lose such special treatment, as some lawmakers have demanded the removal of the “smoking box.” Takae Ito, an Upper House member of the opposition Democratic Party for the People, told the Upper House Budget Committee on Jan. 28 that the smoking booth shows “how much the Diet is out of touch with the general public.” The central government’s panel of experts dealing with the novel coronavirus pandemic has listed five scenes that pose a high infection risk. One of them is a smoking area. Lawmakers, staff members of political parties and news reporters often flock to the booth and pull down their masks to get their nicotine fixes. The masks are rarely put back on when they talk to each other. “Smoking and talking without a mask at a rest area at worksites constitutes a risk of infection,” Takaji Wakita, head of the National Institute of Infectious Diseases, said at an Upper House Cabinet Committee meeting on Feb. 2. However, Lower House officials said there is no problem because “there is a note posted at the entrance of the smoking zone that warns people to keep a proper distance from each other when smoking.” The officials also noted that curtain-like partitions were placed inside the smoking zone on Feb. 2 with a note that says, “Please use alone in order to prevent infections from spreading.” The revised Health Promotion Law that took effect in April 2020 aims to curb passive smoking in public spaces and prevent another C, cancer. Executive branches and administrative agencies were required to follow the tightened regulations on secondhand smoke. But the smoking zone in the Diet building was allowed to stay unchanged. The general public can take tours of the Diet building, but they are told: “Smoking is prohibited inside the building as a general rule, except at designated smoking rooms.” Under the central government’s original proposal, all smoking would be banned in the Diet building as well as in ministries and agencies, with no exceptions. However, the proposal was changed during a preliminary review of the bill. “The government has forced people to telework and refrain from dining out,” Yuichiro Tamaki, head of the Democratic Party for the People, said at a news conference on Feb. 4. “We, too, have to do everything we can do. The (smoking booth) should be removed.”",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14165626

1,Virus-infected assemblywoman stung by callous online society,['By YOSUKE SASAKI/ Staff Writer'],"February 5, 2021 at 07:10 JST"," TSU, Mie Prefecture--After calling for an end to bullying over possible COVID-19 cases, Sayuri Yamaji, a city assemblywoman here, had to deal directly with another social problem associated with the pandemic. “Rumors, rumors, rumors,” Yamaji, 50, said. “I just couldn’t believe they came up with so many unfounded things.” She felt she had done everything right after becoming infected with the novel coronavirus but fell victim to a prevailing lack of compassion shown during the health crisis. During a city assembly session in September last year, Yamaji noted that anxiety was increasing among students and their guardians that they could be viewed as infected and become targets of bullying if school personnel had come in close contact with novel coronavirus carriers. She urged the city assembly to take steps to prevent such situations from happening. The next day, Yamaji suddenly felt lethargic in her home, but she thought it was caused by her exhaustion from work. At night, she developed a headache and her body aches became severe. Although she thought she just had a cold because of her persistent mild fever, she took a polymerase chain reaction test just in case. She tested positive for COVID-19. Yamaji said she had no idea where she could have contracted the virus. Still feeling ill, Yamaji prepared for her hospital stay and explained the situation to her family. She also recalled the places she had visited and anyone who might have had close contact with her after she felt sick. But she thought her top priority was to prevent herself from spreading the illness. If she remained anonymous as the 466th case of COVID-19 in the prefecture, and only her basic information, such as age group, gender, municipality of her residence and occupation, was announced, another Tsu city assemblywoman in her 50s could have been mistakenly identified as the patient. Therefore, Yamaji did not hesitate to announce her real name. Soon after her announcement, Yamaji saw rumors spreading on social media that she became infected at a restaurant and that she visited a live music club. She did have a discussion at the restaurant with its owner for about 10 minutes and attended a meeting on support measures for musical events. But she didn't eat or drink at the restaurant or visit any music venues. Yamaji felt indignant about the out-of-control groundless rumors, and she felt sorry for restaurant operators and event organizers affected by these untruths. Although she tried not to check social media, worried acquaintances contacted her to warn her of online comments. As she recovered from the disease, the rumors that reached her decreased. However, it is impossible to erase all rumors, even if completely false, from the internet. The assemblywoman said she feels that compassion for others is essential to prevent such troubles from occurring. “Can you spread groundless rumors about your own family or someone you care about?” Yamaji asked. “How would you feel if someone does that to you?”",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14132894
0,London Boots comedian quits torch relay over remarks by Mori,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"February 4, 2021 at 19:08 JST"," A popular comedian who is a prospective Olympic torch relay runner backed out of the event, citing his disgust at remarks made by the head of the Games’ organizing committee, Yoshiro Mori. Atsushi Tamura, a member of comedic duo London Boots, who is a regular on many TV and radio programs, on Feb. 3 announced that he will quit his role as an Olympic torch bearer on his social media accounts. Tamura, 47, in a video posted on his YouTube channel, cited several remarks made recently by Mori, president of the Tokyo Organizing Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games. One was Mori’s comment at a Feb. 2 meeting with lawmakers of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, during which he said, “We will hold the Olympics, regardless of how the coronavirus (situation) looks.” Tamura said he felt what Mori said was ""incomprehensible"" and ignored public sentiment. Mori also mentioned the Olympic torch relay, scheduled to start from Fukushima Prefecture on March 25 and continue throughout the nation until the Games' opening ceremony in July. To prevent crowds from gathering along the relay routes in order to lower the risk of novel coronavirus infections, Mori said: “Popular celebrities should run where not many people will gather. Somebody said, 'How about running the routes in the middle of rice fields?' But others said it would attract more people because rice paddies are spacious.” Tamura said the comment stuck in his mind. ""I'm not sure if it was a joke"" Tamura said in the video. ""But making remarks like this so casually is such a turnoff.” “I just can’t go along with (what Mori said). And it's an insult to farmers as well,” he added. Tamura said talents perform a task with an awareness of their power to influence people. “If there's no need to bring people out to the torch relay routes, I think celebrities shouldn't be a part of it,” Tamura said. Tamura stressed he is not opposed to staging the Olympics, but favors delaying it due to the COVID-19 pandemic. “I hope the Games will be held, but I’m one of those who think it should be postponed (again),” he said. “Containing the coronavirus pandemic and setting things straight is the most urgent thing right now, more than anything else.” Tamura was scheduled to run the torch relay’s portion in Inuyama, Aichi Prefecture. Tamura has been known for his love of castles and serves as a special tourism ambassador of the city, which has Inuyama Castle, a national treasure originally built in 1537. The portion of the torch relay that runs through Inuyama is expected to finish at the castle, and Tamura was supposed to be the final runner. Tamura said on the website of the prefectural torch relay organizing committee that the castle “is not big but radiates an aura,” and he hopes to “help convey the appeal of the castle to people in Japan and abroad.” “I was looking forward to (seeing him in the relay), but I respect his feelings and decision,” said Inuyama Mayor Takuro Yamada, who recommended Tamura to be a torch bearer, after Tamura notified the city of his withdrawal. Mori, 83, in the meantime, has been busy spatting over the misogynistic remarks he made on Feb. 3, when a t a Japan Olympic Committee Council meeting he ridiculed female board members and said they were ""annoying"" as they tended to talk too long in meetings. At a news conference where he halfheartedly apologized for the comments, Mori was asked about Tamura’s decision. The former prime minister said he told the lawmakers that, ""It is a good thing if popular celebrities decline to run where people gather."" Asked if he wants other torch bearers to still participate in the relay, Mori said, “I’m not in the position to say, 'I want you to run,' or, 'I don’t want you to run.'” Rather, he said, that decision will be left up to local organizers to make. “I have no idea at all who's running in the relay,” the Olympic chief said.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14162962

The ministry pledged to overhaul the system and fix the problem by as early as mid-February. It said the bug has not affected iPhone users. The glitch came after a Sept. 28 update of the COCOA app, according to the ministry. The app notifies users if they have been in the company of other users who registered positive test results for the virus on the app. Such contact would be for more than 15 minutes within a radius of 1 meter. But the notification function has not been working for Android users, even if they have been in close contact with those who register positive tests, the ministry said. The bug remained undiscovered because the app functioned properly in simulated operation tests conducted by a company commissioned for the maintenance of the app system, the ministry added. Since January, many Android users have reported that they have not received any notifications from the app despite their contact with infected people. The company tested the app on smartphones and found the glitch. “We failed to immediately discover the bug because the app was not tested on actual devices,” a ministry official said. The app had been downloaded about 24.6 million times, and 10,015 users registered positive tests on the app as of Feb. 2. Android users account for 30 percent, or 7.7 million, of the downloads.

0,"1,000 companies go bankrupt as virus continues to rage in Japan",['By SHINJI HAKOTANI/ Staff Writer'],"February 3, 2021 at 17:59 JST"," A total of 1,000 companies have now gone bankrupt in Japan due to causes related to the COVID-19 pandemic, the latest count by a credit reporting agency showed. The figure includes businesses preparing to file for bankruptcy and those that had debts of less than 10 million yen ($95,200), according to data released on Feb. 2 by Tokyo Shoko Research Ltd. Unlike the global financial crisis triggered by the 2008 collapse of U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers, which sent many listed companies into bankruptcy in Japan, it is mostly small- and midsize businesses that have gone bankrupt due to the current health crisis. Companies with fewer than five employees account for roughly half of the pandemic-related bankruptcies, while only 5 percent or so were filed by those with 50 or more employees. The government’s financial support has helped small businesses stay afloat. But their business conditions will likely remain tough as a one-month extension of the state of emergency was announced on Feb. 2 for 10 prefectures, including Tokyo. Many companies had managed to postpone declaring bankruptcy thanks to unsecured loans whose interest rates are practically zero and cash handouts provided by the government, according to Tokyo Shoko Research. “Financial institutions will likely become more reluctant to provide additional loans to businesses as many companies cannot foresee whether they can rebuild their core business,” said a Tokyo Shoko Research official involved in compiling the bankruptcy data. “The number of bankruptcies may increase further from around this spring.” The first bankruptcy resulting from the fallout from the COVID-19 crisis was filed in late February last year. The number of pandemic-related bankruptcy cases rose to 500 by mid-September and about four months later has reached 1,000. The figure has remained high, hovering around the 100 mark on a monthly basis since September. By business type, most bankruptcies were in the restaurant industry, at 182, followed by 83 in the construction sector and 62 in the hotel and inn industry. The data shows the service sector has been hit hardest by the pandemic due to a plunge in the number of foreign tourists to Japan and stay-at-home requests by the authorities. By prefecture, 247 of the bankruptcies were in Tokyo, followed by 94 in Osaka and 55 in Kanagawa. Only nine of the country’s 47 prefectures had fewer than five bankruptcies, with Yamanashi reporting the lowest, with only one.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14159624

He made the comment at a Feb. 3 joint meeting of the Upper House’s Cabinet Committee and the Committee on Health, Welfare and Labor, called to examine proposed revisions to a special measures law regarding the novel coronavirus pandemic. Nao made the remark in response to a question from Mizuho Fukushima, head of the Social Democratic Party of Japan, regarding the central government’s request for bars and restaurants to close at 8 p.m. to contain the pandemic. “Diet members are staying at an Italian restaurant until 9 p.m.,” Fukushima said. “Are you saying that under the revised law, the customers will not be punished but businesses will be sanctioned with an administrative penalty?” After Nao answered, Fukushima replied, “Then, if a business says it cannot close ‘because a customer is staying,’ it will be exempt from the administrative penalty.” Under the proposed revision of the special measures law regarding the novel coronavirus pandemic, businesses will be required to pay a non-criminal fine if they do not comply with the request from the local governor to shorten their business hours amid a state of emergency.

The pandemic has made thermal cameras to check peoples' temperatures and video monitors displaying the results ubiquitous at the entrances of companies and government offices. But the gear installed at the Nagasaki prefectural government building is creating a buzz for all the wrong reasons, as its readings are showing much cooler heads than expected among those who enter. One morning in late January, a man wearing a black coat hurried into the building's third-floor entrance and stopped in front of the thermal camera. He was stunned to find his temperature a heart-stopping low 27 degrees. The security guard standing nearby didn't bat an eye. The cameras have become a hot topic among prefectural government officials for often recording temperatures under 30 degrees. Responding to the spread of the third wave of the novel coronavirus, the Nagasaki prefectural government installed thermal cameras at four entrances to the building on Jan. 7. The system including the video monitors cost 8,167,136 yen ($77,800). The system is set to sound an alarm whenever someone with a temperature over 37.5 degrees attempts to enter the building. But a day after it was installed, people began saying the temperatures it displayed were abnormally low. The cameras are designed to measure the temperature on the skin's surface so anyone coming to the government building on a cold day would have a low temperature because their skin had still not warmed up. Government employees at the building found most people had readings of 30 degrees, after they compared their results from the system with one another. The average normal human body temperature is generally 36.5 to 37.5 degrees. Some working in the social welfare and public health section in charge of health care professionals have raised questions about whether there was any meaning to having the equipment. “In the morning, it never shows a temperature that reaches 30 degrees,"" one security guard at the building said. Another guard said concerns about the body temperatures have likely already been raised because of how unusual the results have been. Those in the section handling asset management admit they never expected the thermal cameras to produce results about 10 degrees lower than actual body temperatures. On the last Sunday in January, the thermal cameras were moved about three meters to the side of the entrance to lengthen the time between entering the building and taking the temperature of people coming in.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14159500

Like clockwork, streams of workers, students and others looking to ease their stress head to public parks in the area after 8 p.m., when bars and restaurants are supposed to close to prevent the spread of novel coronavirus infections. The Shinbashi district, filled with countless bars and restaurants, is known as a nightlife heaven for salarymen. But the doors have shut and the lights turned off at many of these places at 8 p.m. since the COVID-19 state of emergency was declared for Tokyo and three surrounding prefectures on Jan. 7. After that hour on Feb. 1, one small park surrounded by office buildings not far from JR Shinbashi Station turned into a comfortable drinking place for 20 or so. One group of drinkers, still wearing their winter coats, chatted and laughed over canned beer and bottled wine. Young adults occupied a slide in the park to discuss their love lives, while a lonely-looking man drank on a bench by himself. A security guard at the park said the number of drinkers increases to around 80 on Friday nights. Such scenes are expected to continue under the extended state of emergency. “I’m about to graduate from university soon, but I don’t have a place where I can talk about memories with my friends,” said one imbiber in a group of four students who want the government to ease restrictions on bars and restaurants, if possible. They were all university students who became acquainted through a school activity club. They stood in a circle near the slide, drinking beer and white wine. Learning that the state of emergency would continue for one more month to March 7 in 10 prefectures, including Tokyo, the group member said, “I expected it, but still it’s sad.” The member said the pandemic has taken a serious toll on student life. The club will not resume its activities anytime soon and a scheduled graduation trip would have to be canceled. The students started the party at 6 p.m. at a nearby wine bar to celebrate a member’s birthday, but the place closed at 8 p.m. on the metropolitan government’s request. “We haven’t drunk enough, have we?” one of them said as they left the bar. They then went to the park, and additional refreshments were bought at a convenience store. When asked if the park party could spread the novel coronavirus, they noted that they were wearing masks when talking. “We’re outside, so ventilation is no problem,” a 22-year-old male student said. “Cut us some slack on things like this, will you?” DRINKING ESSENTIAL FOR BUSINESS Two men in their 40s who work at a real estate company in Tokyo’s Minato Ward were drinking canned beer on a bench in the Shinbashi park. They said they started drinking at a yakitori restaurant at around 6:30 p.m. after work. But last call came immediately. They hastily gulped their beers, which left them unfulfilled. “It upset our digestive systems, so we came here for an after-party,” one of the men joked. They also said drinking is a serious business matter and essential for co-workers to exchange information, particularly now, ahead of the busy moving season for the real estate business. “Closing at 8 p.m. is really tough for company employees,” one of the drinkers said. “Sometimes, hobnobbing makes things go along more swimmingly. That’s why we are here tonight, drinking.” He said the extension of the state of emergency will further stress him out. “It’s really tough that I can’t stay for drinking at (bars and restaurants),” he lamented. “But I hear that front-line medical workers are having a hard time, too, even though the number of infections has decreased.

1,Medical expert says not every dining gathering carries same risk,['By SACHIKO MIWA/ Staff Writer'],"February 3, 2021 at 16:50 JST"," A civil law and medical expert says that even though not all dining occasions pose the same risk of coronavirus infections, some bars and restaurants that are safer may still feel compelled to close under a government request. Shigeto Yonemura, a University of Tokyo professor who is also a medical doctor, raised concerns in the Diet a bout legal provisions targeting all bars and restaurants that do not cooperate with government requests to shorten business hours. He appeared as an expert witness at the Upper House Cabinet Committee on Feb. 2 that was deliberating legislation to revise the special measures law to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic as well as the Infectious Diseases Prevention Law. One provision would include fines for bars and restaurants that refuse to cooperate. “There is the issue of whether all eateries and all opportunities to wine and dine pose the same degree of danger,” Yonemura said. “I believe there are dining occasions that could be considered dangerous as well as those that are not.” He said the risk of infection would vary depending on how many people were gathered together as a group as well as the ventilation equipment and layout of the establishment. Yonemura pointed out that a fundamental principle of Criminal Law was to only hand out penalties for acts that are clearly dangerous and that the principle also applied to administrative fines. He said that if all eateries were targeted, those that have a low infection risk would feel inclined to temporarily cease operations to make the regulations effective and to gain the understanding of the public. Yonemura also touched upon past Supreme Court rulings. He said while there was no need to compensate businesses that continued operating at high levels of danger, it was only logical that there was a need to compensate for the losses of businesses with low levels of danger who are cooperating with requests to shorten business hours. He also raised doubts about the effectiveness of fines against individuals who refused to cooperate with studies to track infection routes to ascertain who that individual came in close contact with. He said such penalties would have the opposite effect in controlling infections and may lead people to avoid testing and refrain from visiting their doctor. “I have doubts about whether it is appropriate to force people to divulge information related to their privacy while using the threat of penalties as the incentive,” Yonemura said.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14159749

During his news conference on Feb. 2, Suga apologized to the public for failing to bring the COVID-19 health crisis under control before the original state of emergency deadline of Feb. 7 for 11 prefectures. Tochigi will be the only prefecture to have the state of emergency lifted on that day. Suga called on businesses and the public to more thoroughly implement the measures the government has called for until now. They include shortening business hours of bars and restaurants, avoiding unnecessary outings, working from home, and limiting the number of participants at events. The government panel of experts dealing with the novel coronavirus pandemic met on Feb. 2 to give its green light for extending the state of emergency. Panel members acknowledged that the number of infections linked to eateries has decreased, but they also expressed concern about the rising number of infection clusters at medical institutions and facilities providing care to senior citizens. The increase of infections among elderly people who are more prone to developing serious COVID-19 symptoms and requiring hospitalization has tightened the situation at medical facilities. The government’s basic direction to deal with the pandemic does include new measures to free up hospital beds for COVID-19 patients. One plan is to secure openings at other hospitals and nursing care facilities for patients whose condition has improved. Shuya Nomura, a professor at the Chuo University Law School who is knowledgeable about crisis management, said the government must clarify the steps it intends to take to ease the suffering of the public. “The government has not made a sufficient effort to increase the number of hospital beds or health care professionals,” Nomura said, referring to the strained medical care situation. Toshiko Kikkawa, a professor of risk communications at Keio University’s Faculty of Business and Commerce, said the government was depending excessively on the capabilities of the medical care structure. “There are no specific standards for lifting the state of emergency or a plan for the future,” she said. She added that the government should publicize the results of its analysis regarding whether the decline in new COVID-19 cases was a result of an increasing number of people working from home or the shortening of business hours at bars and restaurants. The data should be used to inform the public about what actions they are being asked to take, Kikkawa said. The public has shown signs of growing weary of stay-at-home requests under the state of emergency. According to Tokyo-based Agoop Corp., a Softbank Group subsidiary that tracks people’s movements through GPS data on their mobile phones, the number of people around major train stations decreased just after the state of emergency was declared for Tokyo and three neighboring prefectures on Jan. 7. But there has since been a gradual increase in foot traffic in the greater Tokyo metropolitan area, according to the data.

She is not alone. Many COVID-19 patients living on their own in the capital are left to fend for themselves at home while battling the disease due to a shortage of hospital beds and health care workers that has resulted from the recent surge in infections. The cumulative number of COVID-19 cases topped 100,000 on Feb. 1 in Tokyo, where single-person households account for about 47 percent of all households. With growing fear that she could die if her condition did not improve, the woman called the Tokyo metropolitan government’s consultation center for COVID-19 patients whose condition has worsened while recuperating at home. It took her more than 30 minutes to get through to a staff member. She then asked the person if she could receive inpatient treatment or recuperate at a hotel. But the consultation center employee told her that she was ineligible as she was “fit enough to make a phone call.” The woman then broke down, sobbing in bed. She had tested positive for the novel coronavirus two days before calling the consultation center. A public health center instructed her to recuperate at home since she did not have symptoms other than a fever of around 37.5 degrees. The public health center also told her that she would soon recover because she was young, the woman said. SURVIVING ON JELLY AND WATER But her condition suddenly worsened. She kept focused on controlling her breathing all day long for about four days. She was also feeling heavy in the stomach and could only consume jelly and water that her parents, living outside Tokyo, ordered through an online shopping site for delivery to her home. The public health center had told her that it would call her to check on her condition, but she had not heard from them. She kept in touch with her parents on the Line messaging app, but they were unable to immediately come to her assistance even in the event of an emergency. The situation led her to become overwhelmed by a growing sense of anxiety and despair. Fortunately, however, her symptoms eased several days later. Under the health ministry’s directive, COVID-19 patients are no longer required to rest at home or at other accommodation facilities if 10 days have passed since they first developed symptoms and it has been 72 hours since their symptoms were alleviated. The public health center called the woman on Jan. 7, 10 days after she developed symptoms, to give her permission to go out from the following day. Now she is returning to the life she had before contracting the virus, but still has an impaired sense of taste and smell. The woman said she understood that hospital beds for COVID-19 patients are in short supply due to the recent spike in infections, but lamented the lack of support from public health officials. “I felt like they were taking my infection lightly, assuming that young people don't become seriously ill,” she said. “I wanted them to provide more support to patients living alone.” MORE THAN 3,000 ON BED WAITING LIST A total of 26,130 COVID-19 patients were recuperating at home in Japan as of Jan. 27, according to the health ministry. The figure has surged with the spread of the virus and nearly tripled over the past month. The number is particularly high in Tokyo, with 4,692 patients resting at home as of Feb. 1, according to the Tokyo metropolitan government. The capital also has 3,472 patients waiting for admission to a hospital or an accommodation facility to recuperate, mainly due to no hospital beds being available to treat them. How to deal with patients whose condition has worsened while resting at home has proven a major challenge. Numerous patients were reported to have taken a sudden turn for the worse while recuperating at home. A total of 18 had died in such circumstances in Tokyo by January's end. The incidents prompted the Tokyo metropolitan government to step up monitoring of and support for patients resting at home. The metropolitan government has been monitoring the condition of the patients via Line, while distributing food items to them, such as water and instant noodles. It has also kept the telephone consultation center operating around the clock. The government had provided these measures only in some areas, but expanded them to cover all parts of the capital on Jan. 25.

0,"Infection cases declining, but ratio of elderly patients rising",['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"February 2, 2021 at 17:29 JST"," The number of new COVID-19 cases has been on a downward trend since mid-January, but the ratio of elderly patients--those most at risk of serious symptoms--has risen, a health ministry advisory panel said. The panel on Feb. 1 said the tallies of new infection cases over the past week in Tokyo and the surrounding prefectures of Saitama, Chiba and Kanagawa have decreased to 50 to 60 percent of their peak counts. Takaji Wakita, head of the National Institute of Infectious Diseases who chairs the advisory panel, noted that the COVID-19 situation was particularly severe in the first half of January. “Because of year-end dinner parties and homecoming visits, the number of infections skyrocketed regardless of age,” Wakita said. “The number has decreased since then, but we need to see if the trend will continue.” One gauge of the COVID-19 situation is the effective reproduction number. If the figure is below one, it indicates that the number of new infections has declined. As of Jan. 15, the effective reproduction number was 0.80 nationwide. The figure was 0.79 in Tokyo and 10 prefectures under the state of emergency, and 0.84 in all other prefectures. However, the number of patients with severe symptoms was a record-high 1,043 as of Jan. 26. Health officials are concerned about the rising percentages of elderly COVID-19 patients. According to data compiled by the health ministry, during the week from Jan. 3, people 60 years old and older accounted for about 20 percent of new COVID-19 patients, while more than 50 percent were 39 or younger. But during the week between Jan. 17 and Jan. 23, people 60 or older accounted for around 30 percent of the total. “Infections have not decreased among people who are in their 80s and 90s,” the advisory panel said, warning that the number of patients with severe symptoms as well as the number of deaths will likely increase. The health ministry said 196 cluster infections were reported at elderly care facilities over the four-week period from Dec. 7 to Jan. 4. During the three-week period from Jan. 4, the number jumped to 253. “The anti-virus measures have produced a certain effect, and the cases where people contract the virus from dining and wining have declined,” Wakita said. “Meanwhile, the number of infection cases at care facilities has been increasing a lot.” A central government panel of experts dealing with the COVID-19 crisis uses a 4-stage system for six barometers to determine the novel coronavirus situation in a given area. According to data compiled by the Cabinet Secretariat, none of the 11 prefectures under the state of emergency was in the most serious stage 4 level for all six barometers as of Jan. 28. In Chiba Prefecture, five of the six barometers were at stage 4. Four barometers remained at stage 4 in Tokyo and Kanagawa and Osaka prefectures, while three barometers were at stage 4 in Saitama, Kyoto and Fukuoka prefectures. Yoshihito Niki, a visiting professor of infectious diseases at Showa University, said: “The effects of issuing the state of emergency have been seen, although slowly. But if the government lifts it hastily, people will become relaxed, leading to a fourth wave of the pandemic. ” He recommended waiting and checking the infection situation for at least another month.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14156596

The last time the count was below 400 was on Dec. 21, when 392 new cases were reported. The latest figure pushed up the accumulated total of cases to 100,234, the most of any prefecture in the nation, and the first to push past 100,000. There have been steep spikes in new infections in the capital since late last year, which has propelled the total number of new cases in January to about 40,000. The figure compared with about 10,000 in November and about 20,000 in December, showing that the spread of the virus has accelerated since the third wave of infections from late autumn. The positivity rate jumped to 14.5 percent on Jan. 7 from between 3 percent and 4 percent in early November. As cases surged, medical facilities in the capital were inundated with COVID-19 patients. As of Nov. 1, 1,013 patients were hospitalized. But the number of hospitalizations swelled to 3,427 on Jan. 12. As of Jan. 31, 2,891 patients were hospitalized. Of the patients hospitalized, those in serious condition increased, placing a heavy strain on the capital's medical system. Tokyo defines serious cases as patients requiring ventilators or an extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) device, which circulates blood through an artificial lung.

1,No lack of hospital beds in Japan unless you have the coronavirus,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"January 31, 2021 at 18:39 JST"," On a per-capita basis, Japan has no shortage of hospital beds. Yet, thousands of individuals with COVID-19 are self-isolating at home or hotels with little access to treatment as hospitals remain overwhelmed with patients following a surge in new cases since late last year. It all comes down to bean counters and the bottom line. COVID-19 patients require more intensive care than general patients, meaning it is not cost-effective to accept large numbers of people with the virus. A private hospital in Osaka Prefecture that began treating patients with the novel coronavirus in July, but only those with mild or moderate symptoms, illustrates the extent of the problem. Five of its 400 or so beds are set aside for such cases. The hospital had been operating in the black, but reported about 150 million yen ($1.44 million) in losses during the April-June quarter. This was due to a 30-percent decline in the number of outpatients when people started avoiding going to the hospital following the first wave of infections last spring. After the first wave plateaued, patients began returning, raising the hospital's economic outlook. Then the third wave of infections hit in autumn, filling up most of the beds set aside for COVID-19 patients. The facility receives about 70,000 yen per patient with the novel coronavirus in health care services paid to medical institutions under the public medical insurance system. Although the figure is higher than the 50,000 yen the hospital gets for a patient with pneumonia, it is not nearly enough, given the greater care COVID-19 patients require, according to the head of the hospital’s general affairs department. “They need twice as much care as patients with pneumonia,” the official said. The medical institution would need to assign more nurses to care for those with COVID-19. To do so, the hospital would be left with no choice but to limit the availability of treatment of patients with other illnesses. Private hospitals account for most of the nation's medical institutions. They represent two-thirds of the 4,255 hospitals nationwide that are capable of treating patients in the acute stage. Health ministry data in November showed that about 40 percent of those hospitals said they can accept COVID-19 patients. But of the privately owned hospitals, only 21 percent were able to. In contrast, 83 percent of public-supported institutions and 71 percent of those run by local governments said they can accept COVID-19 patients. Takao Aizawa, president of the Japan Hospital Association, noted that private hospitals are reluctant to accept COVID-19 patients out of economic considerations. “Most private hospitals are small or midsize,” he said. “If they convert one of their wards to treat COVID-19 patients, it will directly hit their bottom line. They are different from public hospitals, which can be sustained with an injection of taxpayer money even when they keep losing money.” Another factor is a shortage of medical personnel who can be assigned to treat patients with the novel coronavirus. Even though there are about 100,000 hospital beds in Tokyo, authorities have faced huge difficulties trying to secure beds for COVID-19 patients because of a shortfall in medical personnel. In particular, facilities designated to handle serious coronavirus cases play a crucial role in the health care system that other hospitals cannot because they can also treat patients with other serious illnesses and perform surgery such as organ transplantation. In light of this, assigning emergency doctors and those who can provide highly specialized care to treat patients with the coronavirus is not deemed practical, according to medical experts. It turns out there is a dire shortage of intensive care specialists able to treat COVID-19 patients in ICUs. According to the Japanese Society of Intensive Care Medicine (JSICM), Germany, with a population of 80 million, has about 8,000 intensive care specialists. In contrast, there are only around 2,000 in Japan, which has a population of 126 million. “In Japan, the number of intensive care beds at each hospital is limited and intensive care specialists are scattered,” said Osamu Nishida, president of the JSICM. “These factors pose enormous difficulties in securing beds for patients with the coronavirus.” To add to the challenge is the central government’s seeming inability to craft a response based on swiftly changing circumstances. Health minister Norihisa Tamura, at a Jan. 28 meeting of the Upper House Budget Committee, expressed regret for the central government's lack of preparedness. “The central government should have moved aggressively to secure more beds in anticipation of a sharp spike in new cases following the year-end break,” he said.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14151132

1,Researchers find candidate for antiviral to the new coronavirus,['By YUKO MATSUURA/ Staff Writer'],"January 29, 2021 at 18:25 JST"," A team of researchers has discovered two chemical compounds that can block the novel coronavirus from replicating--potentially a major milestone in the development of new drugs to fight the virus. Results from a test tube experiment show that the chemical compounds identified have little toxicity and are more effective when combined with an existing remedy, according to the team led by scientists from the National Center for Global Health and Medicine. “While we have no remedies yet that can fundamentally help patients recover, we have found prospective candidate substances,” said Hiroaki Mitsuya, who spearheaded the research. The team focused on a chemical compound that can inhibit the activity of protease, enzymes that break up proteins. It was effective when used against another kind of coronavirus: the one responsible for SARS. The researchers created about 400 kinds of chemical compounds artificially that work similarly. The scientists injected them into cells infected with the new coronavirus--the one that causes COVID-19--and studied how they affected the virus’ proliferation. The team found two chemical compounds had blocked the virus from multiplying effectively, called “GRL-1720” and “GRL-2420 (5h).” GRL-2420 (5h) was able to almost completely block the virus from replicating when used alongside remdesivir, a drug used as a treatment for COVID-19. Mitsuya said they are seeking to develop new drugs and continue with their research through animal testing.

The 15-day tournament will be held at Ryogoku Kokugikan in Tokyo instead of Edion Arena Osaka, the traditional spring venue. The JSA board of directors cited the travel risk posed to large groups and the shorter preparation period for wrestlers. The directors weighed the difficulty of taking the same COVID-19 preventative measures at Edion Arena Osaka as at Ryogoku Kokugikan. According to the JSA, virus experts who visited the Osaka venue said, “It is difficult to do so.” It plans to hold the spring tournament without changing the competition schedule from March 14 for 15 days with a reduced number of spectators. The regular sumo tournament is held six times a year, and of the six, three are held outside Tokyo. However, the last tournament held outside the capital was the spring tournament in Osaka in March 2020, without spectators. The July and November tournaments, which are traditionally held in Nagoya and Fukuoka, respectively, were also moved to Tokyo last year. The sport has been rocked by the novel coronavirus pandemic. Ahead of the New Year Grand Sumo Tournament, which concluded on Jan. 24, 65 wrestlers from four stables were forced to drop out after some members of their stables tested positive for the coronavirus.

1,Medical group chief warns Feb. 7 is too early to lift emergency,['By RYUICHI HISANAGA/ Staff Writer'],"January 28, 2021 at 18:31 JST"," The head of the Japan Medical Association (JMA) is warning it would be premature to lift the state of emergency in effect for Tokyo and 10 prefectures on the day it is set to expire. “Lifting the declaration on Feb. 7 is unrealistic,” Toshio Nakagawa, JMA president, said at a news conference on Jan. 27, in a call for the central government to extend the state of emergency and to adopt stronger criteria for lifting it. The Tokyo metropolitan government announced on Jan. 27 that it confirmed fewer than 1,000 new patients infected with the novel coronavirus in the capital. But Nakagawa warned that people “should not be relieved” by the relatively lower numbers. “Some people seem to have the impression that there are far fewer new cases now, but that’s because they have become numb to the COVID-19 pandemic,” Nakagawa said. “The recent numbers of new patients are still several times more than they were when the first state of emergency was declared last spring or during the summer.” At an Upper House Budget Committee meeting held the same day, Yasutoshi Nishimura, the state minister in charge of economic revitalization and responding to the coronavirus crisis, laid out the government’s criteria for lifting the state of emergency. “We will make a comprehensive decision on the timing, partly based on the Stage 3 indicators,” he said. Stage 3 is the second-worst category in the government’s four-stage scale for gauging the seriousness of the outbreak. Nishimura said that six indicators, including the hospital bed occupancy rate and the number of recuperating patients, will need to drop from Stage 4 to Stage 3. Nakagawa quoted Nishimura’s remarks and said, “We need to lift the state of emergency as carefully as possible.” He suggested the health care system should show more signs of improvement before deciding to lift the declaration. Nakagawa said the state of emergency should be lifted when all the six indicators “drop to the Stage 2 level, or at least are certain to drop to Stage 2.”",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14143115

The campaign will be one of the greatest vaccination programs in the country’s history. Local governments are already trying to overcome a number of stumbling blocks, including securing large sites and medical personnel for mass vaccinations while dealing with the constant threat of the contagion spreading in their areas. They say the central government, which plans to start inoculating medical workers with Pfizer Inc.’s vaccine in late February, is exacerbating the logistical nightmare with its lack of information and its indecision. The municipal government of Yokohama, a city with a population of 3.75 million, plans to set up at least one mass vaccination site in each of its 18 wards. City officials are drafting a plan that calls for residents to make reservations for inoculations to reduce crowd sizes at the sites and the risk of spreading the virus. A single shipment of the Pfizer vaccine to a vaccination site will contain a minimum of 1,170 doses. Officials need to ensure that enough residents will show up for a shot to avoid wasting the doses, which become ineffective days after they are thawed. Roughly 930,000 individuals 65 or older live in Yokohama. The central government recommends that vaccinating such individuals, who are at a higher risk of dying from COVID-19, be completed in nine weeks. But Yokohama city officials say preparing for that task is proving difficult, given the “scant information provided by the central government on how many vaccines will be available and when.” Yokohama is not the only local government confused by the central government’s lack of information and ever-changing briefings about vaccines. “If we have avenues to secure vaccines by ourselves, we can make efforts for that purpose, but that is not the case,” Aichi Governor Hideaki Omura said at a news conference on Jan. 22. “The central government should inform us early about when and how many vaccines will be shipped to us.” Gunma prefectural officials started preparations for the vaccine program in December, when they were told by the central government that a vaccination site should use all 1,170 doses distributed in one shipment. Based on that guidance, prefectural officials met with their municipal counterparts and representatives of local doctors’ associations to select medical institutions for the vaccination program as well as locations to store the vaccine shots in ultra-cold temperatures. But they were forced back to the drawing board earlier this month when the central government revised its guidance and said they do not need to use up all the doses shipped in one go. Saitama city officials envisaged sending vaccination coupons issued by the central government to elderly residents from March 1 based on the central government’s vaccination draft plan that would start inoculations for them in late March. However, at a Jan. 25 meeting for local officials, the central government revised its earlier explanation and moved back the mail delivery of the coupons to the middle of March. “The central government’s way of releasing information is incremental,” said an official in charge of Saitama’s vaccination campaign. “Each time, we are unable to know if the information provided is accurate. ” At a Jan. 25 new conference, Mie Governor Eikei Suzuki urged the central government to decide on whether doctors should stop treating their COVID-19 patients, noting that those doctors will take charge of administering the vaccine and may have to temporarily leave the hospitals. “If they have to take time off from treating patients, the central government should provide them with funding and compensation for having to do so,” he said. An official with the health care policy department of the Shiga prefectural government raised similar concerns about the expected absence of doctors for the inoculation process. “Health care personnel are treating patients not only with the coronavirus, but also with other illnesses,” the official said. “When they are absent for the vaccination program, how will hospitals be operated? We need to discuss this in detail.” The health care systems in depopulated areas are particularly ill-equipped to efficiently carry out the vaccination program. An official tasked with planning vaccinations with the Satsuma-Sendai city government in Kagoshima Prefecture said “the greatest challenge” will be securing personnel to administer the vaccine. “Doctors and nurses would need to travel to communities in mountainous areas to give vaccine shots to elderly people who have difficulty moving,” the official said. The Akita city government in the northern prefecture of Akita faces similar needs. The prefecture has the highest ratio of people 65 or older in the nation. Akita city, with a population of 304,000, has about 96,000 people in that age bracket. Of them, around 10,000 are bed-ridden or require high levels of care while living in long-term care facilities. “Doctors and nurses should be sent to those facilities to inoculate them,” the head of a public health care center in the city said. And booking large sites for mass vaccinations will be no easy task. “We are planning to use large venues, such as gyms, in our city, but they have already been reserved for weekends throughout the year by many groups,” said an official with the Iwaki municipal government in Fukushima Prefecture. “If we ask them to change their schedules, it means they would have to cancel events they had planned.” There is also the difficulty in distributing the vaccine shots. The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine needs to be stored at around minus 75 degrees and used within five days after thawing. Municipalities in Kyoto Prefecture expressed worries about whether they can properly store the vaccine in gyms that they plan to turn into vaccination sites when outdoor temperatures start rising in March and April. The central government plans to distribute ultra-low temperature freezers for the vaccine to municipalities with populations of 35,000 or more by the end of February. But that will leave out many local governments, including places that would have no easy access to the shots. The cities of Iki and Tsushima, for example, are both located on remote islands in Nagasaki Prefecture. Prefectural officials are weighing what to do for them. The central government’s plan so far is to start vaccinating about 3.7 million health care workers in late February, followed by 36 million individuals aged 65 or older beginning in late March. However, Taro Kono, the minister in charge of the vaccination campaign, said on Jan. 27 that elderly people will receive shots in April or later. That could mean other groups, such as those with underlying conditions and workers at nursing care facilities, will get the vaccine later than the earlier announced start in April. Some local authorities are calling for flexibility. They say the COVID-19 vaccination schedule should be tailored to local needs, rather than run under a uniform nationwide guideline that prioritizes certain groups. “Let us take a flexible response based on the local situation,” Fukuoka Mayor Soichiro Takashima said at a news conference on Jan. 26.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14143160

The latest daily case figure for the capital rose above 1,000 from 973 the day before, but marked the lowest for any Thursday in January. Daily counts on Thursdays for Tokyo tend to be the highest because more tests are conducted at the beginning of the week and the results usually are returned around that day. Of the 1,064 new cases, 178 patients were in their 20s, followed by 173 in their 30s and 154 in their 40s. Serious cases on Jan. 28 were down nine from the previous day.

0,Suga says public assistance last resort to ease pain from virus,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"January 28, 2021 at 15:54 JST"," When Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga was asked what citizens being battered economically by the COVID-19 pandemic could expect in the way of government aid, his response astonished opposition lawmakers. “The government has as a last resort the framework known as public assistance,” Suga said at the Jan. 27 Upper House Budget Committee. Michihiro Ishibashi of the opposition Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan (CDP) asked Suga, “If it becomes clear that the government’s policies are not reaching those who need help, will you pledge as your responsibility as prime minister that you will ensure they get the assistance they need?” But Suga only touched upon the public assistance program already in place. He has long called for a policy that first asks citizens to be self-reliant. Those who cannot make do are expected to then tap their associates for aid, and the option of relying on public assistance has always been last on his list. The opposition parties had argued for more measures to help citizens facing financial difficulties due to the COVID-19 health crisis to be included in the third supplementary budget. Following the ruling coalition's rejection of the demands and Suga's public assistance remarks, opposition members were up in arms. CDP lawmaker Renho pounced on the prime minister in the afternoon session of the Upper House Budget Committee, addressing his morning comment on public assistance. “Isn't it your job to ensure that people don't have to turn to public assistance?” she asked Suga. Suga responded, “What is needed in dealing with the novel coronavirus pandemic is a multi-layered safety net. The government has a structure in place to deal with various problems before people have to turn to public assistance.” Ren Ohnishi, the managing director of the Moyai Support Center for Independent Living, provide testimony at the committee session as an expert on public assistance. Ohnishi urged that the current system be changed. He pointed to the problem of government officials inquiring into the possibility of relatives providing support whenever an individual applies for public assistance. The system as is exposes people who apply for aid to a potential backlash from their families, he pointed out. Suga did not respond directly to the possibility of reviewing the system and only said, “We are making efforts to help people recover a stable way of living.” After the session, Ohnishi said he hoped Suga’s comment about public assistance “becomes a message to people thinking about using public assistance that it is all right to do so.” But Ohnishi expressed regret that Suga did not touch upon reviewing the application process. “Because we now face an unprecedented crisis, I wanted him to utilize this opportunity to change a structure that causes people to hesitate about applying,” he said.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14143068
1,First COVID-19 vaccine drill held in Kawasaki to prepare workers,['By KENTA NOGUCHI/ Staff Writer'],"January 28, 2021 at 15:43 JST"," KAWASAKI--The first large-scale COVID-19 vaccination drill was held here to prep health workers and uncover potential problems for the much-anticipated and unprecedented mass inoculation program. About 60 people, including Kawasaki city government employees, participated in the Jan. 27 drill that was organized by the health ministry and the city in Kanagawa Prefecture. The participants simulated the vaccine operation flow while avoiding the risk of spreading the novel coronavirus. Local governments have know-how on distributing vaccines for influenza and other infectious diseases. But they are not necessarily well-equipped for the speedy and mass inoculation that is planned to end the COVID-19 crisis in Japan. “We want to use the knowledge obtained from the drill for those across the country,” Kawasaki Mayor Norihiko Fukuda said. “I understand that hopes for vaccines has been rising, but resources are limited. “I urge the central government not only to speed up the process but also to spread the correct information about the vaccine based on reality,” he added. The health ministry said it will share the lessons learned from the drill with local governments nationwide. The drill was held at a gymnasium at the Kawasaki City College of Nursing. Three booths were set up for diagnoses of and interviews with participants. Two additional booths were made available to administer the inoculations. In a waiting area, a safe distance separated the folding chairs. According to officials, the entire process, from being checked to receiving the vaccination, took between 10 and 30 minutes. Those who arrived later needed more time to complete the process, officials said. U.S. pharmaceutical company Pfizer Inc. has applied for Japanese health ministry approval of its vaccine, co-manufactured with German biocommerce company BioNTech. The Japanese government has signed a contract with Pfizer for about 144 million doses this year, enough to inoculate 72 million people.

1,AstraZeneca to make 90 million COVID-19 doses in Japan,['By EISUKE EGUCHI/ Staff Writer'],"January 28, 2021 at 14:00 JST"," British pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca Plc plans to produce up to 90 million doses of its COVID-19 vaccine in Japan and have them ready for distribution as early as this spring, according to sources. The drug company turned to local production to ensure a stable supply in Japan as countries around the globe are racing to secure enough doses for their citizens from limited supplies, the sources said. AstraZeneca signed a contract with the Japanese government to supply 120 million doses. The company plans to export 30 million doses to Japan by March, while the remaining 90 million doses will be produced in the country, according to the sources. JCR Pharmaceuticals Co., based in Hyogo Prefecture, will produce the content of the vaccine, while Tokyo-based Daiichi Sankyo Co. and KM Biologics Co., based in Kumamoto Prefecture, will be in charge of filling vials and other production procedures. The vaccine, developed by AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford, was approved for use in Britain in December, and inoculations started this month. In clinical trials, the vaccine was an average 70 percent effective in preventing the development of COVID-19, the company said. At the end of August last year, the pharmaceutical company started a clinical trial for the vaccine in Japan involving 256 participants. The company plans to soon apply to the health ministry for approval to manufacture and market the vaccine in Japan. The Japanese government also signed deals with U.S. pharmaceutical company Pfizer Inc. and U.S. biotech firm Moderna Inc. to receive doses of their vaccines. The Pfizer vaccine must be stored at about minus 70 degrees, while the Moderna vaccine requires refrigeration at around minus 20 degrees. The AstraZeneca vaccine is deemed more convenient for mass inoculations because its required storage temperature is 2 to 8 degrees, almost the same as a temperature inside regular refrigerators.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14143034

0,LDP moving to drop criminal penalties from COVID-19 bills,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"January 27, 2021 at 18:45 JST"," The ruling Liberal Democratic Party is moving to drop a planned legal revision that would impose prison terms against COVID-19 patients who refuse to be hospitalized, sources said. The LDP is eager to pass bills to revise the Infectious Disease Prevention Law and the special measures on dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic to prop up Japan’s defenses against the spread of the virus. However, opposition parties have denounced as too heavy the proposal to criminally punish infected individuals who reject hospitalization or leave a hospital against medical advice. Under the bill to amend the Infectious Disease Prevention Law, offenders could be imprisoned for up to a year or be slapped with a maximum fine of 1 million yen ($9,600). “We cannot accept a penalty that goes so far as imprisonment,” said Yukio Edano, leader of the main opposition Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan. The Cabinet approved the bills on Jan. 22, and the LDP is set to start Diet debate of the legislation on Jan. 29. But the proposed punitive measures have been a sticking point. The chief directors of the LDP and CDP of both the Lower House Health, Labor and Welfare Committee and the Cabinet Committee met for an hour on Jan. 26 to iron out their differences over the two revision bills. The CDP representatives demanded modifications to ease the criminal punishment measures, which they say amount to restrictions on private rights. Their LDP counterparts replied that they will weigh what they can do concerning their demand. The ruling party is considering arranging a meeting of the secretaries-general of the two parties on Jan. 27 if the two sides cannot find common ground. The LDP is leaning toward deleting the imprisonment provision to move along the process of passing the bills, the sources said. Another idea that has been floated within the ruling party is to reduce the maximum fine amount from 1 million yen to 500,000 yen, the sources added. The revision bill also includes criminal penalties for patients who refuse to cooperate with public health centers in their efforts to identify the source of the infections. Opposition to the imposition of criminal penalties is also strong outside the Diet. On Jan. 26, the Japan Academy of Public Health Nursing and the Japan Association of Public Health Nurse Educational Institutions each released a statement objecting to the penal provisions. The two organizations noted that trust between authorities and the public forms the basis of efforts to contain the novel coronavirus. They also called on the government to secure personnel to support and accurately grasp the condition of COVID-19 patients who are self-isolating at home and have no access to doctors. Katsuhiko Uchida, chief of the Japanese Association of Public Health Center Directors, said the association’s position is that the revision should not jeopardize assistance that public health centers have provided based on the philosophy of accommodating the needs of the public. He added that the association is not aware of any calls for criminal penalties against defiant patients from public health facilities. Public health centers ’ tasks include finding medical centers or accommodation facilities for people who test positive for the novel coronavirus. The revision bill for the special measures law would allow for penalties against businesses that reject prefectural authorities’ orders to close or shorten operating hours after authorities recognize the virus spread as threat to public health in their jurisdictions. These penalties would mainly be administrative fines, not criminal punishments, and could be imposed even if the area is not yet under a state of emergency. Key points of discussions between the LDP and CDP are: whether prefectural authorities can impose the penalties ahead of a state of emergency; the extent of the penalties; and emergency relief to businesses that comply with authorities’ instructions. Opposition parties are calling for a balance between the relief and punitive measures in the legislation.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14140382

The government has begged citizens to avoid going out to such spots to get the COVID-19 pandemic under control and urged businesses to close early. “I’m sorry about what happened while we are asking the public (to exercise self-restraint),” said Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga, commenting on the members’ behavior at an Upper House Budget Committee meeting on Jan. 27. “They should have acted in a way that can win the understanding of the public. We will handle the matter properly.” Bunshun Online reported on Jan. 26 that Kiyohiko Toyama, a former vice finance minister and a Lower House member of the junior ruling coalition partner, Komeito, went to a club in the Ginza district with an acquaintance on the evening of Jan. 22. “I deeply regret (what I did) from the bottom of my heart,” Toyama told reporters. The online news site Daily Shincho also reported on Jan. 26 that Jun Matsumoto, acting chairman of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party’s Diet Affairs Committee, visited clubs in Ginza and another establishment on the evening of Jan. 18. Matsumoto said he went to the clubs to hear requests from operators after they had closed for the day. “I regret my thoughtless behavior,” he said. “I’m truly sorry (for what I did).” The two members were not alone in defying restrictions imposed by the authorities to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus. Stablemaster Tokitsukaze went to a mah-jongg parlor during the New Year Grand Sumo Tournament, which ended on Jan. 24, in violation of the Japan Sumo Association’s guidelines to prevent infections, sources said on Jan. 27. The guidelines prohibit JSA members from going out unless absolutely necessary, in principle. The JSA will consider taking disciplinary action against him. Tokitsukaze, 47, a former makuuchi division wrestler known as Tokitsuumi, also visited Miyagi Prefecture on a private trip and participated in a golf competition last autumn despite the ban on nonessential outings. In response to his actions, the JSA demoted his council member status to the lowest rank “toshiyori” after the Autumn Grand Sumo Tournament.

0,Opposition fails in bid to use Go To Travel funds to fight virus,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"January 27, 2021 at 17:28 JST"," The third supplementary budget passed the Lower House on Jan. 26 despite howls of protest from the opposition that it sacrifices support for health care workers battling the pandemic in favor of propping up the economy. The opposition parties argued for taking the 1.031 trillion yen ($9.94 billion) set aside for the controversial Go To Travel tourism campaign and using it to support health care professionals and medical institutions, dealing with the high number of COVID-19 cases. The Go To Travel campaign, created to help the tourist industry weather economic hardship from the pandemic, was suspended in December following a spike in COVID-19 cases nationwide. The opposition parties presented motions in the Lower House Budget Committee to delete provisions in the supplementary budget proposal that set aside funds for the tourism promotion campaign. But the ruling coalition voted down the motions and approved the budget without change. The opposition parties also asked for a continuation of the government outlays to businesses negatively affected by the novel coronavirus crisis to subsidize lost sales income and pay rents. But Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga said bars and restaurants were the main focus of the measures now in place so the only outlays would be the money paid to those establishments that are cooperating with requests from prefectural governors to shorten their business hours. The third supplementary budget totals 19.176 trillion yen. Of that, 4.358 trillion yen has been allocated for pandemic measures such as support for medical institutions and setting up a vaccination program. But more than double that--11.677 trillion yen--has been set aside for economic measures once the pandemic is brought under control. Money has also been reserved for the Go To Eat program to support eateries and put into a foundation to support development of innovative technology to move toward a society of net zero greenhouse gas emissions. The opposition parties argued that such measures do nothing to address the crisis Japan now faces of surging COVID-19 cases. The Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan and the Japanese Communist Party jointly entered a motion to delete about 6 trillion yen from the supplementary budget and use the funds to combat the novel coronavirus pandemic. In addition to support for medical institutions, the opposition parties wanted more measures to help those facing economic difficulties due to the pandemic. But the ruling coalition rejected those motions, including one that would have revived a program similar to the cash payments of 100,000 yen given to all residents of Japan last spring. As Suga has long been an advocate of the Go To Travel campaign, it is not surprising that the administration refused to buckle under the opposition's sharp criticism. Meanwhile, only about half of the money set aside in past supplementary budgets to pay for the campaign has been spent, according to the Japan Tourism Agency. On top of that, with no indication of when the Go To Travel campaign will resume, some agency officials are raising doubts as to whether all the funds set aside from the first supplementary budget will be used by the end of the current fiscal year in March. The Upper House deliberated the supplementary budget on Jan. 27 and is expected to approve it on Jan. 28.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14140165
1,Tokyo seems on delicate path to recovery in state of emergency,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"January 27, 2021 at 16:05 JST"," Novel coronavirus-related numbers point to improved conditions in Tokyo nearly three weeks since the state of emergency was declared, but health experts warn that irresponsible behavior could quickly reverse the positive trend. The state of emergency was announced for Tokyo and three surrounding prefectures on Jan. 7, when the daily count of new COVID-19 cases often exceeded 2,000 in the capital. The number of newly confirmed infections on Jan. 25 was 618, the first time since Dec. 28 for the daily count to fall below 700. However, a day-to-day comparison of new infections does not provide an accurate picture of trends because the tally depends on the number of tests given and the time needed for confirmation. Mondays, for example, usually have a lower count because public health centers and testing facilities are closed on weekends. Jan. 25 was a Monday, and the following day, the number of newly confirmed COVID-19 cases in Tokyo shot up to 1,026. A week-on-week comparison provides a clearer picture, and it shows a downward trend in new infections in the capital. On Friday, Jan. 15, the number of new cases in Tokyo was 2,001. It was 1,175 a week later on Jan. 22. On Saturday, Jan. 16, the figure was 1,809, and it fell to 1,070 on Jan. 23. The Tokyo tally also dropped from 1,592 on Sunday, Jan. 17, to 986 on Jan. 24. For the two Mondays over the period, the infection figure nearly halved from 1,204 to 618. On Tuesday, Jan. 19, the number was 1,240. It was 1,026 a week later on Jan. 26. The daily average of new COVID-19 cases for the week to Jan. 19 was 1,540.1 in Tokyo. But it was 1,088.6 for the week until Jan. 26, down by about 450. The ratio of positive results from testing for the virus has also dropped in Tokyo. The percentage is used to determine the extent of community-acquired infections. In early November, the weekly average of positive tests in Tokyo was less than 4 percent, but the ratio gradually rose to 10 percent on Dec. 30. On Jan. 7, the positive test ratio reached a peak of 14.5 percent. But since the state of emergency was declared, the rate has declined. On Jan. 24, it was 9 percent. The percentage of positive tests is one of six barometers used by the central government’s panel of health experts to determine the infection situation and the burden on the health care system of an area. The most severe level for the barometers is 4, which signals an explosive increase in novel coronavirus infections. The central government has said these barometers need to reach level 3, indicating a rapid increase in infections, for a lifting of the state of emergency. An average 10-percent positive test rate for a week falls into both level 3 and 4 of the barometer, according to the central government. Currently, the positive rate in Tokyo appears to be at level 2, meaning that infections are gradually increasing. The infection-related numbers have dropped despite the lackadaisical approach taken by many residents in Tokyo. According to Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Medical Science, crowd sizes in nightlife districts of Tokyo during the week until Jan. 16 were about twice as large as the smallest turnouts recorded in spring 2020, when the first state of emergency was issued nationwide. The institute analyzed population data collected through a global positioning system at seven locations in Tokyo from 8 p.m. until midnight. These locations were in Ikebukuro, Shinjuku, Shibuya, Ueno, Ginza and Roppongi. In the week until Jan. 16, the turnout in those areas from 8 p.m. to 10 p.m. was 2.1 times more than the figure for last spring. From 10 p.m. to midnight, the crowds were 1.9 times larger than the turnout last spring.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14140129

Of a total 1,167 officers and workers who have tested positive for COVID-19 since March, 477, or about 40 percent of the cases were reported since the start of 2021 alone, according to figures provided by the agency. Mitsuhiro Matsumoto, commissioner general of the agency, said police cannot avoid the risk of contracting the virus because their duties require frequent contact with the public and that they work closely with their colleagues as a team. “We will enforce anti-coronavirus measures thoroughly so that police activities to maintain public order will not be disrupted,” he said at a news conference on Jan. 21. Matsumoto said the agency is allowing officers and other employees to work in a flexible manner and is advising them to closely monitor their health in the face of rising cases among its ranks.

0,Study: Men more at risk of COVID-19 death due to immune systems,['By KAI ICHINO/ Staff Writer'],"January 25, 2021 at 07:00 JST"," Men are more likely to die from COVID-19 than women due to the differences in reactions in their immune systems associated with age, according to scientists. The gender gap has been confirmed not only in Japan but also other parts of the world, although an expert noted it is too early to jump to conclusions. Data from the health ministry show 1,898 men passed away by Dec. 28 in Japan after being infected with the novel coronavirus, while 1,214 women died in the same period. The mortality rate was 1.6 percent for men, compared with 1.2 percent for women. A team of scientists from Britain and elsewhere in December last year analyzed 3.11 million cases reported between January and June, and discovered that male patients are 1.39 times more likely to die of the disease. The gender difference in the fatality ratio has been confirmed in other infectious disorders in the past as well. A survey of about 1,800 patients suffering from severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Hong Kong showed that men were at 1.66 times the risk of passing away. The death rate for Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) was 52 percent for men, far higher than the 23 percent for women, according to a study of about 430 cases in Saudi Arabia. Immune systems respond to infection differently in male and female patients, and this is cited as a cause of men’s tendency to develop more serious conditions. Under immune mechanisms, natural immunity, or a defense function one has since birth, works first, and then acquired immunity exerts its stronger capability. A protein known as cytokine is produced by immune cells. If the substance is excessively generated in the natural immunity process, healthy cells are attacked in a phenomenon called the cytokine storm, which is blamed for worsening conditions in COVID-19. In August last year, a team including Akiko Iwasaki, a professor of medicine, and associate research scientist Takehiro Takahashi at Yale University, examined the amount of cytokine and the ability of immune cells in 98 infected men and women. According to their findings published in a paper, a larger volume of cytokine was found in infected male patients than females, while acquired immunity worked more actively in women. Especially in elderly men, extreme reactions of natural immunity were identified while acquired immunity was apt to respond insufficiently. Takahashi said natural immunity generally functions strongly and acquired immunity weakly both in elderly men and women. “Effects of age on the immune system appear more clearly in men, likely leading to the severe progress of the condition in elderly men,” Takahashi said. How immune mechanisms respond is said to be affected by genes and sex hormones. Women have two X chromosomes, which determine the individual’s gender and features many immunity-related genes, but men only have one. Kazunori Oishi, director of the Toyama Institute of Health, who once served as head of the National Institute of Infectious Diseases’ Infectious Disease Surveillance Center, said men are likely to have more serious conditions due to COVID-19 but described the cause as being “complicated and difficult to determine.” “What is important is not identifying the cause but considering treatment strategies with the gender difference in mind,” said Oishi.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14102869

1,Olympians fear Tokyo Games could spread virus,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"January 24, 2021 at 15:50 JST"," Japanese athletes expecting to participate in the delayed 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games fear the sports extravaganza could end up exacerbating the novel coronavirus pandemic, posing an added risk to themselves as well as fans, an Asahi Shimbun poll shows. They also expressed concern about a lack of support from fans at a time when the public is more preoccupied with staying safe than attending a massive event. The survey was carried out as the nation grapples with a sharp surge in infections that has pushed the nationwide death toll from COVID-19 to over 5,000 this week. The primary concern, voiced by 25 respondents, was that the summer Games could result in spreading the virus further. This was followed by 18 worried about the risk of contracting the virus themselves. A lack of strong support from the public after the pandemic struck accounted for 15 replies. Fourteen Olympians cited a lack of competitions and inadequate training opportunities to prepare for the Games. The same number worried that the Games, if they go ahead, would fall short of becoming an event where athletes are able to compete to become the world’s No. 1 due to an absence of numerous competitors. Six respondents said they are not particularly concerned about the Games, according to the survey. Respondents were allowed to choose more than one answer with regard to the question that concerns them most about the Games. The online survey was conducted between November and January, covering 126 Olympians of 15 events, and on condition their names would be withheld when The Asahi Shimbun reported the findings. Forty-one athletes expecting to participate in 11 events provided replies before Jan. 7, when the government declared a second state of emergency for the greater Tokyo area due to the spiraling pandemic. The government maintains that the Olympics and Paralympics can go ahead this summer as rescheduled as long as due precautions are taken against infections. In contrast, an overwhelming majority of the public are concerned about the wisdom of holding the event in light of a steep rise in cases and deaths in recent months, opinion polls by news media show. The Asahi Shimbun survey found that many Olympians felt the government had failed to provide a sufficient explanation about its preparations toward hosting the Games. This was the most common answer chosen by 19, when respondents were asked about what they felt was lacking most. Asked to choose multiple answers about what they felt is indispensable for the Games to be held a year behind schedule, 22 cited spectators. The same number cited attendance of athletes from all member countries and territories of the International Olympic Committee. Both figures constituted the most common answer. Sixteen Olympians referred to the Opening and Closing ceremonies of the Games. Six chose the Olympic Village for athletes while three, the least, mentioned the Olympic torch relay leading up to the Games. The IOC said in March 2020, when it announced the postponement of the Tokyo Games, that only 57 percent of all events were filled, noting that the rest remained up in the air due to the global pandemic. As for a cap on the number of spectators, 13 respondents picked the answer that half the capacity or only those who are relatives of or associated with Olympians should be allowed to attend. Eleven chose the option of not imposing a ceiling on spectator numbers. Asked to write freely about their situation while the public health crisis rages, one respondent said restrictions on training made it an exacting task to get a sense of getting in better physical shape and maintaining motivation. Another athlete cited the difficulty of securing funds for training as sponsor companies found their bottom lines heavily impacted by the pandemic. But some Olympians tried to find a positive side to the rescheduled Games. One said the year-long delay provided valuable time to address a weak point during the extended training period. Another said the rescheduling provided renewed inspiration to do one's utmost under such a tough environment.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14132525

0,18 COVID-19 patients die while self-isolating in their homes,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"January 23, 2021 at 18:33 JST"," At least 18 deaths of patients confirmed with COVID-19 occurred while they were self-isolating at home, some of whom had been banking on the availability of a hospital bed for treatment. Figures show that about 35,000 people with the novel coronavirus are currently trying to recuperate at home, prompting health experts to predict the number of fatalities could rise. The Asahi Shimbun contacted officials of the 11 prefectures now under the second state of emergency regarding the novel coronavirus pandemic and found that of the 18 people who died, 15 did so after December. Seven of the fatalities occurred in Tokyo. Some cases offered stark confirmation that the health of those confirmed COVID-19 can take a sudden turn for the worse. One man in his 80s suffering from diabetes did not display any symptoms of COVID-19, but tested positive on Jan. 15. He died two days later. All seven fatalities in the capital occurred this month, said a Tokyo metropolitan government official, noting that they all involved a sudden deterioration in the patient’s condition. Among the other prefectures under the state of emergency, Saitama reported that three residents died while self-isolating at home. There were two deaths each in Chiba, Tochigi and Kyoto prefectures and one each in Kanagawa and Osaka prefectures. Of the 18, six died while seeking a bed to free up at a hospital capable of treating COVID-19 patients. An Osaka resident in his 50s who was resting at home because he only had minor symptoms died while an ambulance was taking him to a hospital. Hiroshima and Gunma prefectures, which are not covered by the state of emergency, also reported fatalities among residents self-isolating at home. The surge in new COVID-19 cases since January has led to a dramatic increase in demand for hospital beds. In Tokyo as of Jan. 20, there were 6,799 residents awaiting an opening at a hospital or an accommodation facility for those with minor symptoms. The figure represented a six-fold increase over that of four weeks previously. “It is extremely dangerous to have a situation where the safety of those resting at home has not been secured,” said Satoshi Kutsuna, a doctor at the National Center for Global Health and Medicine. “There is the fear that more people will die. The only way to avoid having those waiting for a hospital bed rest at home is to reduce the number of new cases.” Kutsuna also offered some tips for family members of patients resting at home about what to look for if symptoms take a sudden turn for worse. He noted that the health of patients can abruptly deteriorate about a week after symptoms emerge. “Family members should contact their local public health office if the patient has trouble breathing even after slight movement,” Kutsuna said. He also suggested using a pulse oximeter that local governments are lending out to check for a sudden lowering of blood oxygen levels.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14130936

The pace of COVID-19-related deaths has picked up considerably in recent months. On July 20, fatalities reached the 1,000 level. It took only four more months for the figure to double. Prior to this grim announcement, a nationwide record of 108 new pandemic-related deaths for one day was confirmed on Jan. 22. The health ministry announced Jan. 22 that a Tokyo girl under the age of 10 was confirmed to be infected with the variant strain found in Britain. However, there is no record of her ever being in Britain, nor did she have any contact with anyone who had visited that nation, ministry officials said. While the girl does not display any obvious symptoms, she has been hospitalized.

0,Isolation due to COVID-19 a key factor in suicide surge in 2020,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"January 23, 2021 at 18:04 JST"," Groups manning hotlines dedicated to talking people out of committing suicide found their phones ringing off the hook in 2020. So, it came as no surprise to them that a Jan. 22 report on suicides across Japan last year registered the first increase in 11 years. The primary culprit for the surge, particularly noticeable among women, was emotional and financial stress caused by isolation as the nation fought to contain the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. Lifelink, a nonprofit organization working to prevent suicides, operates social media accounts that allow anyone to post messages about their problems. It reported about 3,000 consultations in March, but in September, after the second wave of the pandemic hit, the figure rose to 15,000. About 70 percent of those sending messages were women. Figures for suicides nationwide in 2020 showed a 14.5 percent increase among women. “I am being physically abused by my husband. Nothing changes even if I put up resistance. The only alternative is to die,” read one message received by Lifelink. Health ministry officials analyzing the causes of suicides for the period between last January and November, noted there was a 58.2 percent increase in suicides among women in their 20s and 30s due to economic and lifestyle problems. Requests from local governments to refrain from going out were likely another factor as there were 390 cases in which the suicide was linked to feelings of isolation arising from a lack of opportunities to meet up with coworkers, friends and family members. “Many suicides are triggered by a chain reaction among a number of different factors,” noted Yasuyuki Shimizu, who heads Lifelink. Women and young people are deemed to be particularly vulnerable if they lose their main source of income or face domestic violence, he said, adding that  media reports about suicides of celebrities were likely a contributing factor. Shimizu called on local governments to more actively provide information about support measures available to women and young people who may not be aware of such programs. The record number of suicides among elementary, junior high and senior high school students was also closely tied with the COVID-19 crisis. Childline Support Center Japan, which operates telephone consultation services for young people, noted a sharp decrease in calls about bullying, but an increase in young people feeling depressed or facing problems at home because parents were working remotely. Between March and October, the group received a 4.6-fold increase in calls from young people hinting they wanted to end their lives. Junko Kobayashi, who heads the group, called on adults to pay more attention to their children and listen to what they have to say. She noted that the pandemic had sharply reduced opportunities for young people to go out, depriving them of a meaningful outlet to have contact with others of the same age. Lifelink’s Shimizu urged the government to provide more consultation services for those in distress because the private-sector support groups were now operating at capacity.

0,"Officials doubt naming, shaming eateries a viable punishment",['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"January 21, 2021 at 19:16 JST"," Twenty metropolitan government employees fanned out in search of open bars and restaurants in Tokyo’s major nightlife districts on the nights of Jan. 18 and 19. But they were not looking for a night on the town. They were on the hunt for businesses going against the government’s request to close their doors early, issued in a bid to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus. The punishment for remaining open late is being publicly named as a noncompliant business. The 20 officials managed to visually inspect 2,027 restaurants and bars in Shinjuku, Shibuya, Ikebukuro, Shinbashi, Kichijoji and Tachikawa districts. Ultimately, they decided that 1,927, or 95 percent, had followed the government’s request to close by 8 p.m. But with tens of thousands of eateries in the capital, some Tokyo officials have expressed doubts that the government can determine the noncompliant businesses and disclose their names fairly. The central government recently revised a special law dealing with the pandemic so local governments under a state of emergency can now make the names of noncooperative restaurants and bars public. Lawmakers are discussing the possibility of introducing punitive provisions in the special law. But in the meantime, with about 87,000 restaurants and bars in Tokyo, including major chains, at least a few metropolitan government officials are raising their eyebrows over the difficulties of the task of fairly naming all the violators. The visual site inspections expected will amount to a major undertaking for local officials. “Realistically, it is extremely difficult to go inspect every restaurant and bar,” a metropolitan government official said. “But without doing it, we cannot maintain a level playing field. “Some businesses may be closed when we visit there, but they may secretly remain open (after 8 p.m.) several days later,” the official added. “We may end up just saying that we will name names and rely on deterrence.” Another metropolitan government official said the naming-and-shaming measure is, in fact, intended to deter residents from going to noncompliant businesses. The official said naming noncooperative businesses “will have an impact on the public, who will think that the business is not cooperative.” The viability of the government’s request “will certainly improve a lot” through that kind of punishment, the official said. The current special law allows local governors to request and instruct businesses, event organizers, facility operators and others to limit their hours of operation and cancel events. When they do not comply, governors can then name names. When the central government issued the nationwide state of emergency in April, pachinko parlors and internet cafes that did not suspend operations were the main target of this form of punishment. Restaurants and bars were not included in the list. According to data compiled by the Cabinet Secretariat after the state of emergency was lifted, 21 local governments, including Tokyo, issued those kinds of requests to businesses. Five prefectures--Chiba, Kanagawa, Niigata, Hyogo and Fukuoka--issued instructions. Since revealing the names of certain businesses could lead to limiting private rights, governments have to take a gradual approach to dealing with uncooperative businesses. According to the notice issued by the Cabinet Secretariat in April 2020, a local government is first required to ask the business to cooperate without publicly naming them. If the business still refuses to comply, the government is once again required to ask the business to follow the request and warn that it would be publicly singled out for flouting it. The notice asks local governments to “investigate thoroughly” into whether other businesses nearby are also not complying, so that the punishment is not selective or unfair to certain businesses and facilities. “It is necessary to ensure a legitimacy of the process,” a Cabinet Secretariat official said. The notice also asks local governments to listen to experts’ opinions to make sure the risk of an infection cluster is high before proceeding with public shaming. Under the current state of emergency, the types of businesses local governments can reveal the names of have widened to include restaurants and bars, meaning local officials have a whole lot more ground to cover. Tokyo officials decided to only publicize the names of pachinko parlors last spring when the capital was under the state of emergency. Out of a total 770 pachinko parlors in Tokyo, about 70 were publicly identified for remaining open.

0,"40,000 foreign trainees enter Japan amid virus as others fired",['By MARI FUJISAKI/ Staff Writer'],"January 21, 2021 at 18:49 JST"," Two Vietnamese trainees in their 20s, fired by a Shikoku supermarket at the end of last year as a result of the pandemic economy, came all the way to Tokyo to get help from a support group to find new work. The Japan-Vietnam Coexistence Support Group, which assisted the two fired workers, is trying to place unemployed Vietnamese trainees at dozens of companies across Japan that are known to be trustworthy employers. Jiho Yoshimizu, a nun who runs the Tokyo support group, said her group has received thousands of cases seeking help to date. Nearly 100 landed new jobs through the group’s assistance. Japan has accepted tens of thousands of new foreign technical intern trainees since last summer even though many, like the two Vietnamese trainees who arrived earlier, lost their jobs and have no clue when they can go home amid the COVID-19 pandemic. The government has extended assistance to jobless trainees since last year, but advocates for foreign workers call for a sweeping overhaul of the technical intern training program, saying the relief step is not sufficient. The environment surrounding foreign interns is becoming increasingly harsh since the pandemic struck. About 3,000 trainees were unemployed as of the end of November after their employers went bankrupt or made them redundant, according to the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare. Of these, about 100 could not land new jobs as of this month. Justice Ministry data painted a grim picture of their situation. As of late last year, about 36,000 trainees were unable to return home due to their country’s travel restrictions even after their training period in Japan was over. About 1,000 of the trainees stuck in Japan had no jobs. Foreign technical intern trainees, who come from developing countries to learn professional skills in Japan, are supposed to work only in a job and at a workplace that were already set before their arrival. But the Justice Ministry relaxed the rules in April to help trainees ride out the pandemic since it has caused them to lose their jobs or become unable to return home. Trainees are now allowed to take another job for up to a year if it is in 14 specified industries, such as nursing, agriculture and construction, areas where foreigners can work on a newly created visa status known as specified skilled workers. As of Jan. 12, the rescue program had helped 1,716 interns find employment. But 1,100 are still without work. Despite this, Japan took in 40,000 new trainees between August and Jan. 3, most arriving after November when Japan lifted a global ban on new entrants. A possible reason that demand persists for foreign trainees is that supervising organizations that accept them can get commissions to assign trainees to member companies, said Ippei Torii, a representative of nonprofit Solidarity Network with Migrants Japan. Supervising organizations include business groups and chambers of commerce and industry. “That indicates that there is great demand for trainees out there,” Torii said. “But little assistance has been available in finding them a new job after they were dismissed. They are sort of disposable labor.” He underlined the need for the government to intensify efforts to rescue them. Toshihiro Menju, managing director of the Japan Center for International Exchange, a nonprofit foreign affairs institute, who is familiar with immigration policy, said a key reason trainees face enormous difficulty in finding new jobs is that no entity was designated to be primarily responsible for the task. While trainees could try to find work on their own at public unemployment offices, the reality is that many have a limited command of Japanese and the existing system is not tailored to their needs. Shoichi Ibusuki, a lawyer who has handled numerous labor issues involving foreign workers, said issues involving foreign trainees are basically left to supervising organizations to sort out. But he said such organizations do not have a strong incentive to go to great lengths to find new positions for trainees upon their dismissal. The reason is that those organizations will become ineligible to receive supervising fees from the employers if trainees land a job in the 14 industries where specified skilled workers are employed and their visa status is changed accordingly. Yoshimizu proposed the creation of a new mechanism in which an entity will be commissioned to specialize in job placement for foreign trainees. Japan’s technical intern training program has long been criticized as a cover for using foreign workers as cheap labor under the name of ""job training."" Menju said it is time for Japan to overhaul the system partly to prepare for an intensifying global competition to attract foreign workers in the years ahead. “How the country will reform the system will determine whether Japan can become a country those workers choose,” he said. “Japan should compile a vision also to secure foreign personnel for a post-pandemic era.”",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14125024

1,Many moving from Tokyo amid pandemic but not to outlying areas,['By MIKIHARU SUGIURA/ Staff Writer'],"January 21, 2021 at 07:00 JST"," Business management consultant Takuto Nagata once had no choice but to live in Tokyo, as he worked in the offices of his client corporations. But now, working remotely has given Nagata, 33, the chance to move from central Tokyo to outside the capital. “ Teleworking has become a common work style, eliminating the need to live in the central part of the capital where rents are expensive,” said Nagata. Prompted by the spreading telework practice and expensive housing rents, Nagata is not alone in escaping from Tokyo. The capital’s population was down by nearly 37,000 by Dec. 1 from July, marking the fifth monthly decline in a row. According to Tokyo officials, it was the first time since 2012 that more people have left the capital than flowed into it. The rare situation is said to have arisen from the novel coronavirus pandemic. Nagata decided it was time to make the move in May, when many people began working from home. He relocated from Tokyo's Koto Ward to Kamakura in neighboring Kanagawa Prefecture in July because his grandmother used to live there. His monthly housing rent dropped 20 percent and the space in his residence increased by 1.5 times. Nagata now enjoys windsurfing after his daily run on his days off. As Nagata still needs to go to central Tokyo once or twice a week, he does not intend to move out of the Tokyo metropolitan area. HALF STAY IN METROPOLITAN AREA The demographic trend, however, is not expected to help address the issue of the population influx into urban zones such as Tokyo. Hiroo Ichikawa, a professor emeritus of urban policies at Meiji University who is knowledgeable about demographic dynamics, said Nagata is a “typical example” of those relocating from Tokyo. “ Although more people actually leave the capital than new residents moving in, more than half of them relocate to Kanagawa, Chiba and Saitama prefectures within the Tokyo metropolitan area,” Ichikawa said. “The total population of the metropolitan area is rather on the increase. It still cannot be said that people have started heading to local regions.” HIGH RENTS Yoichi Ikemoto, the chief editor of the residential information website Suumo, pointed out that residents flee from Tokyo because of “the extremely expensive rents and prices of homes and real estate at the center of the capital.” “ The tendency of flowing out to suburban zones, which began a few years ago, has simply accelerated,” he said. Whereas the average wage has not risen dramatically, apartment prices continue rising, particularly in central Tokyo. As developers of hotels and office buildings buy up land and pay increasing costs for workers and materials, building costs have increased 10 percent over the last five years. Meanwhile, home prices have not experienced a drastic rise. Ikemoto called it “only natural” that people move to areas at a distance from the center of the capital. “ The number of noise-related problems surged two- to fivefold from normal years, when children could not go out while the country was under a state of emergency (in 2020),” he said. “Demand is growing further for larger spaces and more rooms.” In fact, according to Ikemoto, more than one agent has reported record-high sales for homes in suburban areas. A representative of Mitsui Fudosan Realty Co., Japan’s largest real estate agent, acknowledged the increased interest among home buyers. “ We currently receive 20 to 30 percent more inquiries from those wanting to buy residences, compared with the same period of the previous year,” said the representative. “But few of them are hoping to relocate to very distant regions. Those who initially were considering buying homes several years in the future have apparently moved up their schedules.” CIRCUMSTANCES SAME FOR BUSINESSES An official of CBRE KK, a leading real estate service provider for corporations, said the company “at first tried hard to win over customers in the expectation that more businesses will relocate from Tokyo to local regions.” “ But there was little demand for that,” the official said. Few clients want to relocate their headquarters though many have reduced the number of floors they occupy. Even if considering relocating, they ask CBRE to look for satellite offices in suburban areas. The trend is the same as that for homes. Uncertainty lingers over future prospects. “ The ratio of teleworkers is lower in areas outside the Tokyo metropolitan area,” said Ikemoto. “This clearly shows the difference in businesses’ ability to respond to changing situations, meaning Tokyo is still a highly attractive location.” On the other hand, the CBRE representative noted that desirability “may change.” The biggest reason for Tokyo’s dense population is that a large number of people come to the capital to attend college and find employment. The real test for reform is whether popular colleges and corporations will turn to local regions to relocate there.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14088151
0,"In virus surge, more hospitals turning away ambulances",['By RYO YAMAGISHI/ Staff Writer'],"January 20, 2021 at 18:46 JST"," The spread of the novel coronavirus has led to a doubling of the number of times ambulance workers have found difficulties in finding hospitals willing to take in their patients, government figures showed. In 3,317 cases nationwide in the week up to Jan. 17, rescue workers were denied access to hospitals at least three times and were forced to wait at least 30 minutes before driving to hospitals that accepted the patients, according to data compiled by the Fire and Disaster Management Agency. Some rescue workers said that the mere mention that the patient has a fever led to hospital officials denying access. Many of the hospitals that have been called may not have the equipment or personnel to care for COVID-19 patients in addition to the individual’s particular condition. According to the FDMA, the latest weekly figure was 2.35 times that for the week up until Dec. 6 when there were 1,410 cases of difficulty in finding a hospital. The pace at which difficult cases are increasing has accelerated. The weeks from mid-December until Jan. 3 saw increases of between 100 and 200 cases from the previous week. But in the week ending Jan. 10, the increase was 528. The number of cases jumped by 610 in the following week. That trend coincides with the spike in new COVID-19 cases. “With the increasing number of new infections, we have received a greater number of reports regarding difficulty finding a hospital for those who called for an ambulance,” Ryota Takeda, the internal affairs minister who oversees the FDMA, said at his Jan. 15 news conference. “There will be a need to continue monitoring this trend.” The Tokyo Fire Department reported 1,577 difficult cases in the week ending Jan. 17, 2.5 times the figure for the week ending Dec. 6. The fire department does not handle cases on the outlying islands or in Inagi, a city in the western suburbs. Other major cities now under the state of emergency for the novel coronavirus pandemic have also seen sharp rises in difficult cases between the week ending Dec. 6 and the week ending Jan. 17. The increases were: 3.26-fold in Yokohama; 2.36-fold in Chiba city; 3.45-fold in Saitama city; 1.56-fold in Osaka; 3.38-fold in Nagoya; and 3.14-fold in Fukuoka. During the first wave of COVID-19 infections in spring 2020, the largest number of difficult cases over a one-week period was 1,780. But that record was broken in the week ending Dec. 27, with 1,920 cases. Since then, the record has been reset every week.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14121939
0,High hurdles await Japan’s unprecedented vaccine program,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"January 20, 2021 at 18:05 JST"," Japan is banking on a vaccine as a game-changer in the COVID-19 pandemic, but it first must overcome a potential logistical nightmare, possible bureaucratic turf wars and labor shortages to inoculate the population. The country has yet to approve a vaccine, but complaints against the Yoshihide Suga administration concerning the vaccination program have already started. “It is a project the likes of which we have never seen before,” a government official said. The success of the program could hinge on the coordination abilities of Taro Kono, the administrative reform minister. Suga on Jan. 18 appointed Kono to a special Cabinet post to oversee the entire process of vaccinating the population. Suga has repeatedly said the government plans to begin inoculations by the end of February. Countries in Europe and North America have already started their vaccination procedures. U.S. pharmaceutical company Pfizer Inc. has applied for Japanese approval of a vaccine that it co-manufactured with German biocommerce company BioNTech. Under Japan’s expected schedule, Pfizer will submit additional data from clinical trials by the end of January, and the health ministry will approve the vaccine by the end of February after its safety and effectiveness are confirmed. The government plans to immediately start vaccinating about 10,000 health care workers who give their consent and are affiliated with selected hospitals and groups, such as the National Hospital Organization. The group will then be required to report their health conditions for a certain period so that government officials can check for possible side effects from the vaccine. The second group to receive the vaccine will also consist of health care workers. After March, the rollout will start covering people 65 years old and older, those with pre-existing conditions and then workers at facilities for elderly people. The government has not determined when the general public can receive the shots, but some sources said it will be around June. The government is expected to make the vaccine available only to those who are 16 and older because data from clinical testing conducted by Pfizer and BioNTech are insufficient for those under 16. Local governments will take charge of the inoculations. Even if the plan goes as scheduled, it will take at least several months for the necessary doses to go around the country. But many things could go wrong. Pfizer’s vaccine must be stored at around minus 70 degrees, including during transportation. The ministry plans to ask local governments to set up special freezers to keep Pfizer’s vaccine at 10,000 health care facilities. To provide wide distribution of the vaccine among residents, the vaccines will be transported while being refrigerated to local clinics and hospitals. Local governments will receive the vaccine in sets of 1,000. After thawing, the vaccine’s storage life is five days. To avoid wasting doses, local governments are expected to hold mass inoculation events where a large number of people can be vaccinated in one setting. However, in many areas, particularly densely populated urban centers, officials are racking their brains over how to hold such events safely amid the pandemic’s “third wave.” In addition, many communities and health care facilities have already faced labor shortages on the front lines of the pandemic. The months-long vaccination project will undoubtedly further strain conditions. Local government officials have expressed concerns that they could lack sufficient numbers of doctors and nurses to carry out the vaccination operation. Fukushima Governor Masao Uchibori on Jan. 19 criticized the central government for remaining vague about what local governments should do to prepare for the vaccination program. “We have asked the related ministries and agencies to tell us about the necessary arrangements and staff sizes, among other things, as soon as possible, but we still remain uncertain about all of these things,” Uchibori said. Local officials will also have to handle the large number of applications and inquiries from residents at inoculation sites and other places. The central government estimates that about 50 million people are in the high-priority groups for the COVID-19 vaccine, namely health care workers and elderly people. The vaccine is not mandatory and will be offered for free of charge to all residents. Lawmakers and others have pointed out that turf-minded bureaucrats could hinder the smooth rollout of the vaccine, given the many ministries involved in the process. The health ministry would be in charge of inoculations, the transportation ministry will take care of distribution, the economy ministry will handle the cryopreservation, and the internal affairs ministry will make arrangements with local governments. Kono is expected to eliminate vertically divided administrative functions and deliver a well-coordinated and speedy vaccine distribution. Kono and Takuya Hirai, minister of digital transformation, on Jan. 19 discussed the idea of using the My Number identification system to manage the vaccination history. Ken Ishii, a professor at the Institute of Medical Science at the University of Tokyo, said the government “does not have much lead time, and the scale of the vaccination will be unprecedented.” “For local governments, it will be more like a disaster response,” Ishii said. He advises government officials to learn from problems reported overseas concerning the vaccination programs and make plans to deal with such issues.

The man, 49, locked himself in a restroom stall for roughly four hours at the exam venue after refusing to leave, before police climbed over the top of it and apprehended him, according to the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department. The man was taking the unified university entrance examinations on Jan. 16. He is suspected of having locked himself in a stall at the Etchujima campus of the Tokyo University of Marine Science and Technology in Tokyo’s Koto Ward from around 6 p.m. to 10 p.m. that day, according to the Fukagawa Police Station. Police released him from custody on Jan. 19. During the exam, the man six times disobeyed test proctors' instructions to cover his nose and refused to take the test in another room, according to the education ministry. Even after he was disqualified from the exam for his misconduct, he refused to leave the venue. Thirty-one examinees at the venue were forced to move to another room due to the disturbance. The start of the English listening test was also delayed five minutes by the incident. Education minister Koichi Hagiuda, catching wind of the face mask incident, said test proctors were correct in disqualifying the man for not covering his nose. “The government has been spreading awareness that the proper way to wear a mask is to cover both your mouth and nose,” he said during a news conference on Jan. 19 following a Cabinet meeting.

Shizuoka Prefecture the same day issued an emergency alert over a surge in infections, asking residents to refrain from chatting during meals and traveling across prefectural borders. At an emergency news conference on Jan. 19, Shizuoka Governor Heita Kawakatsu indicated that the patients contracted the strain while dining out with travelers from other prefectures where infections are spiking. “If the variant is as transmissible as the one hitting Britain, the number of new infections will surge, putting the health care system at risk (of collapsing),” Kawakatsu warned. In Japan, about 40 cases of the more contagious coronavirus variant have been detected so far among arrivals from overseas at airport quarantine checks and people who had contact with such travelers. The three residents of Shizuoka Prefecture became the first patients infected with the coronavirus variant to have no history of overseas travel or contact with travelers from abroad. This is raising fears that the variant may be spreading through community transmission. However, health minister Norihisa Tamura called on residents not to panic, given that there have been no other reports of infections with the coronavirus variant in the prefecture. “(The variant) is not spreading in Shizuoka,” he said at a news conference on Jan. 19. Tamura also urged people to continue taking thorough precautions against the virus, including wearing face masks, washing hands and using hand sanitizer, saying such measures are also effective against the variant. The variant had been detected in 57 countries as of Jan. 18, and community-acquired infections were confirmed in 20 countries, according to researchers at the University of Edinburgh in Britain. In Japan, the number of patients infected with the variant totaled 47 after the strain was detected in two asymptomatic patients on Jan. 19. The two men, both in their 30s, arrived at Narita Airport on Jan. 10, one from Britain and the other from Ghana, and had been confirmed infected with the novel coronavirus at airport quarantine.

The measure will be in place from Jan. 20 through Feb. 7. “The health care system is on the verge of collapse,” Tamaki said on Jan. 19, after the prefecture confirmed 113 new novel coronavirus infections. “All residents need to change their behavior.” The prefectural government is currently asking bars, restaurants and other businesses in seven cities to close by 10 p.m. It will extend the request to cover all similar establishments across Okinawa Prefecture and urge them to move up their closing time to 8 p.m. from Jan. 22 to Feb. 7. Businesses that comply with the new request for shortened operating hours can each receive 40,000 yen ($385) a day as financial support. To gain aid, the prefecture will ask the central government to include it in the state of emergency that currently covers 11 prefectures, or designate Okinawa Prefecture as an area that requires measures equivalent to the emergency declaration. Okinawa prefectural authorities are urging residents and visitors from other prefectures to refrain from going out and avoid nonessential travel between Okinawa and areas under the central government’s state of emergency.

The health ministry announced on Jan. 18 that the variant was detected in samples taken from three people in their 20s to 60s who had neither traveled abroad recently nor had contact with overseas travelers, indicating that they contracted it through community transmission. Takaji Wakita, head of the National Institute of Infectious Diseases, however, ruled out the possibility that the variant is spreading in Shizuoka Prefecture, during a news conference the same day. “At the moment, the mutated strain of the virus is not the dominant variant spreading in the area,” Wakita said, though he called for a stronger analysis of patients' samples. Two women in Shizuoka, on e in her 20s and another in her 40s, along with a man there in his 60s, tested positive for the variant, the ministry said. T he woman in her 40s had close contact with the patient in her 20s. All three developed COVID-19 symptoms in early January and later tested positive for the virus.

Lawmakers of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party and its coalition partner, Komeito, on Jan. 18 gave the nod to the government bills, which would strengthen restrictions on private rights. The legislation will be submitted to the Diet after gaining Cabinet approval this week. In his policy speech the same day in the Diet, Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga said the bills will enhance the effectiveness of two existing laws: the special measures law to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic and the Infectious Disease Law. The government seeks to enact the amended laws in early February to give authorities more power to ensure businesses and infected patients cooperate in efforts to bring the spreading virus under control. The existing laws do not contain any penalties for refusals to cooperate with requests for cooperation. The revision of the special measures law centers on introducing a maximum administrative penalty of 500,000 yen against businesses that do not comply with orders to close or shorten operating hours under a state of emergency issued by the central government. The revision would also allow prefectural governors to exercise the authority to effectively order restaurants and other establishments to change their operating hours. Governors would be able to set a period up to six months for priority measures in their jurisdictions to defeat the virus even before the central government issues a state of emergency there. If business operators do not follow governors’ orders during the designated period, they would be required to pay a fine up to 300,000 yen. In addition, authorities would be able to inspect such businesses or ask for reports before issuing the orders. If they refuse, they would be slapped with a fine of 200,000 yen. The revision bill also calls for providing relief funds and other necessary assistance to businesses. The original draft bill did not explicitly spell out these steps, but they became clearer after pressure from the opposition bloc. Assistance to health care workers will be included. The amendment of the Infectious Disease Law would include a provision to criminally punish infected individuals if they reject instructions to be hospitalized. They could be sentenced to a one-year prison term or receive a maximum fine of 1 million yen. If infected individuals decline to cooperate with public health officials on identifying the routes of transmission without reasonable grounds, they could be fined up to 500,000 yen. But the proposed imposition of criminal penalties is drawing fire from experts. They said the step could end up jeopardizing public health officials’ efforts to contain the disease because many people may decide not to be tested for the virus in fear of the criminal penalties and discrimination if the results are positive. Legal scholars and assembly members at the local level raised doubts about the constitutionality of the revision bill due in part to the absence of a setup to ensure local authorities exercise their expanded authority appropriately.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14118865

Yasutoshi Nishimura, the state minister in charge of economic revitalization and responding to the coronavirus crisis, said on Jan. 14 that the government is planning to designate Hiroshima city as a special area subject to the same measures as Tokyo and the 10 other prefectures that have been placed under the state of emergency. The government has been reluctant to declare a nationwide state of emergency and opted for a piecemeal approach instead. The announcement comes as COVID-19 cases are soaring in Hiroshima city, which is heaping pressure onto its medical system and rapidly filling up hospital capacity. The special designation is expected to end Feb. 7, the same day the state of emergency is expected to expire for Tokyo and the 10 other prefectures. “We would like to do it as soon as possible,” Nishimura said. Once that happens, Hiroshima city would need to take the same measures as prefectures under the state of emergency, such as requesting that local restaurants and bars curtail their business hours and close by 8 p.m. and urging residents to avoid nonessential outings. The central government would be able to increase financial supports to the city, such as raising the amount of cash handouts from up to 40,000 yen ($385) per day to 60,000 yen for restaurants and bars that cut their business hours. It would also relax some of the requirements for receiving employment subsidies. Nishimura said he spoke with the Hiroshima prefectural government and confirmed that the virus situation in Hiroshima city has been worsening. He said that “he will decide on the designation while discussing with the governor,” regardless of whether prefectures or cities made requests or declared their own emergencies. Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga said at a Jan. 13 news conference that he would expand support to areas approaching an acute surge in infections if they reinforce their virus countermeasures. Should the government decide to support Hiroshima city in this unique way, it would become the first municipality in Japan to be designated as a special zone akin to being placed under a state of emergency. Nishimura said that there are no other municipalities the government is currently in discussions with about this kind of designation.

As of Jan. 13, the accumulated total of COVID-19 cases in Tokyo was 78,566, the most in the country, followed by Osaka with 35,908 cases. The Osaka prefectural government says its high death toll stems partly from an increase in infections among elderly people, who are at a higher risk of developing serious symptoms. Between Nov. 29 and Dec. 24, the prefecture confirmed 2,805 new COVID-19 patients aged 60 or older, accounting for about 33 percent of all new infection cases. Over the same period, Tokyo reported 2,482 new patients 60 or older, or about 18 percent of its total. Osaka Prefecture found 127 group infections at nursing homes, medical institutions and elsewhere from Oct. 10, the date considered the start of “the third wave” in the prefecture, through Jan. 11. The number of COVID-19 deaths increased sharply from December. The death rate among COVID-19 patients in Osaka Prefecture was 1.9 percent from Oct. 10 through Jan. 5, 0.4 point higher than the rate during “the second wave” and 0.6 point higher than the nationwide rate in the third wave. According to the health ministry, Osaka Prefecture has about 20,000 facilities for elderly people, the most in Japan and about 400 more than Tokyo, including special nursing care homes and visiting care service centers. “When community transmission increases, more elderly people get infected because there are so many facilities serving or accommodating them in Osaka Prefecture,” Osaka Governor Hirofumi Yoshimura told reporters on Jan. 12. “It is important to prevent the virus from spreading within those facilities to reduce the number of deaths.”",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14108953
0,Indicators point to state of emergency for 3 more prefectures,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"January 15, 2021 at 16:30 JST"," Three prefectures not covered by the state of emergency each have at least four of six indicators showing they have already entered the most serious stage in the spread of novel coronavirus infections. A government panel of experts handling the COVID-19 health crisis put together the six indicators along with a four-stage classification of where a region stands in terms of infections. Benchmark figures for each indicator determine what stage a region is in. But there is no ironclad formula to automatically designate a stage. Still, prefectural governments have been encouraged to use the indicators, which include infection rates and number of available hospital beds, to decide what measures to take to control the spread of the virus. A study by The Asahi Shimbun found that 14 prefectures, including the 11 under the state of emergency, had at least four indicators at the most serious stage 4 level. The other three prefectures were Kumamoto and Miyazaki on the main southern island of Kyushu as well as Okinawa. A stage 4 designation indicates an “explosion” of new COVID-19 cases and that a state of emergency should be seriously considered. According to the Asahi study as of Jan. 12, four prefectures covered by the state of emergency--Chiba, Tokyo, Hyogo and Fukuoka--were at the stage 4 level in all six indicators. Tochigi, Kanagawa and Osaka prefectures, which are also listed under the state of emergency, were at the stage 4 level in five indicators, as well as Kumamoto Prefecture, also on Kyushu. Saitama, Gifu, Aichi, Kyoto, Miyazaki and Okinawa prefectures exceeded the stage 4 level in four indicators. At the stage 3 level, which means COVID-19 infections are spreading rapidly, prefectural governments should ask residents to refrain from traveling outside the prefecture. According to the Asahi study, 32 prefectures had at least three indicators exceeding the stage 3 level and 24 had at least four indicators surpassing that level. The six indicators are: usage rate of hospital beds set aside for COVID-19 patients; the total number of patients receiving hospital treatment or resting at home or at designated accommodation facilities; the weekly rate of positive results for polymerase chain reaction and other tests; the number of new COVID-19 cases over the past week; a comparison with the number of cases from the previous week; and the ratio of patients whose infection route is untraceable. Forty-one of the 47 prefectures in Japan saw increases in the number of new COVID-19 cases over the most recent week in comparison to the previous week. Twenty prefectures exceeded the stage 4 level for the hospital bed usage ratio, and 39 prefectures topped the ratio for the stage 3 level. Government officials had indicated that the state of emergency would be lifted once a region returned to a stage 3 level. But because of the strain on a prefecture’s health care structure even at the stage 3 level, the central government will likely continue with various measures even after the state of emergency is lifted to bring the situation to stage 2 or lower. A prefecture at stage 2 is only recording a slight increase in new COVID-19 cases. Satoshi Hori, a professor of infection control at Juntendo University in Tokyo, blamed both the government and the general public for failing to bring the spread of new infections under control. “Infections exploded while the central government was wringing its hands over what to do,” Hori said. “The situation was made worse because it did not take seriously the scientific basis for what was occurring and placed greater emphasis on economic activity. “At the same time, half of the blame must go to the general public, which did not take the situation seriously and allowed infections to spread through various opportunities to wine and dine,” he said. The surge in new cases has prompted some prefectural governments to issue their own limited warnings or declarations to residents and businesses in their jurisdictions. Kumamoto Governor Ikuo Kabashima on Jan. 11 said the prefecture had entered stage 4, after five of the six indicators had exceeded the benchmark levels set for that stage. Of particular concern was the hospital bed usage ratio, which reached 60 percent on Jan. 11 for the entire prefecture and topped 90 percent for the prefectural capital of Kumamoto city. Three days later, the Kumamoto prefectural government issued a declaration, urging residents to take anti-virus measures. Also on Jan. 14, Mie Prefecture released its own declaration, calling for caution about an emergency situation. “We are at the brink of whether we can prevent an explosive surge in new infections in our prefecture,” Mie Governor Eikei Suzuki said. However, Mie was not placed under the expanded state of emergency, while its neighbors of Aichi and Gifu were included. Miyazaki Prefecture, which had a record 105 new COVID-19 cases on Jan. 7, has issued its own state of emergency covering the period from Jan. 9 to 22. Although the central government’s state of emergency for the 11 prefectures is scheduled to end on Feb. 7, some governors said it should be kept in place until a region returns to stage 2. Kanagawa Governor Yuji Kuroiwa said lifting the state of emergency when a prefecture was still at stage 3 would only lead to another surge in new infections. Kamon Iizumi, governor of Tokushima Prefecture on the main island of Shikoku, said the state of emergency should only be lifted after evidence has been presented that a region is moving toward stage 2. He said the government lifted the state of emergency last spring when Tokyo had still not brought its new cases under control, which led to a second wave in the summer.

Saito, 50, of Utsunomiya, Tochigi Prefecture, who took a train to his company’s Tokyo office, said Tokyoites appear to be letting their guard down against the novel coronavirus, compared with the first state of emergency last spring. “I have no choice but to go to the office because I need to train new employees, including those coming from Osaka,” he said. “But I am worried about the crowded trains. I want to work from home more often.” Few changes were observed in many parts of Japan over the coronavirus pandemic on the first morning after seven prefectures joined the greater Tokyo area under the state of emergency. Tochigi Prefecture is among the seven prefectures that are now covered by the emergency, in addition to the first batch of Tokyo and three neighboring prefectures of Saitama, Kanagawa and Chiba. Asahi Okajima, a second-year high school student who commutes to Tokyo from Satte, Saitama Prefecture, echoed a similar concern to Saito's. “Trains are as crowded as before,” the student said. “It is scary to be in this situation every day.” The latest emergency, which runs through Feb. 7, is the second after the first was put in place between April and May. Many shops and restaurants in Osaka, Kyoto and Hyogo prefectures, which are under the expanded state of emergency, began closing at 8 p.m. on Jan. 13 in compliance with local authorities’ request. Restaurant chains in the prefectures, including Gyoza no Ohsho, which serves gyoza dumplings, and Mister Donut fast food restaurants, will end indoor dining and drinking at 8 p.m. but continue offering take-out food after that. Many supermarkets there are set to maintain their current hours to capitalize on demand from people staying at home. They shut down or closed early during the last state of emergency. At JR Nagoya Station in Nagoya, a 60-year-old company employee said the number of commuters was only slightly smaller than before on the morning of Jan. 14. “During the last state of emergency, crowds were much smaller,” he said. Aichi Prefecture is also covered by the state of emergency. In Fukuoka, also under the state of emergency, a part-time worker said there are as many commuters as before passing through an underground shopping arcade. The worker, a 63-year-old woman, said she is not as anxious as she was during the previous emergency declaration.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14106486
0,Lifting state of emergency too soon may lead to another in April,['By AKIYOSHI ABE/ Staff Writer'],"January 14, 2021 at 18:29 JST"," Ending the current state of emergency immediately after Tokyo’s daily new COVID-19 cases dip below 500 could necessitate another declaration within two months, an epidemiology expert warned. If anti-virus measures are eased right after the capital's daily tally falls under the 500 mark on Feb. 24, the count will climb to roughly pre-declaration levels by April 14, according to a simulation by Hiroshi Nishiura, a professor of theoretical epidemiology at Kyoto University. Japan's second state of emergency over the pandemic, issued for Tokyo and three neighboring prefectures on Jan. 7, expires on Feb. 7. Nishiura submitted his findings to a meeting of a panel of experts advising the health ministry on the pandemic on Jan. 13. His simulation examined various scenarios of how new COVID-19 cases would rise or fall in the capital depending on what measures were implemented to stop them after the new state of emergency was issued. Curbing the spread of the novel coronavirus to the second-highest stage 3 of Japan's four-stage virus alert level is one of the government's conditions for lifting the one-month emergency declaration. Tokyo is deemed at stage 4 if it has a daily average of 500 or more new cases, while stage 3 is declared when the number is 300 or more, according to the guideline compiled by the government’s expert panel on the pandemic. A key point of Nishiura's simulation is the so-called effective reproduction number, which shows how many people one COVID-19 patient has infected. New infections are deemed to have stopped spreading if the number falls below 1. In late December, the data for the capital was an average 1.1. Under Nishiura’s simulation, if the effective reproduction number was reduced to about 0.88 following the declaration of the current state of emergency, Tokyo's number of new virus cases would drop to under 500 on Feb. 24. If anti-virus measures are eased immediately after Feb. 24, the number of new virus cases will return to approximately pre-declaration levels by April 14, with the effective reproduction number rising to around 1.1, according to the simulation. Experts on a separate pandemic advisory panel raised an objection to the government's conditions for lifting the state of emergency at a Jan. 7 panel meeting. As a result, the government revised its basic package of measures to prevent the spread of infections, which outlines the contents of a state of emergency. It added a new policy stating that necessary measures will remain in place even after the state of emergency is lifted until the spread of the virus is curbed to the equivalent of stage 2 or lower. But Nishiura questioned the wisdom of abandoning the state of emergency and merely maintaining certain anti-virus measures. “I don’t understand why the state of emergency won't remain in place until the level of infections is brought down to stage 2,” he said.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14106127
0,Nishimura: More prefectures could go under state of emergency,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"January 14, 2021 at 18:14 JST"," The state minister in charge of handling the novel coronavirus pandemic said it is possible more prefectures could be added to the state of emergency depending on new infection trends. Yasutoshi Nishimura, the state minister in charge of economic revitalization who also heads the government’s response to the COVID-19 crisis, said the state of emergency could be expanded beyond the 11 prefectures currently subject to it. “Additional prefectures might be included depending on the infection situation,” Nishimura said at an Upper House Cabinet Committee meeting on Jan. 14 in response to a question from Hideya Sugio, a member of the opposition Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan. But Nishimura said a state of emergency would not be extended to regions where new infections are under control, pointing to areas such as the Tohoku region in northern Japan and the Sanin region on the Sea of Japan coast of western Honshu island. “We have to be cautious about including such areas for coverage under the state of emergency at the present time,” Nishimura said. “But we are keeping various options in mind to deal with worst-case scenarios in which there is no decrease (in new cases).” Shigeru Omi, who chairs the government panel of experts dealing with the health scare, also appeared before the committee to address what should be done if the spread of infections is not contained within a month. He warned that declaring a state of emergency is not a silver bullet. “It would not be possible to stop the spread with just a state of emergency declaration, so a stronger measure would be needed,” Omi said. He said one option would be to allow prefectural governors to request that businesses in their jurisdictions temporarily suspend operations.

0,Suga sought ‘proactive’ image in widening state of emergency,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"January 14, 2021 at 18:00 JST"," Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga, again swayed by unfavorable public opinion polls, placed Fukuoka Prefecture under the state of emergency for the novel coronavirus even though the governor said it was not necessary, sources said. Unlike the other six prefectures that were added to the state of emergency list on Jan. 13, Fukuoka officials never requested that their jurisdiction be included. In fact, the sources said that Fukuoka Governor Hiroshi Ogawa specifically told Yasutoshi Nishimura, the state minister in charge of economic revitalization who also heads the central government’s effort to deal with the COVID-19 crisis, that there was no need to include Fukuoka during two phone calls on Jan. 12. But negative public opinion surveys in recent days pushed the Suga administration to take what it considered a proactive measure concerning the prefecture on the main southern island of Kyushu. Japan Broadcasting Corp. (NHK) on Jan. 12 released the results of a nationwide survey that showed 79 percent of respondents believe the government was too late in declaring the state of emergency for Tokyo and three neighboring prefectures on Jan. 7. Forty-seven percent of respondents said the state of emergency should be declared for other areas, while 33 percent said it should cover the entire nation. “We are very concerned about public opinion,” a source in the prime minister’s office said about the latest expansion of the state of emergency. “It was difficult for the central government to refuse requests submitted by prefectural governors.” The Suga administration has abruptly changed course in the past because of public opinion surveys. Suga had long insisted that the Go To Travel tourism promotion campaign, a pet project, would continue despite rising numbers of new COVID-19 cases. However, the prime minister suddenly announced on Dec. 14 that the campaign would be suspended over the year-end and New Year period. The suspension will now continue until Feb. 7 when the state of emergency is scheduled to end. One reason for the suspension of the campaign was plunging approval ratings for the Suga Cabinet, sources said. Top officials appear very concerned about being viewed as taking a reactive stance. At a Jan. 12 news conference, Aichi Governor Hideaki Omura revealed that Nishimura told him the central government did not want to be seen as declaring the state of emergency in response to requests from the governors. That led Omura to explain, “Since that is the stance of the central government, we decided to take the position of ‘sharing a sense of crisis’ with the central government.” Aichi was one of the seven prefectures placed under the state of emergency on Jan. 14. During his phone calls with Ogawa, the Fukuoka governor, Nishimura tried to gain his understanding by explaining that concentrated efforts were needed to prevent infections from spreading from major urban areas to neighboring regions. In fact, other prefectures on Kyushu seemed relieved that Fukuoka was included. COVID-19 cases have been increasing this month, and some officials have pointed the finger at Fukuoka. On Jan. 13, Yoshinori Yamaguchi, the governor of neighboring Saga Prefecture, told reporters, “Most of the recent positive tests came from Fukuoka Prefecture.” In Oita Prefecture, another nearby prefecture, many new COVID-19 cases involved individuals who returned to their family homes from Fukuoka Prefecture and elsewhere over the New Year holiday period. One-third of the 180 new cases between Jan. 1 and 13 were those who returned to Oita or their family and acquaintances. Tochigi Prefecture, which lies northeast of Tokyo, was included in the state of emergency even though other neighboring prefectures, such as Ibaraki and Gunma, also have commuters who work in the greater Tokyo metropolitan area. The main reason Tochigi was included was the large number of COVID-19 cases per 100,000 people. “I asked that we be included in order to implement strong infection-prevention measures under the state of emergency declared by the central government,” Tochigi Governor Tomikazu Fukuda said at a Jan. 13 news conference. For the one-week period to Jan. 10, Tochigi had 43.85 cases per 100,000 people, the third highest figure in Japan behind Tokyo and Kanagawa. A Tochigi prefectural government official handling health care policy said medical institutions and hotels accepting COVID-19 patients were close to reaching their capacity. As of Jan. 12, there were 1,313 patients requiring hospitalization or rest and recuperation at accommodation facilities. However, Tochigi only has enough room for 617 patients, and it also lacks sufficient numbers of nurses or public health officials. As a result, 970 patients were asked to rest at home. Two of them died. Fukuda had already issued a warning about the prefecture’s health care structure on Dec. 23 because the number of COVID-19 patients with severe symptoms exceeded 10. He called on residents to refrain from unnecessary outings, but the situation worsened after Jan. 1. Suga was vague at his Jan. 13 news conference about whether the state of emergency would be further expanded. He said the central government would provide similar monetary support to bars and restaurants that cooperate with requests to shorten business hours as well as to hospitals that set up more rooms to treat those with severe symptoms, even in prefectures that are not currently covered by the state of emergency.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14106156
0,Japan’s entry ban now covers world; anti-virus rules tightened,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"January 14, 2021 at 17:53 JST"," After backpedaling, Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga announced that Japan’s entry ban would cover all nonresident foreign nationals from Jan. 14 to Feb. 7, as the nation struggles to contain the novel coronavirus. The wider ban now includes arrivals from 10 countries and one region for business purposes. The government also announced possible punishments against Japanese and foreign residents who return from overseas but do not follow anti-virus rules. “In addition to Japan’s serious condition, people are growing anxious as cluster infections with a coronavirus variant found in Britain have been discovered in the country,” Suga said at a news conference on Jan. 13. “The government will suspend the entry (of the targeted countries and region) to remove all risk factors.” Individuals who have already obtained visas can enter Japan until midnight on Jan. 20. The 10 countries and one region are: China (excluding Hong Kong and Macau), South Korea, Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia, Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Taiwan, Singapore and Brunei. They had been exempted from the ban because they were considered areas that had the virus under control. Under tighter rules, all Japanese and foreign residents returning from overseas will be asked to sign a paper promising to self-isolate at home for two weeks after their arrival and not use public transportation during that period. They will also be asked to keep records on their locations during that period and present data to public health officials upon their request. If they do not comply, the government may revoke their resident status, publish their names and nationalities or place them in quarantine facilities, officials said. The new measures were devised after a man who came from Britain in December dined with 10 individuals before his two-week health monitoring period was over. Two people at that dinner party were later confirmed infected with the coronavirus variant. Previously, people arriving from Britain and South Africa were asked to use an app on their smartphones to keep track of their locations. After a flurry of reports about the spread of the more transmissible coronavirus variant, Japan halted its eased regulations and barred entry of foreign travelers on Dec. 28. But people from the 10 countries and Taiwan on short business stays and technical intern trainees on mid- and long-term stays were still allowed to enter. The government began considering suspending that arrangement on Jan. 4 when it was preparing to declare a second state of emergency for the greater Tokyo area. But Suga, apparently heeding requests from Japanese business circles, insisted that the favorable treatment continue, even after the state of emergency was issued on Jan. 7. The government said it would halt entry from those areas if the new form of the coronavirus was detected there. Suga, however, came under heavy criticism from the public and lawmakers, even from the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, for that decision. “When people in Japan have been asked to avoid nonessential outings under the state of emergency, foreigners are still allowed to enter Japan,” one Diet member said. “It is hard to gain understanding for that policy.”",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14106101

That comment came at the same time as he sternly warned that the current surge in infections is pushing the system past the brink. “Issuing a nationwide state of emergency is an option,” Nakagawa said. “To prevent infections from spreading throughout the country and before it becomes too late, it is critical to implement measures ahead of time.” The same day, Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga added seven more prefectures to the state of emergency that he had initially only declared for Tokyo as well as Kanagawa, Saitama and Chiba prefectures. Nakagawa said the health care system has already started to collapse nationwide, although more critically so in the greater Tokyo area. He pointed to instances where people suffering from a heart attack or stroke had no place to be transported, and times when hospitals in the areas under the state of emergency had to turn down regular outpatients and postpone operations on cancer patients. “If the number of infection cases keeps rising, the health care system could be wiped out,” Nakagawa warned. He criticized the central government for being too slow to respond to the changing situation and waiting until after “all the data that indicate infection levels exceed the standards.” Nakagawa expressed concerns that the number of new cases is significantly larger than in spring 2020, when a state of emergency was declared for the first time.

Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga declared the state of emergency for the three Kansai area prefectures of Osaka, Kyoto and Hyogo, the two Tokai area prefectures of Aichi and Gifu, as well as Tochigi, northeast of Tokyo, and Fukuoka, in Kyushu. The decision came less than a week after Suga on Jan. 7 declared a state of emergency for Tokyo and the three neighboring prefectures of Kanagawa, Saitama and Chiba. At that time, Suga told a news conference that he did not feel there was a need to expand the range of the state of emergency. But since then, governors from various prefectures where novel coronavirus infections are spreading have asked central government officials to include their jurisdictions under the state of emergency. The state of emergency will last until Feb. 7 for all 11 prefectures. The seven additional prefectures will ask bars and restaurants to close their doors at 8 p.m. and call on company employees to work from home or commute on a rotation basis so that 70 percent of workers are not in the office at the same time. At a Jan. 12 meeting of government officials and ruling coalition lawmakers, Suga indicated the central government would begin considering whether to expand the range of the state of emergency, given the various areas that were also recording sharp increases in new COVID-19 cases. The governors of the three Kansai prefectures held a video conference on Jan. 9 with Yasutoshi Nishimura, the state minister for economic revitalization who is also the government point man to deal with the novel coronavirus pandemic. They asked Nishimura to include their prefectures in the state of emergency. On Jan. 12, the governors of Aichi, Gifu and Tochigi prefectures made a similar request to Nishimura. For the seven additional prefectures, the central government is expected to increase the amount paid to businesses that cooperate with shortened-hours requests to 60,000 yen ($580) a day from the current 40,000 yen. A similar move has already been made for the first four prefectures covered under the state of emergency.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14102821
1,"1-month state of emergency able to tame surging virus, Suga says",['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"January 13, 2021 at 18:40 JST"," Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga said he is not thinking about extending the state of emergency over the COVID-19 pandemic, vowing to stem the spread of the disease by Feb. 7, despite widespread skepticism about the effectiveness of the current measures. “The government will work with full force to within a month prevent the spread of infections by all means so that the country will be back to stage 3” of the four-level coronavirus alert level, he said in an interview with The Asahi Shimbun on Jan. 12. The government declared the monthlong emergency from Jan. 7 with the goal of lowering the spread of infections to stage 3. Japan is currently assessed as being in the highest stage 4 of the alert level based on the government's guidelines. Stage 4 means an explosive growth in new cases, while in stage 3 new cases are surging. The state of emergency, Japan's first since April, began first with the greater Tokyo area covered under it. But several other prefectures, including Osaka Prefecture, are expected to be included in it on Jan. 13. A key countermeasure under the declaration centers on restricting restaurants’ operating hours, urging them to close by 8 p.m. While many questioned whether that is enough to turn around the trajectory of the virus within a month, the prime minister said the goal will be achievable if there is strict adherence to the new request. “The emergency was just declared and what we should focus on is to make sure that restaurants are abiding by the request to operate until 8 p.m.,” he said. “I believe we will be able to attain the goal if we push it thoroughly.” Concerning restaurants, he underlined the need to impose a penalty for operators that do not comply with authorities’ request for temporary closure or for shorter operating hours. Suga stressed that promptly revising the special measures law to fight the coronavirus to add a provision concerning the penalty will be a top priority when an ordinary Diet session opens on Jan. 18. His game plan is threefold: first, declaring the state of emergency to slow the spread of viruses; second, making antivirus government measures more workable by punishing businesses that do not comply with authorities through the revised special measures law expected to pass in the Diet in early February; and last, to alleviate public concerns through vaccinations, which are set to begin from late February. Suga also indicated that he will create an environment for the Tokyo Olympic and Paralympic Games to be held “safely” by generating certain results by spring in the fight against the pandemic. But the emergency declaration, which Suga aides described as the government’s “most important message for the population,” has failed to achieve the intended result: reducing contacts among people significantly. Crowd sizes in resort and shopping areas in the Tokyo metropolitan area failed to shrink remarkably on Jan. 9-11, the first holidays after the current emergency declaration, compared with holidays during the first state of emergency, data showed. A member of a government panel of experts on the pandemic said stressing the risks of getting the virus at restaurants has sent the wrong message to the public. “People thought that going out was all right as long as they avoided those places after 8 p.m.,” the member said. The government's position that the single-month state of emergency is sufficient to dial back surging infections may become untenable as more prefectures ask to be covered under it, a senior government official involved in response to the virus measures acknowledged. As for additional steps the government might take in the event that the current measures fail to curb the spread of the virus, Suga did not provide any details, merely reiterating the current measures that are being implemented.

Yasutoshi Nishimura, who is also in charge of economic revitalization efforts, made the comments at a news conference on Jan. 12 out of concern that the government’s call for more self-restraint is not getting through to everyone. The government urged eateries and bars in Tokyo and the three surrounding prefectures under a state of emergency to shorten their hours and close shop by 8 p.m. But when that happened, some people simply switched from going out to dinner to having lunch with others. Nishimura showed concern that people are not getting the message about avoiding nonessential outings. “We are not saying that it is OK to have meals together during lunchtime,” he said. “Please work at home as much as possible and have meals at home.” The government recently revised its basic policy in accordance with the state of emergency declared on Jan. 7. The revised policy asks residents to refrain from unnecessary outings and largely work at home. It also urged event operators to bring about stricter limits on the number of visitors, and it requested eating and drinking establishments--seen as key places where the virus can easily spread--to shorten their business hours. Nishimura reiterated at the Jan. 12 news conference that it is important to stop the steady flow of people into restaurants and bars. But declaring a state of emergency has not stopped some people from flocking to main entertainment and shopping districts in Tokyo and the three neighboring prefectures in the daytime during the three-day holiday period from Jan. 9 through 11. “What we have said in the past was partly misunderstood, but we would like residents to stay at home as much as possible, including during the daytime,” Nishimura said. He talked about the previous state of emergency declared last April and said if the shortened business hours or telework are adopted across the board, “there are some possibilities that we can halve the number of new cases of infection in a month.” Health minister Norihisa Tamura also said Jan. 13 that there is a “misunderstanding” among some people that they do not have to refrain from eating out in large numbers before 8 p.m. “We are asking the public not to engage in nonessential outings even before 8 p.m.,” he told a health ministry expert panel on novel coronavirus measures. “We want to seek their understanding.”",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14103463

The daily total of 1,433 new cases marked the first time in two days for the number to top 1,000, according to metropolitan government officials. The tally dipped below the 1,000 mark for the first time in eight days on Jan. 12, when 970 novel coronavirus infections were confirmed. The capital had a record 144 COVID-19 patients in serious condition on Jan. 12, but the number dropped to 141, the officials said. Tokyo defines serious cases as those requiring ventilators or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, also known as an ECMO lung bypass machine. But such equipment, as well as hospital beds, are becoming in short supply in Tokyo. On three straight days this month, Tokyo reported more than 2,000 new COVID-19 cases. As of Jan. 12, a record high 3,427 patients were hospitalized with the disease in the capital. “It’s like playing a cat-and-mouse game as the daily number of new cases exceeds 2,000,” Haruo Ozaki, head of the Tokyo Medical Association, said at a news conference on Jan. 12. “I would like each resident to think carefully about their behavior to contain the spread of the virus under the month-long state of emergency.”",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14103554
1,Small businesses hurt by state of emergency eligible for relief,['By AYUMI SHINTAKU/ Staff Writer'],"January 13, 2021 at 17:49 JST"," Business partners with restaurants and bars in Tokyo and the three neighboring prefectures along with small and midsize businesses hard-hit by the state of emergency will be eligible for lump-sum payouts from the government. Economy minister Hiroshi Kajiyama announced the relief effort at a news conference on Jan. 12. Among those eligible, a corporation or a sole proprietor can receive up to 400,000-yen ($3,862) or 200,000-yen payouts, respectively. The government is seeking to start accepting applications in March after discussing the measure thoroughly. According to the economy ministry, business operators that service restaurants or bars in Tokyo and the three neighboring prefectures directly or indirectly will be eligible for the cash handouts. In addition, small or midsized operators whose sales in January or February plummeted by 50 percent or more year on year, affected directly by the government's request to avoid nonessential outings, are eligible for the same payouts. The operators must provide proof of their decline in sales. If they meet the requirement, businesses in broader categories and wider areas are expected to be added to those eligible for the financial assistance. Specifically, those businesses will include karaoke parlors, taxi operators and souvenir shops. If more prefectures are placed under the state of emergency, the cash handouts will be extended to cover those areas. Kajiyama also said that the government will provide financial assistance to event operators by covering cancellation fees for venues if concerts, plays or other events scheduled to be held in the areas brought under the state of emergency are called off. The amount of the financial assistance is undecided, but will be announced soon. In addition, financial assistance of up to 100 million yen being offered for small and midsize companies trying to change their businesses amid the pandemic will be prioritized for those most impacted by the state of emergency. Funds for the program were incorporated in this fiscal year's third supplemental budget.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14103114

1,Tokyo-area railways to stop last trains earlier starting Jan. 20,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"January 13, 2021 at 15:32 JST"," East Japan Railway Co. (JR East) will move up its last-train departure times in the greater Tokyo area by up to about 30 minutes, starting from Jan. 20. Other private railroad companies in the region are expected to move in lockstep with JR East. The move comes in response to the second state of emergency declared over the novel coronavirus pandemic, although it is not yet clear how long the measure will be in place. JR East announced schedule changes on Jan. 13 to the last-departing trains on these lines: Yamanote, Keihin-Tohoku, Negishi, Sobu (local), Chuo (rapid and local), Joban (rapid), Saikyo, Kawagoe, Tokaido, Yokosuka, Musashino and Keiyo. Last trains will stop running earlier by anywhere from eight to 32 minutes, depending on the line. Tokyo and Saitama, Chiba and Kanagawa prefectures have urged railway companies to adjust their schedules as soon as possible to limit travel to prevent the virus from further spreading. They have pushed for the schedule revisions since Jan. 7, when Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga issued a state of emergency for the capital and the three neighboring prefectures. Under JR East's new scheduling, 42 trains running in the late-night hours on weekdays and 40 late-night trains on weekends will be canceled. Some in the rail industry have repeatedly expressed doubts about the effectiveness of reducing the number of late-night trains as a coronavirus countermeasure, since they do not carry many passengers to begin with. Nonetheless, the companies have decided to comply with requests from local governments. The revisions come ahead of somewhat similar spring timetable adjustments amid the pandemic. JR East had announced plans in October for the last trains on 17 lines operating within a 100-kilometer zone centering around Tokyo Station to depart earlier, by up to 37 minutes, beginning this spring. Other private railroad companies also announced earlier departure times for last trains by as much as roughly 30 minutes, expected to be made in the spring when they revise their train schedules. But the companies had said the main purpose for the coming spring schedule adjustments is to secure time necessary for maintenance checks between the last train at night and the first train in the morning. That said, the companies are not simply moving up their spring timetable revisions with their new pandemic-related schedule changes starting from Jan. 20, and the move will only affect trains running late in the night.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14102594

The state of emergency for those three prefectures will end on Feb. 7, the same date as for Tokyo and three prefectures surrounding it, according to government sources. On Jan. 12, Aichi and Gifu prefectures asked the central government to issue a state of emergency for them. It will consider the requests, along with whether to bring them under a state of emergency at the same time as the three Kansai prefectures. “Osaka Prefecture had seen a temporary decline in new COVID-19 cases, but they have increased again,” a senior official from the prime minister’s office said on Jan. 12. “So, we decided to consider the state of emergency.” The official said the call on Aichi and Gifu prefectures will come after weighing expert analysis on the situation. “The possibility that Aichi and Gifu prefectures will be brought under the state of emergency at the same time as those Kansai prefectures is not zero,” another senior official in the Suga administration said. But top government officials denied any possibility of declaring a state of emergency for all of Japan’s prefectures simultaneously. The government’s advisory committee, which is comprised of experts on infectious diseases and the economy, will convene on Jan. 13 and provide input about placing more prefectures under a state of emergency. After the government explains the issue to the Diet, it will convene its task force before it decides. Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga is then expected to explain the government’s reasoning at a news conference. The government is planning to hike its cash handouts to restaurants and bars cooperating with requests to shorten business hours and close by 8 p.m., raising it from 40,000 yen ($383) a day to 60,000 yen, sources said. That is under the assumption that the governments of any new prefectures brought under a state of emergency would also call on their local eateries to limit their hours.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14100795
0,Kumamoto may ask for state of emergency as it calls stage 4 alert,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"January 12, 2021 at 18:06 JST"," Kumamoto prefectural officials on Jan. 11 announced that spiking local COVID-19 cases now warrant the highest stage 4 of the coronavirus alert level and consideration for being placed under a state of emergency. “We are in a situation where a request for the central government to cover (the prefecture) under a state of emergency needs to be considered,” Kumamoto Governor Ikuo Kabashima said at the prefectural government’s task force meeting on the novel coronavirus pandemic. The governor said he will consult with other governors in Kyushu to make a decision on making a request because the situation will not be resolved unless each prefecture in the region contains the virus surge. The central government’s panel of experts dealing with the pandemic has established a four-stage system to determine a local government’s recommended response to put the brakes on or ease socio-economic activities such as travel and dining out. The highest stage 4 is “an explosion of infections,” according to the panel. In Kumamoto Prefecture, figures in five of six guidelines set by the panel, including the number of weekly new infection cases, exceeded the standard as of Jan. 10, prompting the prefectural government to raise the alert level from 3 to 4. In the most recent week, the number of people who tested positive for the novel coronavirus was 524 as of Jan. 10. According to the panel’s guideline, stage 4 is declared when the number reaches the level of “more than 25 cases per 100,000 population,” which is equivalent to 437 in Kumamoto Prefecture. Prefectural officials said the figures in four other factors reached the standard. In response, officials have extended the request for restaurants and businesses in central Kumamoto that serve alcohol to close at 10 p.m. until Jan. 24. The request, issued on Dec. 30, was scheduled to end on Jan. 11. Businesses that comply will receive 520,000 yen ($5,000), in principle.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14100925
0,Surge in virus deaths feared as hospitals can’t treat all patients,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"January 12, 2021 at 18:01 JST"," Health experts warn that the rapidly rising death toll from COVID-19 could worsen as the continuing increase in seriously ill patients has now forced overrun hospitals to decide who gets full medical treatment. The number of fatalities topped 4,000 nationwide on Jan. 9, and Asahi Shimbun calculations showed that more than 1,500, or 40 percent, of the deaths occurred over the month ending Jan. 10. The seven-day average number of deaths from COVID-19 was eight at the end of October. The figure climbed to 22 at the end of November and to 53 at the end of last month. If the current pace continues, the death toll is projected to hit 5,000 by the end of this month. Hospital beds, particularly in urban centers, are filling up during the third and most severe wave of novel coronavirus infections. In some areas, ventilators and other sophisticated equipment are now unavailable for COVID-19 patients in serious condition. The Tokyo metropolitan government describes serious COVID-19 cases as those that require ventilators or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, an ECMO lung bypass machine. As of Jan. 5, Tokyo said 111 patients were using such equipment. However, many patients with serious symptoms have not requested the breathing-assistance equipment. If they are included, the total number of serious cases is 186 as of that day in the capital. An additional 170 patients in Tokyo were in conditions that could require ventilators at any minute or had just recovered to a level where the equipment could be removed. Local authorities’ figures for serious cases alone do not reflect the dire situation that hospitals are now facing, the health experts said. DYING WITHOUT VENTILATORS Hideaki Oka, a professor of infectious disease internal medicine at the Saitama Medical Center in Kawagoe, Saitama Prefecture, just north of Tokyo, said some seriously ill COVID-19 patients at his hospital have been without ventilators because there are not enough staff workers trained to use the devices safely. “Patients are waiting for the end of their lives without ventilators after available drugs failed to turn around their condition,” he said. Oka oversees 23 beds for COVID-19 patients with mild or moderate symptoms, as well as four intensive care beds for serious cases. Most of the patients who have been admitted to his hospital, which is affiliated with Saitama Medical University, since the third wave started in autumn are either elderly or have pre-existing conditions, putting them at a higher risk of developing serious symptoms. With the number of serious cases surging since December, all four beds for such patients had been occupied by the beginning of this month. Three beds set aside for patients with mild or moderate symptoms were converted for those in serious condition. Oka said it is now difficult to take in additional patients. “We have accepted elderly patients in serious condition from other facilities on the condition that they made clear they would not seek treatment” using ventilators or other devices, he said. “Triage of patients has been under way on the front line.” Hospitals in Osaka Prefecture are experiencing a similarly dire situation. In the prefecture, 77 percent of the 281 patients who died between Oct. 10 and Dec. 23 were not using ventilators or under intensive care, both of which are supposed to be standard for “serious cases.” Based on trends during the pandemic, a surge in new cases a couple of weeks ago will soon lead to a sharp rise in the number of serious cases. Medical facilities in large cities are already flooded with patients, making it difficult to find unoccupied beds for seriously ill COVID-19 patients. Oka painted a bleak picture for the health care system in many parts of Japan. In the weeks ahead, he said, access to breathing equipment will be limited, and more patients will die from the disease while not receiving aggressive treatment. “As far as seriously ill COVID-19 patients are concerned, hospitals have already lost the ability to treat them all,” he said. “Fatalities could rise sharply in the days ahead, compared with figures to date.” Satoshi Hori, a professor of infectious disease control with Juntendo University in Tokyo, echoed a similar view, saying medical treatment for serious cases will become scarcer. Hori called on young people to behave cautiously and responsibly, even though those in younger age groups are less likely to develop serious symptoms after contracting the virus. “They could end up transmitting the virus unwittingly to the elderly and people with underlying conditions,” he said. “They should avoid confined places and dining together with friends.”",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14100501

The variant was found in airport tests on a man in his 40s, a woman in her 30s and two teens, the ministry said Sunday. Japan was working with other nations, the WHO and other medical experts to analyze the new version of the virus, and it was still unclear whether available vaccines would work.

0,Asahi survey: 67 percent fear most social stigma of having COVID-19,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"January 10, 2021 at 18:20 JST"," Nearly 70 percent of respondents to an Asahi Shimbun survey are more concerned with the social stigma of contracting the novel coronavirus than the detrimental effects to their health. In the survey on the public perception of the coronavirus pandemic, 26 percent said they feel “to a great extent” that contracting the virus is alarming because they “are concerned about how others in their neighborhood and workplaces will view them than the danger to their health.” Forty-one percent said they feel so “to some extent.” Those who responded “not so much” and “not at all” totaled 23 percent and 9 percent, respectively. The share of respondents who are more worried about the stigma than the threat to their health is larger in the working population, the survey found. The figure was 74 percent for those in their 50s or younger, while that for those in their 60s or older came to 60 percent. As for respondents in households with a child younger than 18, it was 75 percent. The questionnaire survey was conducted between November and December, through 3,000 voters nationwide selected randomly. There were 2,126 valid responses, or 71 percent of the total. The survey also showed that 42 percent are concerned “to a great extent” and 45 percent “to some extent” about the likelihood of developing serious symptoms after becoming infected with the virus. Even of the respondents who replied that they are concerned “to a great extent” about becoming seriously ill, 66 percent said they fear more what others will think of them than of their own health. Against the backdrop seems to lie the public’s perceived criticism and blame of those getting infected. Twenty-seven percent chose “applicable to a great extent” when asked if “a person should be blamed for contracting the virus while going out despite authorities’ request to stay home.” Combined with 50 percent that chose “applicable to some extent,” 77 percent feel they have only themselves to blame for getting infected while being out. The poll also showed a similar tendency about wearing masks. Eleven percent said they wear masks because they are worried “to a great extent” about how they look in public rather than as a precautionary measure. The ratio of those who picked “to some extent” was 24 percent. Men in their 30s constituted a combined 47 percent, the highest among all age groups. As for people not wearing masks on a train or in a supermarket, 34 percent said they are annoyed “to a great extent” while 41 percent said they were annoyed “to some extent.” The ratio of women who chose either of those answers came to 78 percent, compared with 71 percent of men. The survey also showed that 82 percent of the respondents who are concerned “to a great extent” about developing serious symptoms are annoyed by people without masks. Although the central government is weighing introducing penalties for restaurants that do not comply with closure requests, respondents were more cautious about the approach, which is seen as restricting personal rights. A combined 33 percent favored imposing a fine on restaurants that do not follow a closure order. The ratio of those who supported letting restaurants decide whether to close or not if requested by authorities was a combined 62 percent. With regard to restrictions on individuals’ movements, a combined 33 percent backed fining violators, according to the survey, while a combined 62 percent preferred having authorities ask the public not to go out, leaving it ultimately up to every person to decide.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14096508

Sumo elder Oguruma, the JSA director in charge of organizing the tournament, indicated the association may cancel the event after consulting with infectious disease experts if more cases are detected in the coming days. The five--Chiyoshoma, a wrestler in the top makuuchi division, and three peers in his Kokonoe stable, as well as one wrestler in the Tomozuna stable, tested positive for the coronavirus in the testing of about 900 wrestlers, stablemasters and staff workers, according to the association. The number of wrestlers in the second-tier juryo division or above who will be absent stands at 15. The 65 wrestlers represent about 10 percent of the overall total of active competitors. The testing of all JSA members followed the confirmation of the infection of yokozuna Hakuho of the Miyagino stable earlier this month and an outbreak that occurred in late December in the Arashio stable. The JSA decided to keep all the wrestlers of the four stables out of the 15-day New Year Grand Sumo Tournament that opens at Ryogoku Kokugikan in Tokyo due to the positive tests and close contact with the infected. The tourney will open with a reduced number of spectators, although up to 5,000 are still expected on the opening days in the arena, which has a capacity of about 11,000. The absence of the 65 wrestlers means that the tournament will have about 20 bouts fewer than the opening day of last year’s New Year Grand Sumo Tournament and run about an hour shorter.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14096186

1,Penalties eyed for virus patients who refuse hospitalization,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"January 9, 2021 at 18:30 JST"," The health ministry plans to introduce penalties for those confirmed with COVID-19 but who refuse to be hospitalized. The issue was raised during a Jan. 8 meeting of government officials and lawmakers from the ruling coalition and opposition camps. The ministry plans to submit legislation to revise the Infectious Diseases Prevention Law to the ordinary Diet session slated to convene from Jan. 18. Under the Infectious Diseases Prevention Law, prefectural governors can recommend that COVID-19 patients be hospitalized if they feel there is a need and can force individuals who do not comply to enter a hospital. But no penalties exist for those who still do not agree to be hospitalized. The new provision would result in forced hospitalization in such cases. Patients would not be allowed to discharge themselves from a hospital without permission. Last July, a man in Saitama Prefecture who was hospitalized after being confirmed with COVID-19 suddenly left without permission before the treatment had been completed. The health ministry is also considering penalties against individuals who refuse to cooperate with local public health offices trying to track routes of infection. The only penalties currently in the Infectious Diseases Prevention Law are for individuals who deliberately spread dangerous pathogens, such as the Ebola virus. This can result in a sentence of life imprisonment, a prison sentence of at least two years or a fine of at least 10 million yen ($96,190). The Quarantine Law also has penal provisions against individuals who flee even though they have been detained due to fears they are infected. Such individuals face maximum penalties of a one-year prison sentence or a fine of 1 million yen. Ruling coalition officials are calling for maximum penalties of one year imprisonment or a 1 million yen fine for individuals with COVID-19 who refused to be hospitalized. Those who do not cooperate with infection tracking would face a maximum fine of 500,000 yen. Opposition lawmakers urged caution about including such provisions. Tomoko Tamura of the Japanese Communist Party said rather than discuss penalties, the government should do something about those who want to be hospitalized for treatment but cannot do so. The health ministry is also considering revisions to the Infectious Diseases Prevention Law regarding those with minor symptoms or who are asymptomatic. Wording would be included so such individuals can self-isolate either at home or an accommodation facility. Until now, there was no legal basis for such measures, so the health ministry had to issue notices about options available. Ministry officials are hoping that writing such provisions into law would make the measures more effective. They are also seeking to share infection tracking data recorded by local public health offices among officials of the city government where the offices are located and the relevant prefectural authorities. This is because prefectural governments do not have access to the data collected by the city offices.

1,Two negative COVID-19 tests required of all new arrivals,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"January 9, 2021 at 17:35 JST"," Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga was roundly criticized on social media sites for announcing that business and other travelers from 11 nations and regions would continue to be allowed entry into Japan even after his government declared a fresh state of emergency to fight the COVID-19 crisis. Government officials were left scrambling to implement tougher quarantine measures. Social media sites suggested Suga was more concerned about the economy than the public’s health, given that he spoke only a day after announcing a state of emergency for the novel coronavirus pandemic in Tokyo and three neighboring prefectures. Appearing on a TV Asahi news program on Jan. 8, Suga said business and other travelers from China, South Korea and nine other nations and regions would continue to be allowed in. At the same time, government officials said all arrivals in Japan, including Japanese nationals, would be obliged to provide certification they tested negative for COVID-19 within 72 hours of departure as well as take another test upon arrival at a Japanese airport. The tougher quarantine measures were intended to respond to the sharp criticism from lawmakers of both the ruling coalition and opposition camps as well as on social media. Suga said on the TV program entry from the 11 nations and regions was being continued because those areas were considered safe in terms of COVID-19 issues. He said entry would continue to be allowed until community spreading of COVID-19 variants was confirmed in a nation. Passengers arriving from the 11 nations and regions are required to undergo virus tests at airports in Japan from Jan. 9. Arrivals from those areas, excluding Malaysia and Myanmar, had been exempted from tests since November. The government currently bans new entry from about 150 other nations and regions, and all passengers arriving from those areas are tested at Japanese airports.

1,Tokyo nightlife pretty much dead by 8 p.m. as new rules kick in,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"January 9, 2021 at 16:10 JST"," Across the greater Tokyo metropolitan area, bars and restaurants took decidedly different approaches to closing early to comply with the government's latest state of emergency to fight the novel coronavirus pandemic. Friday night, traditionally a time for Tokyoites to let their hair down at the end of a busy work week, was the epitome of quiet in the capital's bustling Shibuya district, which normally comes alive from 8 p.m. or so. On Jan. 8, most bars and restaurants were shutting up by 8 p.m. to ensure compliance, triggering a mass exodus from Shibuya Station as people headed home early instead of the traditional mad crush around midnight for last trains. In announcing the state of emergency on Jan. 7, Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga called on residents of Tokyo and the three neighboring prefectures of Kanagawa, Saitama and Chiba to refrain from unnecessary outings after 8 p.m. He asked bars and restaurants to close their doors at the same time to prevent groups of people risking cluster infections. In the Nonbei Yokocho (Drinkers’ alley) area, famed for its numerous small bars and hole-in-the-wall places to eat, about half of the establishments opted to remain shut on Jan. 8. Those that were still open invariably closed their doors at 8 p.m. One restaurant operator said there were days last year when not a single customer showed up. While she did open on Jan. 8, she complied with the government request to close her premises at 8 p.m. But not all establishments cooperated. One hostess bar manager said his establishment would remain open until around midnight. “We cannot suddenly switch to opening only during the day,” the manager said, adding that the government's offer to pay 60,000 yen ($580) a day to establishments that cooperate with the business strategy was not nearly enough to pay the salaries of staff. Operators of restaurant chains took different approaches to the request to close at 8 p.m. While most major chains closed their outlets at that time, some decided to continue with take-out, delivery and drive-thru services. McDonald’s Japan has about 920 outlets in the four prefectures covered by the state of emergency. While eat-in service will be suspended daily between 8 p.m. and 5 a.m. at all outlets, take-out, delivery and drive-thru services will continue. The measure took effect from Jan. 8 in Tokyo and will begin from Jan. 12 in the three other prefectures. “Gyudon” (beef-and-rice bowl) restaurant chains Yoshinoya Co., Matsuya Foods Co. and Sukiya Co. will continue with take-out service after 8 p.m. But the Kentucky Fried Chicken and Mos Burger fast food chains decided not to provide take-out or delivery services after 8 p.m. Many “izakaya” Japanese-style pub chains decided to remain shut throughout the state of emergency. “The safety of our workers is paramount,” said an official with the Kushikatsu Tanaka chain. Watami Co., which operates about 100 izakaya pubs in the four prefectures, said 83 of them will remain closed for the duration of the state of emergency. About 200 company employees will be posted to locations that are open. “We cannot do business if we can only serve alcohol until 7 p.m.,” said company chairman Miki Watanabe. “Unless something is done, Japan’s restaurant business will collapse.” Industry associations, meantime, were calling on the government to take additional measures. The Japan Food Service Association submitted a request on Jan. 8 for the government to extend the payment of funds to companies that cooperate with requests to close at 8 p.m. to even major chains. Another national organization of restaurants submitted a written expression of disappointment with the government for giving the impression that bars and restaurants were primarily responsible for the spread of COVID-19 cases that triggered the latest state of emergency, the second since last April.

0,Language barrier hinders care for infected foreigners,['By AYAKO NAKADA/ Staff Writer'],"January 7, 2021 at 19:00 JST"," A Nepalese man who lives in Kanagawa Prefecture tested positive for the novel coronavirus, but after some misunderstandings, he decided against self-isolation and stayed at home. His family members later tested positive. Although the government has named foreign communities in Japan as sources of cluster infections, many non-Japanese say they are not receiving adequate information about the pandemic and what steps to take to avoid the contagion. The language barrier is cited as the biggest reason. In addition, some foreign nationals tend to conceal their infections out of fear of losing their jobs or facing further discrimination. Shakya Sandeep, a 38-year-old doctor and a member of the Japan branch of the Non-Resident Nepali Association (NRNA), heard about the Nepalese man’s case in early May last year. The man, who works as a cook at a curry restaurant, tested positive after he suffered from a headache, mild fever and a sense of fatigue. The prefectural government arranged for the man to be transferred to an accommodation facility for treatment. A public health center provided a courtesy car to pick him up from his home. But the Nepalese cook decided not to go. He realized that he would have to read and write Japanese to fill out daily reports on his health condition, but he didn’t have the language skills to perform that task. He also assumed the meals provided to patients at the facility would not accommodate his religious practices. But Sandeep said he heard that another reason for the Nepalese man’s refusal to leave his home was that he was worried about the expenses. The infected man apparently did not know that public funds cover all the costs of isolating COVID-19 patients at accommodation facilities. Sandeep, who came to Japan at the age 18, graduated from Tokyo Medical and Dental University and has worked as a cardiovascular internal medicine doctor for 13 years. He delved further into the situation at foreign communities during the pandemic and said he was shocked at what he found. One Kanagawa prefectural government official admitted that some patients who could not speak Japanese were not allowed to stay at the accommodation facilities at the beginning. Sandeep joined a pandemic-related panel established by the branch in March 2020, when the novel coronavirus was spreading rapidly around Japan. The 28 panel members, including health care workers and interpreters, have tried to spread information about anti-virus measures in Nepalese through videos and other means. “Expat communities are vulnerable to exposure to the virus unless they share necessary information,” Sandeep said. The Cabinet Secretariat, after analyzing domestic news reports and interviewing public health centers, confirmed at least 20 infection clusters involving foreigners from Sept. 1 to Nov. 10. The clusters occurred at dormitories, workplaces and at restaurants where employees entertain customers. The central government’s expert panel on dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic in September suggested strengthening the support system for foreign communities to prevent such infection clusters from occurring. Since then, the government has formed a team to discuss measures to help foreigners survive the pandemic. Takashi Sawada, 60, who heads the Minatomachi Medical Center in Yokohama that has treated many foreign patients, said he was interviewed by the central government. He said he told the officials that information services were needed particularly for Vietnamese, Nepalese and Indonesians, who have increasingly settled in Japan’s labor force. The health ministry in June 2020 started providing a free interpretation service for phone calls from health care workers. The 24-hour service initially covered five languages--English, Chinese, Korean, Spanish and Portuguese. In December, French and Vietnamese were added. Based on a suggestion from the central government’s panel, the ministry included expenses in third supplementary budget for fiscal 2020 so that public health centers nationwide could start using the interpretation service as early as Dec. 25. But the ministry has not decided on whether to include other languages, such as Nepalese and Indonesian. Another fee-based telephonic interpretation service that covers less-common foreign languages has been available to medical institutions since before the pandemic. The first five minutes cost 1,500 yen ($14.50) and 500 yen for every additional minute. The ministry said health-care providers can charge the fees to the patients. Sawada said the cost is one reason foreign nationals are hesitant to use that service. “In order to thoroughly contain the infectious disease, there needs to be an environment where people, regardless of their economic status, can smoothly access health care,” Sawada said. Other problems stand in the way of containing the virus in foreign communities. ‘SHUNNED BECAUSE I AM A FOREIGNER’ Zoya Verzbitskaya, a 38-year-old Russian living in Tokyo’s Meguro Ward, said she was told by a dentist in May, “We can’t see a patient whose native language is not Japanese.” At that time, the COVID-19 situation in many European countries had rapidly deteriorated. Verzbitskaya, who studied Japanese literature at a graduate school in Japan and now works at a Japanese cosmetics company, said she thought the dentist “politely shunned me because I am a foreigner.” “I have peacefully lived as a member of Japanese society. But once the pandemic hit, I felt like society treated me as the ‘other,’” she said. At a discussion held by the government’s panel in September, some experts expressed concerns that foreigners would likely become targets of prejudice and discrimination in the health crisis. Sandeep said he has heard about cases in Chiba Prefecture, where he works, in which medical staff have not given basic examinations to patients because they were not Japanese. The staff instead recommended that the patients go to a large hospital. He also noted that foreign nationals are afraid of losing their jobs if they contract the novel coronavirus. “If they are worried about being discriminated against and feel concerned about their lives, they are likely to hesitate to speak about any change in their health condition,” Sandeep said. “Even if their access to health care services is improved, it will not solve the problem.” An estimated 2.89 million foreign nationals lived in Japan as of the end of June 2020, a significant increase from around 1990. Chinese nationals lead the pack with 790,000, followed by 440,000 South Koreans and 420,000 Vietnamese. There were also 280,000 Filipinos, as well as 210,000 Brazilians, 100,000 Nepalese and 70,000 Indonesians.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14088798

0,COVID-19 state of emergency set for greater Tokyo until Feb. 7,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"January 7, 2021 at 18:57 JST"," With record-breaking numbers of new COVID-19 cases being reported in Tokyo and neighboring prefectures, the government on Jan. 7 declared a state of emergency, the second in 10 months. Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga in a news conference asked residents of Tokyo and the prefectures of Kanagawa, Chiba and Saitama to cooperate with the four major measures the government was emphasizing. “We decided to declare a state of emergency in order to restrain a further increase in COVID-19 infections,” Suga said. “I express my appreciation for the efforts of the public until now and would like to ask for their further cooperation.” He said it would be important to thoroughly implement the preventive measures, such as wearing face masks in public, refraining from unnecessary outings after 8 p.m. and having 70 percent of company employees work from home. The government task force that approved the state of emergency declaration also agreed to various measures to prevent a further spread of novel coronavirus infections, including the shortening of business hours, stricter restrictions on large events and additional calls for more company employees to work from home. The state of emergency was set for a month until Feb. 7. This was the second time a state of emergency was declared for the pandemic, following one approved in April 2020 for seven prefectures, including Tokyo and the three neighboring prefectures, that was later extended nationwide. Under the latest state of emergency, bars and restaurants in the four prefectures will be asked to close at 8 p.m. and halt sales of alcohol at 7 p.m. Theaters and amusement parks that draw large crowds will be requested to shutter at 8 p.m. The governors of the four prefectures are asking their residents to refrain from unnecessary outings after 8 p.m. Event restrictions will also be tightened, with venues only to fill half the number of seats, up to a maximum of 5,000 people, to prevent large crowds. However, kindergartens, schools and day care centers will remain open. The names of bars and restaurants that refuse to shorten their business hours will be publicly disclosed, sources said. The bars and restaurants that comply with prefectural governors’ requests to shorten business hours can receive a subsidy of 60,000 yen ($580) a day, up 20,000 yen from the current amount, according to government sources. In exchange for the larger daily payments to the cooperating establishments, separate programs to assist small businesses during the pandemic and subsidize rents will stop accepting applications on Jan. 15. One condition for lifting the state of emergency is easing the burden on hospitals. That means reducing the number of hospital beds needed for COVID-19 patients as well as new cases to a level equivalent to stage 3 of the government’s four-stage pandemic alert level. Stage 3 is the second-highest stage on the scale. If the situation does not appear to be improving and headed toward a stage 3, the government will consult its experts and then decide on extending the state of emergency.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14088825
0,COVID-19 found in bodies of 122 whose deaths police probed,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"January 7, 2021 at 18:39 JST"," A total of 122 of the people police have found dead in their homes or outdoors since the COVID-19 pandemic hit Japan early last year were infected with the novel coronavirus, the National Police Agency said. In December alone, 56 of the dead were found to have the virus. Though the virus may have killed the victims, the NPA said it was difficult to confirm it. Whenever a death is reported, police investigate the cause to determine if foul play was involved, with the exception of people who died of an illness while being treated by a doctor. Of the 122 bodies found infected with the virus, people in their 70s formed the largest group, at 39. They were followed by 23 people in their 60s, 22 in their 80s, 20 in their 50s and nine people in their 90s, according to the NPA. Six people were in their 40s, while two were in their 30s. There was one person whose date of birth was unknown. Thirty-six of the bodies were found in Tokyo, accounting for about one-third of the total deaths. Twenty-five deaths were confirmed in Osaka Prefecture, 11 in Hyogo Prefecture, nine in Kanagawa Prefecture and seven in Saitama Prefecture. The number of deaths jumped to 56 in December. Until then, less than 10 cases were confirmed infected with the virus each month through November after 21 such cases were logged in April. Fifty of the 56 who died in December died indoors, such as at home or nursing homes or in other types of accommodations. Six were found outdoors, including on the street. Eighteen of the 56 were known to be infected with the virus before they died. The virus was confirmed in the remaining 38 people after their deaths when police, suspecting the victims had the virus, had the bodies undergo diagnostic tests. Medical experts say people infected with the coronavirus are prone to develop blood clots. “It's possible that some people died of a stroke or heart attack triggered by the development of a blood clot shortly after contracting the virus,” said Yasutaka Mizuno, a doctor specializing in infectious diseases at Global Healthcare Clinic in Tokyo. He recommended that patients with cardiovascular conditions or who are obese be hospitalized even if they only exhibit mild symptoms at first because they are at a higher risk of developing blood clots. He also underlined the importance of access to intensive care facilities and ventilators, as some patients might experience a sudden deterioration in their ability to breathe. As new cases surge in Tokyo, hundreds of infected people with mild symptoms have been forced to self-isolate at home or in a hotel as hospital beds, already filled with patients, were not available for them. Mizuno said efforts should be made to maintain the health care system in which clinics and large hospitals with sophisticated medical equipment do their part in dealing with the public health crisis. “It is vital for the infected to be able to promptly receive treatment at a leading hospital in their area when their condition abruptly takes a turn for the worse,” he said. “To ensure that, primary care doctors should provide care to patients who have mild cases.”",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14088861
0,"Tokyo state of emergency might last 2 months or more, expert says",['By AKIYOSHI ABE/ Staff Writer'],"January 7, 2021 at 17:24 JST"," Tokyo will need a stricter state of emergency to stop its explosion of daily COVID-19 cases t han the one-month measure to be declared on Jan. 7, a theoretical epidemiology expert warned. “It will likely take more than two months to sufficiently reduce the number of new cases,” said Hiroshi Nishiura, a professor of theoretical epidemiology who has previously issued ominous predictions over the possible course of the COVID-19 pandemic. The capital's new cases will remain unchanged if the state of emergency, to be declared by Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga, merely asks bars and restaurants to shorten operating hours, the primary focus of the measures now being pushed by the Suga Cabinet, Nishiura said. Tokyo's new daily cases of the virus will top 3,500 by the end of February and double to more than 7,000 by late March if strong measures to prevent a spread of infections are not implemented, he said. Nishiura's comments were based on the results of simulation he ran of various scenarios regarding fresh COVID-19 cases in the capital depending on what measures were implemented to stop them. The simulation also showed that Tokyo's average number of new cases could be reduced to under 100 by late February if effects emerge similar to what resulted after the first state of emergency was declared in April 2020. Nishiura added that the one-month period for the second state of emergency could be shortened “if indoor contact among people was reduced without compromise.” Though Nishiura is not a member of the health ministry advisory panel regarding the novel coronavirus pandemic, its chairman asked him to submit the simulation report to the panel's Jan. 6 meeting. A main point of the simulation is the so-called effective reproduction number, which shows how many people a COVID-19 patient has infected. If the number falls under 1, it means new infections have stopped spreading. But the data for Tokyo since Dec. 16 is an average 1.1. The government panel of experts on Jan. 5 came out with a list of recommended measures to prevent the virus from spreading further, including having bars and restaurants shorten business hours, asking residents to refrain from unnecessary outings, asking more company employees to work from home and strengthening restrictions on large events. Under Nishiura’s simulation, if the effective reproduction number was reduced to about 0.7, the number of new cases in Tokyo would fall to under 300 in a month’s time and to under 50 after two months. Nishiura said if the panel’s recommendations were sufficiently implemented achieving the 0.7 figure was not out of the question. But he said only focusing on shortening business hours for bars and restaurants would lead to a reduction of about 10 percent in the effective reproduction number. In that case, the number of new cases would remain unchanged. He added that the success of the recommended measures would depend on the extent of cooperation by the public. “There is no telling how effective measures based on simple requests will be until those measures are actually implemented,” Nishiura said. “We are at a stage where the communications skills of political leaders will become vital.” As of Dec. 19, the effective reproduction number for the greater Tokyo metropolitan area was 1.14, meaning new infections were spreading in a wider area. The number was 0.9 in Hokkaido, 1.15 in the Tohoku region, 1.07 in the Chukyo region centered on Nagoya, 0.98 in the Kansai region, 1.12 in northern Kyushu, and 1.31 in Okinawa Prefecture. Nishiura was formerly on a health ministry panel which in April 2020 said up to 420,000 people in Japan could die of COVID-19 if social distancing and other measures to prevent novel coronavirus infections were not followed.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14088536

A health ministry expert panel made a fresh plea for prompt measures to slow the spread of the disease at a Jan. 6 news conference following a meeting earlier the day. It said the current state of infections in Japan is at “a record level.” The experts said increases in new coronavirus cases have jeopardized hospital treatment for patients with illnesses other than COVID-19, not just in the Tokyo metropolitan area, but also in the heavily populated Chubu and Kansai regions. Data presented to the meeting showed that in the capital, public health centers could not find a hospital or a facility for isolation for more than 1,500 COVID-19 patients over the week from Dec. 20 to Dec. 26. The number more than doubled in the following week. “In some cases, infected people in long-term care facilities could not be moved to a hospital” because medical facilities were inundated with patients, Takaji Wakita, director-general of the National Institute of Infectious Diseases who heads the panel, said. Hospital beds are quickly filling up and workers at public health centers and hospitals are overstretched in dealing with the spike in new COVID-19 cases over the past weeks, according to experts. The national tally of new cases reached 24,667 over the week through Jan. 4, with Tokyo accounting for about 25 percent of the total. The ratio jumped to half when the figure for the capital was combined with those of neighboring Kanagawa, Saitama and Chiba prefectures. The effective reproduction number, which is how many people one person with COVID-19 will infect, was 1.09 as of Dec. 19. As of Jan. 4, 74.9 percent of hospital beds secured for a peak in the pandemic were occupied in Tokyo. The comparable figure was 70.6 percent in Aichi Prefecture, 68.3 percent in Hyogo Prefecture, 67.0 percent in Osaka Prefecture, and 66.3 percent in Saitama Prefecture.

It was the third time the daily count has exceeded 1,000 in Tokyo. With the 1,228 new cases on Jan. 5 and the previous record of 1,337 reported on Dec. 31, the daily average for the week broke the 1,000 level and reached 1,072. The previous nationwide record was 4,917 set on Jan. 5. Aichi Prefecture’s record number of 364 new COVID-19 cases on Jan. 6 prompted Governor Hideaki Omura to consider asking the government to issue a state of emergency for his central Japan prefecture. A record high was also set in Hyogo Prefecture, which reported 248 new infections, the second straight day the count has exceeded 200. Nagano Prefecture confirmed 50 new cases for a second consecutive daily high. Mie Prefecture’s 33 new cases also broke its record set the previous day. Oita Prefecture matched its single-day high of 26 confirmed infections. The figure for Tokyo was particularly troubling for its health care system because it came day after the number of inpatients with the disease in the capital topped 3,000 for the first time. As of Jan. 5, the number of COVID-19 inpatients was a record-high 3,025, with the occupancy rate of hospital beds hitting 86 percent. There were also 870 COVID-19 patients recuperating at accommodation facilities and 4,480 recovering at home, bringing the total to 8,375 patients in Tokyo. The number of patients listed in serious condition in the capital rose by two from the previous day to a record 113 on Jan. 6, metropolitan government officials said. The figure exceeded 105 set in late April last year under the first state of emergency. Tokyo defines serious cases as those requiring ventilators or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, also known as an ECMO lung bypass machine. A second state of emergency is expected to be declared this week for Tokyo and three surrounding prefectures. The situation in the capital is now worse than what it was under the first state of emergency. The Tokyo metropolitan government in December said it will increase the number of hospital beds for COVID-19 patients from 3,000 to 4,000. It currently has 3,500 beds, and nearly half of the 220 beds for patients with serious symptoms are occupied. “It is an extremely critical situation,” Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike said at a news conference on Jan. 4. Health care workers are growing frustrated over the dire situation. “Medical personnel are exhausted and worn out as they have continued to treat patients from the first wave,” Haruo Ozaki, head of the Tokyo Medical Association, said. “Reducing the number of new patients is the only way to get through this crisis, and we fear the medical capacity is strained to near the breaking point.” Of the 1,591 new cases in Tokyo on Jan. 6, 439 patients are in their 20s, followed by 326 in their 30s, 278 in their 40s, and 196 in their 50s. There were 179 patients aged 65 or older. From Dec. 1 to Jan. 1, the number of inpatients increased from 1,650 to 2,730 in Tokyo. At the peak of the first wave of virus infections, the total number of COVID-19 inpatients and patients at accommodation facilities and their homes in Tokyo was 2,974 as of May 6. But now, the number of inpatients alone has exceeded that mark.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14086264
0,Japan’s stagnant vaccine industry falls far behind in COVID-19 race,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"January 6, 2021 at 19:10 JST"," Japanese drug companies are moving at an “unprecedented” pace to develop COVID-19 vaccines, but their foreign rivals have already won the race. Although the government has committed hundreds of billions of yen for a game-changing medicine in the novel coronavirus pandemic, the domestic industry is just not set up for speedy vaccine development, and such projects have long been a low priority for Japanese pharmaceutical businesses. Japan plans to begin inoculating the population in late February at the earliest. As it does with so many pharmaceuticals, the country will rely on an import, the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. Meanwhile, there is no way to know when the home-grown vaccines will become available. Shionogi & Co., a major pharmaceutical company that is developing a COVID-19 vaccine with the National Institute of Infectious Diseases, among others, began a clinical trial involving more than 200 people in December. It plans to expand capacity to produce doses for 30 million people by the end of 2021. Unigen, a manufacturer of bio-pharmaceuticals, plans to have its factory in Ikeda, Gifu Prefecture, ready in spring to produce the anticipated vaccine developed by Shionogi at any time. For Shionogi, developing a vaccine while simultaneously arranging a production system is “unprecedented,” a public relations official of the company said. “Normally, we begin considering the production system when we are at the final phase of our clinical trials,” the official said. Anges Inc., a startup based in Osaka Prefecture, is a frontrunner in Japan in developing a COVID-19 vaccine. A clinical trial of its vaccine, developed with Osaka University, is expected to start by March, with 500 people taking part in the program. After that, Anges plans to conduct the final phase of its clinical trials overseas, involving tens of thousands of volunteers. Shionogi and Anges are the only Japanese drug companies that said they have reached the clinical-trial stage. But both companies have not disclosed when their vaccines can be brought to practical use. KM Biologics Co. plans to begin a clinical trial of its vaccine in January, while Daiichi Sankyo Co. and ID Pharma Co. expect to do so in March at the earliest. The government has decided to provide at least 317.7 billion yen ($2.93 billion)--60 billion yen for research and development and 257.7 billion yen for preparations of the production system--to help Japanese companies come up with vaccines for COVID-19. However, the domestic vaccine industry had long been stagnant well before the novel coronavirus outbreak struck the country last year. The Japanese vaccine market is worth about 140 billion yen, accounting for slightly more than 1 percent of the 10 trillion yen in overall sales of pharmaceutical products in Japan, according to the health ministry. In addition, more than half of the pharmaceutical products sold in Japan are imported. Vaccine development is a time-consuming and high-stakes undertaking for drug companies. It normally takes several years to develop a vaccine for practical use, and several more years are needed for the ministry to select the vaccine for periodic inoculations of the population. Companies have no idea if demand will remain for the vaccine by the time it is finally available for an infectious disease. A senior official with a Japanese drug maker said it is not realistic for a business to invest in creating a vaccine while shelving development of other drugs. “Even if you are fortunate to finally come up with a vaccine, you cannot halt its supply once the rollout begins due to social responsibility,” the official said. “It will be a huge burden for a pharmaceutical company to set aside manpower and production equipment for it in ordinary times.” Small and midsize players, as well as incorporated foundations, which are all limited in funds, have crowded the Japanese vaccine industry. In contrast, the vaccine markets overseas are dominated by a handful of pharmaceutical giants. These Japanese companies and foundations are tasked with producing existing vaccines that have steady demand in the domestic market. Under these circumstances, their ability to develop new vaccines has deteriorated over the years. Concerned about the situation, the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare in 2007 published a future vision for the industry, calling on longtime players in the vaccine industry and large drug makers to join hands to better compete globally. One positive development was a joint venture established by Daiichi Sankyo and the Kitasato Institute, a research body specializing in medicine and biology. Overall, however, the ministry’s push has yet to lead to any meaningful transformation of the industry. “The business climate is still tough for the vaccine industry and no promising players have emerged,” said an official with a separate pharmaceutical company. The official said Japan would have been left in a serious situation if the U.S. side had not agreed to provide a COVID-19 vaccine. In terms of national security, the need is growing for Japanese companies to be able to roll out a domestically produced vaccine, according to Masayuki Imagawa, head of the Japan Vaccine Business Unit of Takeda Pharmaceutical Co. “The world may be struck by another pandemic in the near future,” he said. “The coronavirus pandemic should be a catalyst for Japan to contemplate a system for vaccine development by the private sector, academia and government.” (This story was written by Sho Ito, Eisuke Eguchi and Takao Shinkai.)",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14086012
0,Virus cases in greater Tokyo now at ‘explosive growth’ level,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"January 6, 2021 at 18:34 JST"," The greater Tokyo metropolitan area faces an “explosive growth” in novel coronavirus infections, which will likely require more than a month to contain even under a state of emergency, experts said. The gloomy assessment came as the government’s expert panel on the COVID-19 pandemic released a list of recommendations Jan. 5 regarding a second state of emergency set to be issued for Tokyo and neighboring Kanagawa, Saitama and Chiba prefectures at the behest of governors following a surge in cases. The daily number of new infections rose to 4,917 nationwide as of 11:30 p.m. on Jan. 5., breaking the previous record of 4,520 reported on Dec. 31. In its recommendations, the panel called on people to be extra vigilant in protecting themselves against infection, especially if dining out. The panel urged people to refrain from going out unless absolutely necessary. It also recommended using takeout services and strictly avoiding drinking parties at universities and workplaces. Shigeru Omi, who heads the panel, said at a news conference that the greater Tokyo metropolitan area is at the equivalent of the highest level of infections, known as stage 4. That means the region is seeing an “explosive growth” in new cases. Bringing the situation down to around the stage 3 level is “not a goal,” the panel cautioned, adding that the spread of the virus should be curbed to the equivalent of stage 2 or lower even after the latest state of emergency, the second since last April, is lifted. Under the panel’s four-stage classification, areas in stage 3 are in the grip of a sharp increase in new infections while those in stage 2 see a gradual increase in fresh cases. Omi said it would be “extremely difficult” to contain the spread of infections in the greater Tokyo metropolitan area to around the stage 3 level in less than a month even if the state of emergency is issued this week, as expected. He also stressed the importance of taking anti-virus measures because “the current infection situation cannot be brought under control” with only eating and drinking establishments taking precautions against infections.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14085899
1,Kirin beer executive questions sweeping shutdowns of late-night bars,['REUTERS'],"January 6, 2021 at 17:45 JST"," The head of Kirin Holdings’ beer business on Wednesday questioned imposing across-the-board closings of late-night bars and restaurants around Tokyo, saying some establishments had already implemented stringent safety measures. Japanese government advisers on Tuesday called for a new state of emergency in the Tokyo area as daily COVID-19 cases on Tuesday hit 1,278, the second highest daily total since the pandemic began. Residents are expected to be urged to refrain from non-essential outings after 8 p.m., and bars and restaurants will be asked to close by that time. “We don’t yet know the specifics of the new state of emergency... but I do somewhat question taking a sweeping approach, when there are establishments which have taken very strict measures to prevent virus transmissions,” Takayuki Fuse, head of Kirin Brewery Company. Fuse said Kirin would accept any government decision, but added that he was deeply concerned about the impact of a second lockdown on the industry and jobs. “The restaurant and bar industry is estimated to be worth 26 trillion yen, supporting the jobs of over 4 million people,” he said during a presentation to investors outlining the brewer’s strategy for the year. Kirin and Asahi Group Holdings have been in a tight race for the top spot in Japanese beer sales. Kirin’s beer sales fell 18.6 percent in Japan last year as the coronavirus discouraged gathering at bars and restaurants. It said on Wednesday that it was targeting a 17.2 percent rebound in 2021.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14085952
1,Opposition balks at punishing noncompliance in pandemic fight,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"January 6, 2021 at 17:20 JST"," Opposition parties objected to proposals to punish companies that refuse to cooperate with anti-pandemic measures, a dispute that could delay legal revisions on combating the latest surge in novel coronavirus infections. The government plans to submit legislation to revise the special measures law on dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic as soon as the ordinary Diet session opens on Jan. 18. The revised law would, among other things, spell out support measures for businesses struggling to ride out the health crisis. But a major sticking point brought up at Jan. 5 discussions between government officials and lawmakers was whether to include provisions in the revised law that would criminally penalize businesses that do not comply with governors’ request to shorten business hours. Ruling coalition lawmakers were generally in favor of such punitive measures. “It will be important to have measures with a certain level of binding authority,” Hiroshige Seko, the secretary-general of the Upper House caucus of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, said. “It would be meaningless to revise the law without such measures.” Opposition lawmakers, however, said priority should be placed on providing adequate support to the businesses so they will be more likely to cooperate with the governors’ requests. Kenta Izumi, policy chief of the opposition Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan (CDP), said that even if penalty provisions were included, they should only be administrative measures or fines, rather than criminal penalties. The Japanese Communist Party said it was opposed to any form of punishment against noncompliant companies. There were also slight differences in the kind of support given to businesses that cooperate with the requests. The ruling coalition was leaning toward an across-the-board grant, much like past measures taken to help businesses survive the pandemic. But the CDP is proposing that compensation amounts vary depending on the scale of the business operation. It is also calling for support to businesses that supply bars and restaurants with produce and drinks. Another meeting is scheduled for Jan. 8 during which government officials will respond to the requests from the lawmakers. The goal of future discussions will be achieving a balance between support and penalties for businesses affected by the governors’ requests. The government wants to pass the revision bill by early February. And given the continuing surge in novel coronavirus infections around the country, both sides recognize the urgency of revising the law. “We do not want the legislation to be a divisive one,” Jun Azumi, the chairman of the CDP’s Diet Affairs Committee, said on Jan. 5. The government is also discussing various measures to give prefectural governors greater authority to ensure their early closure requests to bars and restaurants have some bite. Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga is expected to declare a state of emergency for Tokyo and three neighboring prefectures on Jan. 7. The four governors will then call on bars and restaurants to shorten their business hours, especially if they serve alcohol. To ensure compliance, the central government is considering revisions to relevant Cabinet orders to give the governors the authority to reveal the names of businesses that are not cooperating with the requests. As an incentive to cooperate, compliant businesses could receive additional government grants. Government officials are continuing with discussions to determine what types of bars and restaurants will be covered under the revised Cabinet orders. Once that is decided, the Cabinet will approve the revisions. (This article was compiled from reports by Ayako Nakada, Takahiro Okubo and Sachiko Miwa.)",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14085817

1,Suga: State of emergency for Tokyo area could start on Jan. 7,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"January 5, 2021 at 18:52 JST"," Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga on Jan. 5 said a monthlong state of emergency will be declared for the greater Tokyo area starting Jan. 7 at the earliest, mainly targeting operations of bars and restaurants. But the government is not expected to ask elementary, junior high schools and high schools to close in Tokyo and the neighboring prefectures of Kanagawa, Saitama and Chiba. The government also will not impose a blanket ban on concerts and sports events in those areas. However, under the state of emergency, the local governments could ask organizers to tighten conditions for such events by, for example, significantly reducing audience sizes. Suga explained the government’s state of emergency plan at a meeting of senior officials with the ruling Liberal Democratic Party. He said the government will summon a panel of infectious disease experts on Jan. 7 to seek its opinion of the plan. The declaration is expected to come by the end of Jan. 7 after the plan is reported to the Diet and details, such as duration and specific measures, are confirmed. The state of emergency, the second after one was issued in April 2020, falls under the special measures law on battling the novel coronavirus. The law gives the prime minister and the government greater authority to deal directly with the pandemic. Once the declaration is issued, governors in the affected areas will have a legal basis to order restaurants to cut their operating hours and tell residents to avoid going out for nonessential reasons. The government and prefectural authorities are hoping that a new state of emergency will again heighten a sense of vigilance against infections as the third wave of COVID-19 continues to spread around the country. Tokyo and the three prefectures have already decided to ask all restaurants to close at 8 p.m. until the end of January and will request companies to take anti-virus measures, such as urging more employees to work from home. In addition to restricting attendance at music or sports events, governors under the state of emergency will have the authority to halt the use of schools and other public facilities. The governors can issue orders to noncompliant operators and publish their names. However, the special measures law in its current form has no clause authorizing punishment against defiant operators. The government is working on a revision bill that will allow authorities to provide relief assistance to businesses that comply with requests to reduce their operating hours or temporarily shut down, as well as to punish those that refuse to cooperate. The Suga administration, with the cooperation of opposition parties, plans to pass the bill as early as possible after the ordinary Diet session convenes on Jan. 18. Suga ruled out the option of asking for school closures during his appearance on a news program broadcast by Fuji Television Network Inc. on the night of Jan. 4. The education ministry is also set to give the standardized university admission examination on Jan. 16-17 and Jan. 30-31 as scheduled, regardless of the declaration of a state of emergency. The declaration is intended mainly to restrict operating hours of restaurants, according to senior government officials. At a news conference on Jan. 4, Suga referred to an analysis by medical experts and cited the need for “reducing risks of infections at settings of eating and drinking” in the Tokyo metropolitan area. The prime minister said crowd sizes in the entertainment districts there did not decline last month, despite requests from local authorities. Tokyo reported a record 1,337 new COVID-19 cases on Dec. 31. The nearby prefectures have also reported surges in new infections. The previous state of emergency was declared on April 7 for Tokyo and six prefectures and later covered the rest of Japan on April 16. It was lifted for some prefectures in May, and then for the last group of Tokyo, Hokkaido, Saitama, Chiba and Kanagawa prefectures on May 25. The new monthlong state of emergency for the capital and the three surrounding prefectures will certainly have a negative effect on the Japanese economy, but not as much as the first one. The expected declaration will shrink Japan’s gross domestic product in real terms by 3.8 trillion yen ($36.9 billion), mainly in personal consumption, according to an estimate by SMBC Nikko Securities. The figure would be one-fifth of the 18.6-trillion-yen contraction in GDP during the first state of emergency, the brokerage added.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14083334

The stance taken by Osaka, Aichi and Fukuoka prefectures was in sharp contrast to that taken by the governors of Tokyo, Kanagawa, Saitama and Chiba prefectures. They recently asked the central government to issue a new state of emergency following a spike in COVID-19 cases in their areas over the year-end and New Year break. Novel coronavirus infections also spread rapidly outside the greater Tokyo metropolitan area during the period, but Osaka, Aichi and Fukuoka prefectures do not intend to follow suit with Tokyo and the three neighboring prefectures, at least not yet. Osaka Governor Hirofumi Yoshimura explained Jan. 4 he will not ask the central government to issue a state of emergency for his prefecture as the rise in new cases is not as sharp as that for the greater Tokyo metropolitan area. However, he said he will urge residents of Osaka to refrain from traveling between the prefecture and areas to be covered by a state of emergency because “a surge in infections could occur at any moment.” The daily number of new infections in Osaka has been dropping slightly, although it reported a record 171 serious cases on Jan. 4. The occupancy rate of hospital beds available for immediate use for COVID-19 patients in the prefecture also remains high with 82.2 percent of the 208 beds already taken. Aichi Governor Hideaki Omura said at a Jan. 4 news conference his prefecture is “not in a situation that requires a request for a state of emergency at this point.” Aichi’s daily number of new COVID-19 cases hit 294 on Dec. 30 but has remained below the 200 mark since Jan. 1. “The level of infections in Aichi Prefecture differs from that of the greater Tokyo metropolitan area,” Omura said. The governor also said he will consider extending a request for bars and restaurants that serve alcohol to close early. That measure is due to expire on Jan. 11. Fukuoka in Kyushu, southern Japan, confirmed 189 new infections on Dec. 30 and 190 on Dec. 31, marking the second straight daily record. The rate of positive test results topped 13 percent in the prefecture on Jan. 1, indicating that community infections are widespread. But Fukuoka has not requested the central government to declare a state of emergency for the prefecture. “Our prefecture is not in a situation that calls for a request for a state of emergency based on a comprehensive assessment of the current state of the health care system and the necessity to put a brake on social and economic activities,” a prefectural government official said Jan. 4.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14083357
1,Governors in greater Tokyo to ask all eateries to close at 8 p.m.,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"January 5, 2021 at 17:10 JST"," The governors of Tokyo, Saitama, Kanagawa and Chiba prefectures on Jan. 4 decided to ask all restaurants to close at 8 p.m. from Jan. 12 to 31, drawing groans from businesses struggling to survive the pandemic. At an online meeting in the evening, the four governors also agreed to urge residents to stay home after 8 p.m. from Jan. 8 to 31, unless an outing is urgent and necessary. They will also ask businesses in their jurisdictions to take anti-virus measures, such as promoting telework among their employees. Restaurants and bars that serve alcohol in Tokyo and the surrounding areas are currently asked to close at 10 p.m. But the ongoing surge of novel coronavirus infections has prompted the local leaders to ask them to close two hours earlier from Jan. 8 until the end of the month. The early closure request for the Jan. 12 to 31 period covers all types of restaurants, regardless of whether they offer alcoholic beverages. A man in his 40s who owns a dining bar in Tokyo’s Jinbocho district said the new request “is going to be the final blow.” “I will probably close the shutters for good,” he said about the 8 p.m. closure request, looking at his empty 36-seat restaurant on the night of Jan. 4. He said his business lost most of its customers in December, when the number of new COVID-19 cases in the capital continued to rise, and the 36-seat restaurant has remained empty on some nights. The owner said he has complied each time the government issued a request to close early. “But it has reached the limit. I want the government to offer full support,” he said. Businesses that comply with the new request will be paid a subsidy. The amount will be determined after the local governments discuss the matter with the central government. The four governors asked the central government to declare a state of emergency for the greater Tokyo area to contain the virus. Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga on Jan. 4 said he will give it consideration, although he is expected to issue the declaration this week. But the governors did not wait for Suga to make a decision and declared their own “state of emergency action” at the online meeting. They emphasized the importance of “getting a head start on reducing the flow of people in the areas around Tokyo.” The new requests will exclude islands under the jurisdiction of the Tokyo metropolitan government. Kanagawa, Saitama and Chiba prefectural governments will expand the targeted areas starting from Jan. 12. The action plan calls on companies to ask employees to refrain from holding dinner parties, among other things. It also sets numerical targets for teleworking. In Tokyo, businesses will be asked to have more than 60 percent of their employees involved in teleworking on three days a week. In Kanagawa Prefecture, businesses will be asked to have 50 percent of their employees work from home. In Chiba Prefecture, the requested ratio is 60 percent, and in Saitama Prefecture, the goal is 50 percent. “It is necessary not only for each resident to make an effort to lower the risk of infection but also to thoroughly curtail close contact and the flow of people,” Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike said at a news conference after the meeting. Kei Takeuchi, who manages Kanda Burajiru, a long-established coffee shop in Tokyo’s Chiyoda Ward, said he will comply with the request and close early. “With this many new infection cases, there is no choice,” Takeuchi, 49, said. But like others in the services industry, he is worried about the long-term impact on his business. “Many customers will think that restaurants are dangerous,” he said. “Once customers stop coming, it takes time to bring them back.” A 35-year-old woman who works at an insurance company in Tokyo’s Marunouchi district said the state of emergency is necessary, but she worries about its impact on the economy. She also noted that bars and restaurants are not the only places where people gather. She said she canceled her plans for a New Year’s visit to a neighborhood shrine because there were too many people there. Requesting restaurants and bars to close early “is not enough to stop the movement of people,” she said. “I want (the government) to take measures before the health care system collapses.”",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14083211

The move comes as the government is expected to declare a second state of emergency to curb spiraling cases of COVID-19. The latest measure will effectively ban entry of almost all foreign arrivals. The government initially planned to suspend relaxed entry restrictions for the 11 areas on a case-by-case basis if the new variant of the coronavirus was confirmed. “We will halt the eased measures immediately if we find the new variant in those partner countries,” Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga said at a news conference on the morning of Jan. 4. But ruling and opposition party lawmakers opposed such a loose step, so Suga changed the policy. The government is considering the duration of the suspension, which will take effect at least during the period under the state of emergency expected to be declared any day now, official sources said. Entry of business travelers, students and technical intern trainees from 11 nations and regions, such as China, South Korea, Vietnam, Singapore, Thailand and Taiwan, is currently permitted under certain conditions.

1,Japan moving to retract favorable entry treatment for 11 nations,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"January 2, 2021 at 15:55 JST"," Japan is considering retracting preferential treatment for nationals of 11 nations where COVID-19 cases are comparatively under control. The favored treatment for short-term business travel as well as longer term foreign students and technical intern trainees would be withdrawn if any of the nations registers an increase in the spread of new strains of the novel coronavirus in their local communities, according to several government sources. The 11 nations include China and South Korea. As mutual preferential treatment had been agreed to through negotiations, any move to withdraw those steps would also involve further negotiations. The measure for short-term business travelers involves China, South Korea, Vietnam and Singapore. Business travelers from those nations are not required to self-isolate for two weeks after arriving in Japan. Students and technical intern trainees from 11 nations have been allowed entry since July, but they are required to self-quarantine for two weeks after their arrival. The government also relaxed entry restrictions for all nations with regard to medium- to long-term stays. But that measure was withdrawn for Britain and South Africa in late December after new strains of the coronavirus were found to be spreading there. The retraction of relaxed entry applied to all nations as of Dec. 28. The global norm has been to tighten entry from nations where COVID-19 cases are spreading. Most arriving passengers from nations where infections are spreading have been returning Japanese nationals. Those trends led some in the government to argue there was no need to retract the relaxed entry restrictions for all countries. But the Suga administration opted for tightened entry. Members of the ruling coalition as well as opposition parties criticized the step because arrivals were still approved for nationals from China and South Korea. According to the Immigration Services Agency, there were about 3,830 arrivals under the preferential treatment program from China, about 3,390 from Vietnam and about 340 from South Korea in the one-week period from Dec. 14. A new strain of the coronavirus was detected by quarantine officers at an airport in South Korea, but it has not yet spread into the community there, according to Foreign Ministry sources.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14077149

Over the same period, Tokyo reported 17,908 new cases, the most in the nation, but its death toll from the novel coronavirus was 133. By prefecture, Osaka Prefecture’s death toll was second only to Hokkaido’s 254 in December. The fatality rate in Osaka Prefecture in the third wave of infections was 1.7 percent as of Dec. 23, up 0.2 percentage points from the rate during the second wave in the summer. Osaka Prefecture’s increase in deaths may stem from elderly people accounting for a significant ratio of those newly infected, as well as its large number of nursing care facilities, where cluster infections have occurred. People in their 70s or older accounted for 90 percent of the COVID-19 deaths in December in Osaka Prefecture. Elderly people are at a higher risk of developing serious symptoms once infected with the virus. Between Nov. 29 and Dec. 24, 1,837 patients in their 60s and 70s accounted for 21.7 percent of all people newly infected.

1,Hata’s death puts pre-existing conditions under the spotlight,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"December 29, 2020 at 18:29 JST"," The sudden and shocking death of Upper House member Yuichiro Hata has put on display the dangers of COVID-19 to those with pre-existing medical conditions. Hata, 53, a former transport minister, died on Dec. 27. An autopsy determined the cause of death was complications from COVID-19. He had suffered from diabetes, high cholesterol and high blood pressure. While the fatality rate for those in their 50s who contract COVID-19 is only 0.3 percent, a study by the Tokyo metropolitan government into COVID-19-related deaths found that 87.5 percent of those in their 50s who died as of Dec. 8 had a pre-existing condition. Hata's condition at first prompted some concern but grew grave in a very short period of time. One of Hata’s aides contacted the medical clinic in the Diet building on Dec. 24 after someone close to the Upper House member tested positive for the novel coronavirus, a ccording to Tetsuro Fukuyama, secretary-general of the opposition Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan, to which Hata belonged. The aide asked for the names of medical institutions where Hata could take a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test. At that time, he showed no symptoms. But late on Dec. 24, Hata developed a fever of 38.6 degrees and the following day made an appointment for a PCR test at a Tokyo medical institution for 3:45 p.m. on Dec. 27. His temperature swung up and down in the lead up to the appointment. Hata’s fever dropped to 36.5 degrees on the morning of Dec. 25, but that night it rose again to 38.3 degrees. The following day, his fever was 37.5 degrees in the morning and 38.2 degrees at night. On the morning of Dec. 27, his fever had again fallen to 36.1 degrees. Hata rested at home on Dec. 25 and 26. An aide picked Hata up to take him to his PCR test the following day, but his condition suddenly worsened as they drove to the medical institution. Hata’s breathing became labored. After he said, “I may have pneumonia,” the conversation stopped. The aide realized something was seriously wrong and called for an ambulance. Hata was taken to the University of Tokyo Hospital where he was pronounced dead at 4:34 p.m.--nearly an hour after he was scheduled to take the PCR test. On Dec. 22, before he developed any symptoms, Hata attended a meeting with CDP executives in the Diet building. The following day, he traveled to Nagano Prefecture, which he represented, to meet with officials from the party’s prefectural branch. He also held a news conference before returning to Tokyo that day for a meeting with Finance Ministry officials. CDP officials have contacted those who met with Hata over those two days and requested they take a PCR or antigen test.

Despite government requests for alcohol-serving businesses to shorten their hours and for residents to avoid travel, the daily numbers continue to climb. In fact, the latest tally represented the 15th straight record high for the day of the week in Tokyo.

1,Parties agree to move up Diet talks on revising COVID-19 law,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"December 29, 2020 at 15:29 JST"," The growing health crisis led to a rare agreement between the ruling coalition and opposition camp to start immediate Diet deliberations on revising the special measures law for dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic. Normally, such legislation is discussed in April, after the budget proposal for the coming fiscal year is approved by the Diet. But on Dec. 28, Hiroshi Moriyama, the Diet Affairs Committee chairman of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, and Jun Azumi, his counterpart in the opposition Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan, agreed that discussions on revising the special measures law should start almost as soon as the ordinary Diet session convenes on Jan. 18. Azumi told Moriyama that the opposition was willing to deliberate the budget in parallel with the revision bill. The ruling coalition wants to pass the revision bill before the end of January after gaining the opposition’s backing of support measures to help businesses that comply with local government requests to shorten business hours or temporarily close their doors. Moriyama and Azumi also agreed to hold a meeting on either Jan. 5 or 6 to give both sides the opportunity to express their views on the revisions to government officials. “We would miss the right timing if we stuck to established practice and waited until after April once the budget was passed” to deliberate revising the special measures law, Azumi told reporters after his meeting with Moriyama. Government officials are considering writing into the special measures law various support measures for the cooperating businesses, as well as penalties against businesses that refuse requests from prefectural governors to temporarily close or shorten operating hours. Azumi, however, expressed some hesitation about including punishments for noncompliance. “There is no need for strong penalties,” he said. “I believe the fundamental way of thinking should be to encourage (cooperation) by providing sufficient support measures.” A number of governors around Japan have urged businesses that serve alcohol to close up early as the surge in novel coronavirus infections is straining medical facilities, particularly in densely populated areas, like Tokyo. Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga on Dec. 28 again called on the public to take various measures to prevent a further spreading of COVID-19, saying at a government task force meeting that the “virus will not take time off during the year-end and New Year period.” Suga also announced a temporary suspension of eased entry restrictions for medium- and long-term foreign visitors from all nations. He said efforts would be made to allow for around-the-clock testing for COVID-19 as well as medical care throughout the year-end and New Year period.

Hospitals operate with far fewer staff than usual during the holiday period and may be further sapped by treating a rising number of COVID-19 cases. The ministry asked phone consultation services that offer information about where people can get tested or treated for COVID-19 to remain operating around the clock during the holiday season i n a directive sent to prefectural governments dated Dec. 2. The governments are also encouraged to consider increasing the number of staff and telephone lines to boost the phone services' capacity if necessary. In areas experiencing a surge in COVID-19 cases, patients with mild or no symptoms whom doctors deem don't require hospitalization will be asked to recuperate at accommodation facilities or at home to prevent hospital beds from filling up. The ministry is also urging private testing labs that test samples sent by medical institutions to continue providing the service throughout the holiday period. People with symptoms such as a fever or cough should check which medical services are available to them on their local prefectural medical association’s website as services may vary among prefectural governments and municipalities. Patients with those symptoms are normally advised to first call their family doctors. If the patients do not have family doctors or if their clinics are closed for the day, they can call phone consultation centers set up by local governments. The centers will then give patients phone numbers of medical institutions that are open in their neighborhoods so that they can call them prior to visiting in person. A list of each prefecture's phone consultation service information on the novel coronavirus is also being posted on the ministry's website.

There have been cases reported in Japan of the fast-spreading variant, which has hit countries such as Britain and South Africa, sparking fresh alarm. The entry ban could last beyond the initially envisaged period, depending on the proliferation of the new variants, government sources said. Prior to the suspension that will take effect on Dec. 28, Japan had eased its entry ban to allow international visitors to enter the country for mid- or long-term stays on condition that they self-isolate for two weeks. After the discovery of more transmissible variants of the virus, entry of those new visitors entering the country on business or nonbusiness purposes will be suspended. In addition, Japanese nationals and foreign residents in Japan returning from overseas trips must self-isolate for two weeks after entering Japan, as was required before November. Starting from Dec. 30, Japanese nationals returning from countries where the variant coronavirus was found will be asked to present a certificate stating that they are confirmed free of the virus within 72 hours before departure. Business travel between Japan and 11 countries and regions, including China and South Korea where the virus is relatively contained, will remain intact.

Ministry officials are keen to ensure that those in need of help do not hesitate to apply before their situation becomes a matter of life or death. The welfare ministry’s website has posted numerous messages calling on those in financial distress to apply right away. Groups dedicated to supporting those in need also took up the banner by sending out messages over social media from the evening of Dec. 25 urging those requiring public assistance to apply for it. A new section of the welfare ministry’s website was set up from Dec. 22 to urge people to consult with their nearest social welfare office if they need public assistance. It aims to dispel a commonly held misunderstanding and explain that applications can be made without consulting with relatives the individuals do not live with. The page also states that those without a fixed address or even those who own their own homes can still apply. Internet ads taken out by the welfare ministry contain similar messages. The welfare ministry has waged a publicity blitz on the issue of public assistance since summer by distributing, for example, a pamphlet on livelihood support measures that explains public assistance is a right available to all citizens. Even so, many people remain hesitant about applying for government help due to ingrained prejudice and misunderstanding toward those on the dole. “We want to link up the appropriate support measures to those who need it as quickly as possible before the situation becomes a truly pressing one,” said a ministry official in charge of the issue. Tsuyoshi Inaba, who heads Tsukuroi Tokyo Fund, an organization that supports those in economic distress, discovered the welfare ministry page on Dec. 23 and tweeted: “The Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare has finally become very serious about this issue. We heartily welcome this move.” According to Inaba, many of those who consulted with his group since the pandemic began are aged in their 20s to 40s. He noted that even if they only have a few hundred yen in their pockets, some still refuse to apply for public assistance. For most local government offices, Dec. 28 will be the last business day this year until Jan. 3. Inaba, worried that some people may fall through the safety net, called on like-minded groups Dec. 25 to also send out tweets encouraging those hesitating to seek public assistance to apply immediately. A deluge of tweets swept social networking sites between 6 p.m. and 9 p.m. on Dec. 25. “We wanted to appeal to the younger generation who are more familiar with social media in order to create the mood in society that public assistance is a program that anyone can use,” Inaba said. Welfare ministry officials reported a 1.8-percent increase in public assistance applications in September over the same month a year ago.

The first days of the new year always see many millions visiting temples and shrines to make wishes for the year ahead. Suga used the opportunity to again apologize for attending dinner parties at a time when the government is calling on the public to avoid gatherings of more than five people at a time. He also announced that stricter measures are being taken against arriving passengers from South Africa after a new strain of the novel coronavirus was detected there. He said that about 270 billion yen ($2.6 billion) from a government reserve fund would be set aside to ensure there are sufficient hospital beds to treat COVID-19 patients. Turning to other steps, Suga said the government and ruling coalition would work on revising the special measures law to deal with the pandemic during the ordinary Diet session set to convene in January. But he did not state dates for submitting the relevant legislation or when it would pass. Suga also apologized for the manner in which the Go To Travel tourism promotion campaign was abruptly temporarily suspended due to the spread of COVID-19 cases. “Some of the explanations given to the public were insufficient,” Suga said. “In the future, I will make every effort to be more thorough in the way I communicate.” Among measures to be considered for revising the special measures law is the inclusion of penalties against businesses that did not comply with local government requests to shorten their business hours, but Suga again indicated he was not thinking about declaring another state of emergency. Asked if he really thought it would be possible to change the public's mind-set without such a state of emergency declaration, Suga said, “I believe the public will show understanding if we provide a thorough explanation at every opportunity given to us.” And while he frowned at the continuing trend of people going out, Suga only said it was up to local governors to move up calls for shorter business hours. Shigeru Omi, the chairman of the government panel of experts dealing with the health scare who accompanied Suga at the news conference, cited inadequate measures aimed at bars and restaurants where large numbers of people gather as a key reason for the continuing spread of cases. Omi also said there was a very high possibility of another surge once the New Year holiday period is over and people resume their economic and social activities. The same day, two Cabinet ministers apologized for gatherings that exceeded the limit called for by government officials. Defense Minister Nobuo Kishi said that the two top officers of the Maritime Self-Defense Force who subsequently tested positive for COVID-19 attended a send-off party on Dec. 16 that involved food and drinks for 14 people. Four of the participants later tested positive for COVID-19. Also on Dec. 25, Seiko Hashimoto, the state minister for the Tokyo Olympic and Paralympic Games, apologized for having dinner at a sushi restaurant in Tokyo on Dec. 17 with five others.

0,Suga slammed for ‘lowballing’ Britain arrival numbers in gaffe,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"December 24, 2020 at 15:45 JST"," Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga committed another gaffe, grossly understating the number of arrivals from Britain, who are now targeted for stricter entry restrictions amid the spread of a new strain of the novel coronavirus. To stress that Japan is safe from the new strain, Suga said on Dec. 21 only “one or two” people enter from Britain daily, but the actual number is about 150, it turns out. The Japanese government started considering strengthening anti-virus measures on Dec. 21 following the emergence of the new variant of the virus and excluded Britain from its list of nations targeted for eased entry restrictions on Dec. 24. “I understand that only people under special circumstances can enter Japan, such as Japanese nationals residing in Britain,” Suga said during a TV news program aired by Tokyo Broadcasting System Television (TBS) Inc. on the evening of Dec. 21. “I heard that one or two such individuals have been returning daily.” But Chief Cabinet Secretary Katsunobu Kato revealed at a Dec. 23 news conference that Japan has had a daily average of 150 or so arrivals from Britain in December, some 140 of whom are Japanese nationals. Kato said Suga might have been referring to “the number of people who have returned from Britain and tested positive for the virus.” Currently, 15 direct flights between Britain and Tokyo’s Haneda Airport operate weekly. Yukio Edano, leader of the main opposition Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan, slammed Suga for getting his facts wrong when the Lower House’s Committee on Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism met on Dec. 23 for deliberations. “Suga’s comment shows the government as a whole lacks a sense of crisis,” Edano told reporters after the committee meeting. One senior government official went so far as to express concerns over Suga’s remark, labeling it a “blow” to the government.

0,Survey: Nurses quit at 21% of hospitals dealing with COVID-19,['By AYAKO TSUKIDATE/ Staff Writer'],"December 23, 2020 at 17:55 JST"," Nurses have quit their jobs at 21 percent of hospitals that accept COVID-19 patients mainly because of changing labor conditions, infection risks and discrimination stemming from their work, a survey showed Dec. 22. “The biggest wave of COVID-19 is raging now, so the mental and physical fatigue is reaching a peak among nurses,” said Toshiko Fukui, head of the Japanese Nursing Association (JNA), which conducted the survey. The survey covered nursing directors at 8,300 hospitals across the nation in September, as well as 38,000 nurses. The JNA received valid responses from 2,765 hospitals, or 34 percent of the total contacted. Of them, 1,138, or 41 percent, were hospitals that accept COVID-19 patients, including designated medical institutions for infectious diseases, while 1,627, or 59 percent, did not accept COVID-19 patients. Fifteen percent of all hospitals said their nurses quit because of changes in their work, such as transfers, or the risk of being infected with the novel coronavirus. The ratio was 21.3 percent among hospitals that treat COVID-19 patients. Among the nurses who responded to the survey, 57.0 percent said they have dealt with cases related to COVID-19. After the first wave of novel coronavirus infections started around spring, 21 percent of the nurses said they suffered from discrimination or prejudice because of their proximity to the virus. Of them, 28 percent said their family members or relatives were insulted by others, while 20 percent said they were harassed by patients. Eight percent of the nurses said family members or relatives were asked not to come to work by their employers. Fifteen percent of the nurses who said that they suffered discrimination or prejudice said they wanted a job other than nursing, while 14 percent said they do not want to work in any field. Fukui said she is highly concerned that more nurses will leave their jobs at the end of the year, when many medical institutions are closed for the holidays. “Nurses work hard with a sense of responsibility, but they are reaching their limit,” Fukui said. “The best support for nurses is for people not to get infected.

0,Britain to lose relaxed entry right due to new COVID-19 strain,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"December 23, 2020 at 16:16 JST"," Japan will exclude Britain from its list of nations for whom entry restrictions were relaxed following the emergence of a new variant of the novel coronavirus. Chief Cabinet Secretary Katsunobu Kato announced the measure at his Dec. 23 news conference and said steps being implemented from Dec. 24 would continue for the “time being.” Appearing on a TV news program Dec. 21, Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga said there were no serious health concerns right now as only “one or two Japanese nationals residing in Britain have been returning daily.” However, he said negotiations were being held with British officials about implementing stricter measures. The government has implemented a ban on entry for nationals from about 150 nations and regions, including Britain, since the spread of COVID-19 from spring. In the months following, entry restrictions have been gradually relaxed through an expansion of exceptions. Since October, for example, those planning to stay in Japan for more than three months have been allowed in as long as they self-quarantined for two weeks. In November, Japanese making short business trips overseas as well as foreign residents with resident status returning to Japan were exempted from the self-isolation measure. An entry ban continues for tourists and others planning short visits. While the relaxed measures targeted all nations, the removal of Britain from the list means Japanese business travelers returning from Britain will have to self-isolate for two weeks, as will returning foreign residents. Those arriving passengers will also have to certify a negative COVID-19 test result taken within 72 hours of leaving Britain and store GPS data about where they have been in Japan. In addition, British citizens will not be allowed to enter Japan for medium- or long-term stays. The World Health Organization has also reported finding the same new strain of the coronavirus in Denmark, the Netherlands, Italy and Australia. However, those nations will not face the same measure as Britain because the number of cases has been much smaller, according to a government source. Still, government officials will consider whether the measures targeting Britain should be expanded to other nations.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14052915
0,Health panel: Tokyo area must do more to stop spread of virus,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"December 23, 2020 at 16:11 JST"," A health ministry expert panel on Dec. 22 said authorities in the greater Tokyo area must do more to reduce business operating hours and prevent travel to halt the widening spread of novel coronavirus infections. “The proliferation in large cities is spilling over to other areas in the country, resulting in rising infections nationwide,” said the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare’s panel of experts on the virus. The panel said concerns are rising over whether medical facilities will be able to treat patients with not only COVID-19 but also other diseases during the year-end and New Year’s holiday period, when many clinics and hospitals are closed. Tokyo and neighboring prefectures have asked restaurants, bars and karaoke parlors that serve alcohol to close earlier than usual over the holiday period. Tokyo has also requested its residents to avoid traveling outside the capital. The expert panel wants authorities to heighten these requests to get more businesses and people to comply. Japan’s accumulated total of novel coronavirus infections topped 200,000 on Dec. 20, with half of the cases reported in the 52 days since Oct. 29. It took nine and half months to reach 100,000 cases after the first infection was confirmed on Jan. 15. The spread accelerated after the third wave of new infections erupted in autumn, and the spread in the capital is particularly worrying. Although the number of new cases over the week through Dec. 21 declined more than 30 percent from a week earlier in Hokkaido, Tokyo reported an increase exceeding 20 percent. In addition, local authorities’ requests for shorter operating hours did not lead to a “measurable drop” in new infections in the Kanto, Chubu and Kansai regions over the past weeks, according to the panel. The experts also said the fact that more cases are being confirmed among people in their 20s through 50s suggests that the virus is spreading at dinner and drinking parties. Data from Agoop Corp., a Softbank Group subsidiary that tracks people’s movements based on GPS data on their mobile phones, also showed that crowd sizes within 500 meters of major train stations are not thinning even with the surging numbers of infections. The seven-day average in crowd sizes did not show a dramatic decline compared with the busiest weekend between Nov. 6 and Dec. 20, according to the data. The decrease was 12.5 percent in the Susukino entertainment district of Hokkaido’s capital of Sapporo, 13.7 percent in the Umeda district of Osaka, and 6.1 percent in the Shinjuku district in Tokyo. The panel noted that Tokyo’s decrease was smaller than those of Sapporo and Osaka, even after metropolitan officials urged restaurants and other establishments to close earlier. Yasutaka Mizuno, a doctor specializing in infectious diseases and head of the Global Healthcare Clinic in Tokyo, said the fact that crowds are still large indicates that the central government’s message has not reached the general public. “Fully halting a traffic of people during the year-end and the New Year’s holidays would be effective in preventing the pandemic from sprawling further in the following weeks,” he said.

1,"Cheap virus tests abound, but come with risk of false negatives",['By SOKICHI KURODA/ Staff Writer'],"December 23, 2020 at 07:00 JST"," In front of JR Shinbashi Station in Tokyo, where there are numerous restaurants and multitenant buildings, a popular newly opened business could be seen drawing a steady stream of customers. Around noon, office workers were entering the test venue on the first floor of a building one after another, where a large sign proclaimed “new coronavirus PCR (polymerase chain reaction) test center.” A 36-year-old man, who works for a manufacturer, visited the venue to take a test for the novel coronavirus before leaving on a business trip. He said he had been advised by a client outside the capital that he “should not go outside of Tokyo.” “ It (my testing negative) will give my clients a sense of security,” he said. A subsidiary of Tokyo-based contractor Kinoshita Group Co. opened the testing facility on Dec. 4. It provides the testing service under the supervision of a medical corporation within Kinoshita Group. The facility is one of a succession of private centers offering PCR tests priced at several thousands of yen that have opened in central Tokyo and elsewhere, luring in those planning to go on business trips or visit their hometowns. “ It is good that the total test capacity has increased,” said health minister Norihisa Tamura at a Dec. 8 news conference following a Cabinet meeting. “But it should be noted that they (private examinations) are not covered by the government's infection control system unlike those available at medical centers with ensured precision.” As infected individuals could falsely test negative depending on the timing and accuracy of the examination, the health ministry is calling on consumers to reflect carefully on the results. Still, the convenience and affordability of the private testing centers attracted a 26-year-old company employee, who booked a test in no time. The woman planned to travel to her hometown in Kyoto Prefecture on the weekend and opted for a PCR test because of its “much cheaper price.” “ I am worried about the possibility of my transmitting the virus, but the most important thing is that the test will make my elderly parents feel safe,” she said. RESERVATIONS ONLY At the Kinoshita testing facility at Shinbashi Station, tests are conducted on a reservation-based system. Saliva samples are taken at the site and tested, and the results are emailed to testees the following day. No doctor examinations are included in the service. Kinoshita Group said it can offer the test for no more than 2,900 yen ($28), before taxes, because it makes bulk purchases of equipment and test kits. The testing facility can handle up to 780 people daily, but it has already been fully booked until the year-end. While the service was initially designed exclusively for employees in the group and corporate customers, the new center was established for the general public based on the company's accumulated know-how. An additional six facilities are planned in the Kabukicho district of the capital’s Shinjuku Ward and other areas in the Tokyo metropolitan region, according to officials, and more testing centers are being considered outside the region as well. While Kinoshita Group formerly accepted those wanting to see doctors via the internet to obtain certificates for overseas trips and other reasons, it was forced to stop offering the doctor consultations after so many reservations flooded in. PRECAUTIONS URGED There are two kinds of tests for the novel coronavirus: administrative examination managed by public authorities under the infectious disease prevention law and private-sector tests made available by nongovernmental entities. Administrative examinations cater to people with fevers and other conditions as well as those who had close contact with infected individuals, and are covered by taxpayers’ money. Services by private organizations are open to anyone, and their costs must be paid out of one’s own pocket. Such tests were aggressively introduced, because demand grows in tandem with resumption of economic activities and because many test kits have been developed. Private tests previously cost tens of thousands of yen, but manufacturers are currently vying for customers by lowering prices. Softbank Group Corp. provides a PCR test mainly for corporate customers at 2,000 yen, before taxes. A medical start-up firm on Dec. 10 started a testing center for the public priced at 1,980 yen, taxes included, per test in front of Tokyo Station. The center was relocated to a larger venue in the Nihonbashi district on Dec. 14 to deal with surging demand. Consumers should keep some precautions in mind about such services. A specific percentage of infected people falsely test negative in PCR analysis. On top of that, the virus cannot be detected immediately after one contracts it. The health ministry has released those issues to urge caution on its website at ( https://www.mhlw.go.jp/stf/seisakunitsuite/bunya/0000121431_00199.html ). As the accuracy differs among private institutes, the ministry is expected to develop a list of private test centers to show their costs and precision control methods as well as whether doctor diagnoses are offered by year-end based on interviews. At the news conference on Dec. 8, Tamura also said that people suspected to be affected by the virus via private tests should visit medical centers, given that patients testing positive in tests not overseen by doctors do not have to report the findings to public health centers. “ Public health centers will be able to confirm patients as positive only when they are tested at hospitals,” he said.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14010108

0,Governors: Resume Go To Travel campaign from Jan. 12,['By KOYURU KINOSHITA/ Staff Writer'],"December 21, 2020 at 16:58 JST"," Prefectural governors called for resuming the Go To Travel campaign in areas where novel coronavirus infections are brought under control from Jan. 12, along with greater transparency from the central government. In an online meeting on Dec. 20, the National Governors’ Association compiled a list of emergency recommendations to the central government following a recent surge in new infections. In the recommendations, the association expressed willingness to cooperate with Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga’s decision to temporarily halt the subsidized tourism campaign nationwide from Dec. 28 through Jan. 11. But it wants the program to resume on Jan. 12 in less-affected areas. The association also urged the government to share its guidelines for suspending or resuming the campaign with the public, saying that the abrupt announcement of the suspension caused “some confusion among businesses and users.” The Suga administration had been under pressure from health experts to suspend the Go To Travel program following record daily high COVID-19 cases reported across the country. Visits to Sapporo and Osaka, two hard-hit cities, were already removed from the campaign in late November. However, Suga had been reluctant to call for a nationwide suspension of the program until he finally announced it on Dec. 14, only two weeks before it would take effect. Many of the 40 governors who participated in the Dec. 20 meeting expressed doubts and concerns about the nationwide suspension of Go To Travel. “I think the central government would have only needed to suspend the campaign in certain areas if it took stronger measures more quickly,” said Shimane Governor Tatsuya Maruyama. “It is regrettable.” Yamaguchi Governor Tsugumasa Muraoka said, “The nationwide suspension will be highly effective in preventing the spread of infections, but also has serious repercussions. The campaign should be resumed in some areas depending on their infection situation.” In the recommendations, the association also asked the government to revise the special measures law to deal with the pandemic so that local governments can punish businesses that defy their requests to close or reduce operating hours to contain the virus. The association also called on the public to discuss the necessity to travel outside of virus hotspot areas, including trips to hometowns, with family members.

0,REPORTER’S COVID-19 NOTEBOOK: Symptoms lingered for months after hospital release,['By YURI IMAMURA/ Staff Writer'],"December 18, 2020 at 07:00 JST"," Editor's note: This is the final entry in a three-part series touching on the experiences of Asahi Shimbun reporter Yuri Imamura who was infected with the novel coronavirus in March. The reporter still experienced symptoms even after being discharged from the hospital. She hopes by sharing her personal account, including the difficulty of quarantining herself from her family, that it will lead to people being more aware of the difficulties of the disease. *** COVID-19 inpatients can be retested in a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test if they have a fever below 37.5 degrees and are asymptomatic for two days. If a negative result occurs twice in a row within a specified period, the patient can be discharged. On the fifth day after I was readmitted, I had a PCR retest because I met the first condition. The next day, a negative result was confirmed, and the doctor said, ""This is good for you."" Thinking that all the difficulties that I had been through were finally over, I sent a message to my family with a joyful emoticon, ""If I get a negative result again, I can leave the hospital on that day!"" However, after that, I had a fever of nearly 38 degrees and I could not say that I was in a recovered condition. While waiting to take a second retest, the doctor entered my room with a disappointed look. ""The first result may be a false negative, so it was judged invalid,"" she said. For a moment, I couldn't understand what she was talking about. She explained that according to my symptoms, the negative result of the retest was a false negative due to the level of accuracy of the test and that meant it was difficult to say that my body had completely recovered from the virus infection. ""I know you were looking forward to being discharged, but I'm sorry."" The doctor's words over her protective goggles made me feel like she was reading my heart as I covered my face with both hands. KEEPING AWAY FROM COVID-19 NEWS On TV, a report said that the number of infected people around the world had exceeded 2 million. I changed channels, but there were no programs that were not related to the novel coronavirus. It became hard to watch, and I turned off the TV that I had always kept on since I was hospitalized. I stopped looking at Twitter, Facebook, and news sites for a while. I covered my ears with my earphones and continued listening to music. I rested for two days after I received the ""false negative"" result. My second PCR retest was conducted on April 17, and it turned out to be negative. The next PCR test I took was on April 20, and I was confirmed to be negative again. I had no fever, and I was finally given permission to leave the hospital. It was 15 days after I was first hospitalized and 24 days after the onset of symptoms. When I was told of my second negative result, a 60-year-old woman in the same room was told she was still positive. I was very surprised because her first result was negative and her physical condition seemed to be very good. ""I'm envious of you for being able to leave the hospital first,"" she said. NEVER GIVE UP HOPE We then spoke to each other. The woman told me she had a chronic illness and that she was infected despite being very careful not to go out and paying close attention to her surroundings. I told her about how I was hospitalized again from the hotel and my experience with my false negative. The woman said, ""It's a really troublesome illness, but I have to overcome this and never give up."" As I walked out of the room and passed in front of the nurse's station, I saw the doctor who informed me about my false negative. I bowed to her and said, ""Thank you so much."" Then she told the other nurses ""Imamura-san is leaving the hospital."" The doctors and nurses who were there turned to me and said, ""Congratulations!"" They saw me off with their applause ringing in my ears. Although I was once overwhelmed by the harsh conditions I faced, I was now filled with gratitude to the medical staff who saved my life. I bowed again and left in high spirits. My husband and two sons picked me up outside the hospital entrance with our car. Although all of us wore masks, my husband hugged me and said, ""Welcome back."" My 3-year-old son jumped up at me yelling, ""Mama!"" My 1-year-old baby boy at first seemed perplexed but after a while, he grabbed one of my legs and wouldn't let go. Even after I got home he would shout in panic if I were to disappear from his sight even if I just went to the toilet. For the past three weeks, I worried about his anxiety and hugged him saying, ""Mama is fine."" It was such a happy thing to be able to hug my children. I was grateful to get back to my daily life. In mid-May, my husband underwent an antibody test at a private medical facility at his own expense and was confirmed to be negative. I was relieved that my home isolation was successful in keeping my family safe. FIGHT STILL NOT OVER For a week after I was discharged I had headaches and felt lethargic, but I started to taste coffee again. At first, I tasted the sweetness of a small portion of sugar, and then I tasted the bitterness of black coffee. After two weeks, my headache disappeared, and I could smell essential oils again. I felt that my body was returning to normal. However, even five weeks after being discharged, there were smells that I still couldn't recognize. One was child's poop. I didn't understand why my second son was crying until I saw feces leaking out of his diaper. As a parent, I was shocked that I didn't notice the smell. In addition, I couldn't smell my usual shampoo and conditioner, which are supposed to have a menthol scent. My fight against being infected with the novel coronavirus will continue for some time.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14021423

0,Tokyo’s strained medical system now at highest alert level,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"December 17, 2020 at 19:10 JST"," Tokyo issued its highest Level 4 alert for medical services on Dec. 17, warning that the capital’s health care system is nearing collapse from the increasing number of COVID-19 patients requiring hospitalization. It was the first time the alert level was raised to the maximum, and it came on a day when the number of new COVID-19 cases reached a record 822 in the capital. The metropolitan government announced the decision at a meeting of its expert panel monitoring the spread of infections. Since July 9, Tokyo had maintained the second highest level, meaning the health care system is not strained but steps should be taken to bolster capacity at medical institutions. The capital issues the alert based on a four-point guideline, including the number of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 and the number of serious cases. The metropolitan government has secured 200 hospital beds for seriously ill COVID-19 patients and 2,800 beds for those with mild and moderate symptoms, bringing the total to 3,000. Now at Level 4, the government asked medical institutions to increase the bed number to 4,000, including 50 more for patients in serious condition. The daily number of newly confirmed infections has continued to rise in Tokyo, resulting in more hospital beds being filled. As of Dec. 16, the number of COVID-19 inpatients stood at 1,960, and many infected patients have been unable to receive hospital treatment within a 24-hour period. Tokyo had 78 serious cases as of Dec. 15, the most since the state of emergency was lifted in late May. The number remained high, at 69, on Dec. 16. One big concern for hospitals in the capital is that more people tend to be hospitalized with heart diseases or pneumonia in winter. To secure enough beds for COVID-19 patients, many hospitals are now freeing up beds intended for patients with other diseases. At its meeting on Dec. 10, the metropolitan government’s expert panel said the local health care system was becoming stretched because hospitals are having difficulty treating both COVID-19 patients and individuals with different health problems. The novel coronavirus situation in the capital has shown no signs of improving. Tokyo reported a then record 678 new infections on Dec. 16. It had a daily average of 534.4 new cases over the week until that day. The metropolitan government on Nov. 19 raised its alert over the infection situation to the highest level of 4 for the first time since Sept. 10.

The Go To Event campaign is a government-subsidized program to support event operators amid the pandemic, while the Go To Shopping Street campaign is a similar program to help stores located along shopping streets. The government has already decided to halt its Go To Travel tourism promotion campaign over the same period, but it decided to move up the suspension period for trips to Hiroshima over soaring COVID-19 cases there. If people purchase tickets under the Go To Event program, they receive a 20 percent discount or coupon with the upper limit set at 2,000 yen per ticket. According to the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, the Go To Event program will not cover tickets sold on or after Dec. 23 for events held during the suspension period from Dec. 28 through Jan. 11. But the program will still cover tickets that have already been purchased, along with tickets for online events. As for the Go To Shopping Street program, subsidized events held on shopping streets during the suspension period will have to be postponed or canceled. New reservations under the Go To Travel program have been suspended starting from Dec. 16 for trips to Hiroshima city, according to the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism. Existing reservations will not be covered by the program if a person’s date of departure is on or after Dec. 24. Hiroshima residents have also been urged to refrain from traveling. If a person applies by Dec. 26 to cancel a trip booked to or from Hiroshima for the period lasting up until Dec. 27, they will not need to pay a cancellation fee.

0,Suga expresses ‘regret’ for joining large dinner party,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"December 17, 2020 at 16:06 JST"," Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga expressed “regret” after coming under fire for attending a large dinner party that broke health protocols recommended by his own government panel to prevent novel coronavirus infections. “I went to the party just to exchange greetings with attendees,” Suga said on a Nippon TV news program on the evening of Dec. 16. “But I ended up staying there for about 40 minutes to chat with them. I deeply regret that.” He was also asked by reporters about the issue at the prime minister’s office in the late afternoon that day. “The public may have misunderstood (my behavior),” he said. “In that sense, I truly regret (what I did).” He added that the attendees maintained a proper distance from each other. But the criticism was mostly about the number of people at the dinner party, which was held at a steak restaurant in Tokyo’s upscale Ginza district on the evening of Dec. 14. The central government’s panel of experts on dealing with the pandemic is urging people to refrain from holding dinner parties in groups of five or more because such large gatherings pose a high risk of contracting and spreading the virus. More than five people attended the Dec. 14 dinner party with Suga, including Toshihiro Nikai, secretary-general of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, baseball legend Sadaharu Oh, and TV celebrities. Earlier that day, Suga abruptly announced that the Go To Travel campaign, one of his pet projects, would be suspended nationwide from Dec. 28 to Jan. 11. Suga’s attendance at the large dinner party has further raised doubts about his seriousness in battling the novel coronavirus. Opposition lawmakers said it is hypocritical of the prime minister to ask the public to exercise self-restraint to prevent infections while he himself ignores health recommendations. Even members of the ruling coalition said Suga should be trying to set an example for people to follow during the pandemic. However, Yasutoshi Nishimura, the government’s point man on battling the spread of COVID-19, defended Suga. “(We) are not saying that having a dinner with five or more people is bad without any exceptions,” Nishimura told a Lower House Cabinet Committee session on Dec. 16. “We are asking (the public) to refrain from (dining with many people) as much as possible and, should they decide to do so, to take thorough infection prevention measures.” His words only fueled the criticism. “The government is sending ambiguous messages, causing confusion,” said Kensuke Onishi, a member of the main opposition Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan, during the committee session, referring to Nishimura’s comment. “The public can’t figure out which way they should go.”",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14027908
0,‘Total defeat’ for Suga in attempt to contain surge in virus cases,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"December 17, 2020 at 14:57 JST"," The “decisive” three-week period for bringing the COVID-19 situation under control ended, and the government has admitted defeat. “Unfortunately, there has been no declining trend” in new infections, Yasutoshi Nishimura, the economic revitalization minister who is also the government’s point man in dealing with the novel coronavirus pandemic, said on Dec. 16, the end of that three-week period. Government officials had said the period would be critical for halting the spread in novel coronavirus infections, and they deployed a concentrated package of measures. But the numbers around Japan have kept rising. Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga told reporters on Dec. 16: “We implemented various measures, but there were more than 3,000 new patients over the past weekend. The number continues to remain at a high level. We must seriously accept that situation.” The numbers, in fact, show that the virus is reaching even wider parts of the nation. In the week just before the “decisive” period, the daily average of new COVID-19 cases nationwide was 2,072. But in the last week of the period, the number had risen to 2,587. The average number of COVID-19 patients with severe symptoms increased by 1.8-fold from 308 for the week before the period to 570 in the final week of the period. A total of 687 people died of COVID-19 in the three-week period. Medical experts were scathing in their criticism of the government’s measures. “Over the past three weeks, there is not a single piece of data that shows the situation moving in a positive direction,” said Yoshihiro Yamaguchi, head of the Trauma and Critical Care Center of Kyorin University Hospital in Tokyo. Yamaguchi is involved with the Tokyo metropolitan government’s preparations to secure hospital beds for those with severe symptoms. He said that for all the talk about a decisive three-week period, the central government did not implement very strong measures. Takaji Wakita, the head of the National Institute of Infectious Diseases who chairs the health ministry’s advisory panel, repeated long-held concerns that the health care system could collapse in the pandemic. “Unless we emerge from the current situation, there is the worry that it will become difficult to treat COVID-19 cases while also continuing with normal medical care,” Wakita said. He said a primary concern is that the increase in the ratio of new patients aged 60 or older could lead to greater numbers of patients with severe symptoms and more deaths. Medical experts had raised red flags throughout the three-week period. But government officials, beginning with Suga, were slow in deciding to suspend the Go To Travel tourism promotion campaign. Suga finally announced on Dec. 14 that the campaign would be suspended nationwide. But instead of immediately halting the program, he set the suspension period for between Dec. 28 and Jan. 11. Takayuki Onai, a political science professor at Ryutsu Keizai University in Ibaraki Prefecture, said, “I cannot help but feel the government was not very serious about controlling new infections.” He said the government should have implemented measures that would have allowed for economic activity to continue while also serving to prevent a further spread of infections. He mentioned subsidies to help businesses repair ventilation systems and measures to support more employees working from home. Opposition party members were also highly critical of the government’s efforts. One Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan lawmaker described the three-week period as “a total defeat” for the government. The health ministry advisory panel said unless greater efforts are made to bring new infections in major urban areas under control, it will be difficult to prevent the virus from spreading to other regions. According to documents compiled by the panel, the nine prefectures of Hokkaido, Saitama, Chiba, Tokyo, Kanagawa, Aichi, Kyoto, Osaka and Hyogo accounted for 75 percent of all new cases in Japan for the one-week period until Dec. 15. Those areas all have densely populated urban centers. The so-called effective reproduction number, which shows how many people a COVID-19 patient has infected, was still above one in many areas, meaning infections were spreading there. According to the panel, as of Nov. 29, the number was 1.15 in the Tohoku region, 1.04 in the greater Tokyo metropolitan area, 1.03 in the Chukyo region centered on Nagoya, 0.99 in the Kansai region, 1.22 in northern Kyushu, and 0.82 in Okinawa Prefecture. Hokkaido had a figure of 0.85, meaning that new infections were spreading at a slower pace on the main northern island, the panel said.

0,REPORTER’S COVID-19 NOTEBOOK: Relief comes with finally reducing risk of infection to family,['By YURI IMAMURA/ Staff Writer'],"December 17, 2020 at 07:00 JST"," Editor's note: This is the second of a three-part series touching on the experiences of Asahi Shimbun reporter Yuri Imamura who was infected with the novel coronavirus in March. The reporter still experienced symptoms even after being discharged from the hospital. She hopes by sharing her personal account, including the difficulty of quarantining herself from her family, that it will lead to people being more aware of the difficulties of the disease. *** The day after I finally got a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test, my entire body was racked with pain. Countless needles seemed to pierce the muscles inside my body. Even if I lay down or sat, I felt a sharp pain where my body's weight was pushing against the bed or chair that I was using. So I had no choice but to stand still to limit the affected area of my body. On April 4, when the daily number of people infected in Tokyo for the first time rose to triple digits, a public health center official called to inform me that I was infected. But I was shocked by her following words. ""Every hospital is currently full. I'm looking for a vacancy for you, but I don't know when you will be able to be hospitalized. For now, quarantine yourself from your family."" I told her no matter how far I stayed away from my family, my kids still walked and played in the corridor between my room and the bathroom. They played with their toy cars on the floor and licked the toys. ""My apartment is very cramped, so it doesn't matter if I don't have access to a medical facility. Can you please isolate me somewhere?"" The person on the other end of the phone replied, ""In consideration of your children, I will do my best to find you a place to stay. Please be patient with me."" While I was waiting for an available space in the hospital, my husband called his mother to tell her that he thought that he might become infected. My mother-in-law, who is in her 70s, said, ""I can take care of your children."" However, even without any symptoms, the children might already be infected. Since elderly people are at high risk of becoming seriously ill if they get infected, we couldn't send our kids to them. I couldn't find the solution to what to do. On the evening of April 6, the public health center called and said that they found an available space. The person said, ""I will pick you up in about 30 minutes. Please wear a mask and wait in front of your home."" I felt relief that I could finally reduce the risk of having my family infected. My husband was also relieved and explained to our children, ""Mommy is going to cure her illness."" It was the 10th day after the onset of my symptoms. TAKING TEMPERATURE FOUR TIMES A DAY A van picked me up in front of my home. A sign on its side read ""Vehicle transport for private-sector patients."" A public health official was in the passenger seat, which was partitioned off with plastic. The van picked up another female patient near my home and stopped at the entrance of the night emergency outpatient entrance of the hospital where I was to stay. When the medical staff in personal protective equipment (PPE) led us from the elevator to our floor, the first thing I saw was the yellow “No Entry” tape often seen at crime scenes. Everywhere I looked, there were people in PPE using disinfectants and wearing medical gloves. I had a CT scan the next day which confirmed that I had a mild case of pneumonia, but the doctor told me that it was at a level that heals by itself so no medicine was needed. Instead of giving me medicine, they checked my temperature, measured my blood pressure and monitored my blood oxygen level four times a day. ""There is no silver bullet for this illness,"" the doctor said. ""Eat well, sleep well and strengthen your body and immunity to beat the virus."" I was hospitalized in a four-person room for people with mild cases. There was a toilet attached to our room, and we could only leave the room for a 30-minute shower in the common shower room. I couldn't go to the store in the hospital and if there was something I needed, I had to order it through a nurse. Of course, my family could not visit me. There were curtains in the room separating the patients from each other. Most of the conversation during the day was with the nurses who came to our room on their medical rounds. SWALLOWING TASTELESS HOSPITAL FOOD The meal wasn't enjoyable as I lost my sense of taste and smell. I couldn't tell the difference between cooked eggs and stewed vegetables with “koya” tofu, which made it hard to finish the dishes. Three days after I was hospitalized, I suddenly was able to taste the miso soup. It was the first time I thought that cold miso soup was so delicious. I didn't have any serious symptoms other than a slight fever of around 37 degrees, headaches and some overall body pain that made it difficult to sleep. There were some nights that I needed a pain reliever to fall asleep. A few days later, the first hotel was prepared by the Tokyo metropolitan government to accommodate patients with mild symptoms or those who are asymptomatic. On my fourth day of being hospitalized, I was told to move to the hotel. The doctor said, ""I would like to make room for patients who need hospitalization as soon as possible."" At the hotel, no one could leave their room except to pick up a boxed meal in the lobby three times a day. Still, because it was a private room, I was able to speak with my family for the first time in a long time. I thoroughly enjoyed taking a shower for as long as I liked. I thought this part of my experience was the moment before I could go home. CHILLS PROMPT RETURN TO HOSPITAL However, I felt chills on the night of my arrival. They did not stop even after I raised the temperature of the air conditioner in my room. My chest hurt every time I breathed. I called through the extension phone and explained my condition while asking for a blanket. I thought that I would get better if I was able to sleep. However, a doctor called me back and said chills could be a sign that my illness might be worsening. He wanted me to return to the hospital just in case. A man in a protective suit drove the van to the hospital. He said he usually works as a driver transporting senior citizens to care services, but said there had been a decrease in demand for such transportation. He said that his wife wanted him to stop transporting novel coronavirus patients since they have children at home. But he explained there were not enough ambulances and private businesses were reluctant to assist in transporting infected people. It started raining in the evening and the temperature had dropped. It was freezing inside the vehicle, but I couldn't ask, ""Please close the windows because it's cold"" to the driver who said before I could say anything, ""I'm sorry, but can I leave the windows open?"" Occasionally, I was hit by the raindrops coming in through the open window. For the first time, I realized that I might never see my family again unless I recovered. Since I had mild symptoms, I never thought that I might die despite being infected. However, it is impossible to interact with family members unless one gets better. I felt something closer to fear than loneliness. My husband told my mother that I was re-admitted to the hospital and she replied while crying over the phone, ""I wish I could take her place. I want to see her again even if for only one second."" When I returned to the hospital, my fever had risen to 38 degrees.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14007889

The daily death toll as of 8:30 p.m. exceeded the previous high of 47 confirmed on both Dec. 8 and Dec. 14. So far, 2,702 people have died of the disease in Japan. Of the 53 fatalities, 11 were reported in Hokkaido, 10 were in Osaka Prefecture, nine were in Tokyo and five were in Hyogo Prefecture. Overall, 2,433 novel coronavirus infections were confirmed on Dec. 15, breaking the previous Tuesday record of 2,173 reported on Dec. 8. Fewer new infections are usually reported on Mondays and Tuesdays because the numbers reflect cases from about three days earlier, close to the weekend, when fewer people tend to be tested for the virus. The number of serious cases nationwide rose by four from the day before to 592 as of midnight on Dec. 14, the fourth straight daily record, according to the health ministry. Tokyo confirmed 460 new COVID-19 cases on Dec. 15. It also said the number of patients in serious condition increased by five to 78, the highest since a state of emergency was lifted for Tokyo in late May. The capital defines serious cases as those requiring ventilators or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) devices.

0,REPORTER’S COVID-19 NOTEBOOK: Young children unable to grasp need for forced isolation at home,['By YURI IMAMURA/ Staff Writer'],"December 16, 2020 at 07:00 JST"," Editor's note: This is the first of a three-part series touching on the experiences of Asahi Shimbun reporter Yuri Imamura who was infected with the novel coronavirus in March. The reporter still experienced symptoms even after being discharged from the hospital. She hopes by sharing her personal account, including the difficulty of quarantining herself from her family, that it will lead to people being more aware of the difficulties of the disease. *** The first symptom was a tasteless cup of hot coffee. As a 37-year-old reporter working at The Asahi Shimbun Tokyo head office, I always start my day with a cup of coffee with my co-workers. But on March 28, I thought the coffee tasted like hot water. A co-worker who drank the same thing said it was delicious. However, at first, I didn't think my tasteless coffee was a symptom of anything serious. That day coincidentally was the start of the first weekend for which a request had been made to residents to refrain from going out in the Tokyo metropolitan area. Along with losing my sense of taste, my sense of smell disappeared. As a journalist who belongs to the Foreign News Section, I had been reporting about residents of Wuhan, Hubei province, China, starting in late January when novel coronavirus infections spread there. Due to my knowledge of the virus, I was deeply aware of how easily it can spread and how frightening it can be if severe symptoms develop. I stopped doing in-person interviews from late February and had been working from home as much as possible. Whenever I went out, I wore my face mask and washed my hands thoroughly. About two hours after drinking the coffee on March 28, I was sure that something was wrong with my body. When I put an essential oil on my fingers, I should have smelled the lavender aroma, but I couldn't smell anything. I tried disinfectant spray and disinfectant tissues as well, but I wasn't able to smell any alcohol. There was news just a few days earlier about a professional baseball player who complained that he couldn't smell anything and tested positive for the novel coronavirus. DOCTOR DOUBTED COVID-19 The doctor said there was little chance that I had a case of COVID-19. I called my husband, who was at home with our 3-year-old and 1-year-old sons, and told him I couldn’t smell anything. We considered whether I should stay at a hotel or to go to our parents’ home, but if I was infected with the virus, the latter might make matters worse. On the way home, I found that a clinic was still open. While I hesitated about going inside, a woman came out and asked me, ""Are you OK?"" ""I have no fever, but I have no sense of smell or taste,"" I told her through my face mask and she immediately took one step back. She then gave me a thermometer and checked my temperature, which was around 36 degrees. I was then given permission to see the doctor. The doctor's opinion was that he doubted that I had COVID-19 because I only lost my sense of smell and taste. As a precaution, I asked him if I could have a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test, but he replied, ""The test is not for reassuring people that they don't have the virus."" REFUSED BY THREE HOSPITALS My fatigue started increasing from March 31. My body felt heavy and it was difficult to even stand up. Although I didn't have a fever or cough, I found that I ran out of breath easily. I called the official hotline again. The worker said that I should see a doctor first. My family doctor refused to examine me because she didn't have the proper equipment. She instead wrote me a letter of introduction to another hospital that has a respiratory department. When I drove my car to the hospital, a male clerk was waiting for me outside in the hospital parking lot and told me, ""Our director suspects that you are infected, so don't come inside and please call the hotline."" I called a general hospital near the second hospital and told them about my symptoms. An employee said, ""You can't see the doctor because you are most likely infected."" The worker even said I should contact the hotline for permission to take a PCR test even though the hotline instructed me to see a doctor. I was at a loss of what to do. I drove to an empty parking lot and I kept calling the public health center from the car. After dialing 134 times, someone finally answered the phone. I then told the person, ""I was denied a medical examination at three different hospitals, and one of them told me that I should get a PCR test because they think I am definitely infected."" Finally, the public health center official said, ""We will consider giving you a test."" Around the afternoon of the next day, the public health center called to inform me that I could take a PCR test in the evening. When I went to the designated hospital, the examination area was in a white tent installed near the emergency outpatient entrance. After a brief interview with a doctor wearing a blue protective suit and a face mask, he inserted a long cotton swab into my left nostril and the test was done. They said the result would be available in about three days. Once I returned home I immediately took off my clothes and put them into the washing machine. Then I took a shower. Considering the possibility I was infected, I started isolating myself thoroughly at home. My husband has a chronic illness, and my elder son has weak bronchial tubes so I thought I should stay away from them. I brought a futon into a small room that I usually use for work and I began my isolation. When leaving the room for the toilet or to take a shower, I carried a disinfectant spray in my right hand and a towel in my left hand, and wiped whatever I touched--door knobs, refrigerator doors, faucets, toilet seats, toilet wash buttons and light switches. I used the shower last. I washed my towels and clothes separately from my family's. No matter how cold the day, I opened all the windows to ventilate the whole apartment. CHILDREN CONFUSED BY SELF-QUARANTINE My 3-year-old son and 1-year-old son couldn't understand the reason for self-quarantining even if it was explained to them. There was no lock in the room I stayed in. My children screamed ""Mama"" from morning till night, without knowing why their mother suddenly disappeared. When I tried to go to the bathroom, both of them rushed to hug me when they found me. My husband had to physically pull them away from me. This was repeated many times. My younger son kept screaming and crying because his mom stopped holding him. My older son made a fearful face because he desperately tried to understand why his parents kept him away from his mother with stern looks on their faces. When I returned to the room from the toilet, I had to run inside as quickly as I could. I held the door from the inside, shouting, ""I'm sorry, I'm sorry"" to my children who were trying to enter the room and kept saying, ""Open it, Mama."" My younger son stuck his finger in the door to prevent me from closing it. I pushed his small finger back out with my elbow, saying, ""Don't come in because I might infect you."" ""Your mom is sick,"" explained my husband, then my elder son just repeated through the door, ""Mom, kiss me."" He remembered a video he saw on YouTube of a mother kissing a child with a cold. Suddenly, I realized fully at this moment that this is a very serious situation. No matter how my kids cried and shouted, I couldn't even touch them, let alone kiss them. While listening to my children screaming outside the door, I repeated, ""I'm sorry"" and blocked the door with a storage shelf.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14004691
1,"Governors ask bars, restaurants to slash hours going into 2021",['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"December 15, 2020 at 19:10 JST"," More bad news is on the way for businesses hoping for a more prosperous year-end and New Year holiday season to help rebound from a dismal 2020. Battling the third wave of the novel coronavirus outbreak, many prefectural governors will extend their requests for bars and eateries that serve alcoholic beverages to shorten business hours for up to several more weeks, extending into 2021. Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike, after announcing the extension of the restriction period from Dec. 17 to Jan. 11, said she felt ""extremely guilty about the business operators,"" at a news conference on the evening of Dec. 14. Koike acknowledged the decision will “impose more burdens” on targeted businesses such as ""izakaya"" restaurants and karaoke parlors throughout Tokyo, excluding its islands. But she asked operators of these businesses for their “understanding,” and urged residents of the capital to refrain from going out for nonessential purposes during the New Year holidays. The Osaka prefectural government the same day also decided to extend its request for businesses to close early for two more weeks. To prevent a health care system collapse due to spike in infections, restaurants that serve alcohol in the city of Osaka’s Kita Ward and Chuo Ward had been asked to close at 9 p.m. from Nov. 27 to Dec. 15. But the prefectural government is now asking such businesses in the entire city to close at 9 p.m. until Dec. 29. DOUBLED COMPENSATION Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga on Dec. 14 said the central government will double the cooperation money paid to businesses that follow the local governments’ request to shorten business hours during the holidays. The current compensation is equivalent of a monthly amount of up to 600,000 yen ($5,760). But Suga said the payment will be doubled during the year-end and New Year holidays. The extension decisions by the Tokyo and Osaka governors came on the heels of Suga’s announcement. In Tokyo, businesses that abide by the extension request will receive 1 million yen for a 25-day period. For the 20-day period from Nov. 28, when the restrictions kicked in, until Dec. 17, the payout will be 400,000 yen. The Osaka prefectural government will pay 760,000 yen to each business that cooperates with the extension request and closes early after Dec. 16. NATIONWIDE RIPPLE EFFECT Other prefectural governments have taken steps to issue a new request that takes a toll on these businesses. Okinawa Governor Denny Tamaki followed the governors of Tokyo and Osaka and on Dec. 14 asked businesses including restaurants and bars in the cities of Naha, Urasoe and Okinawa to close at 10 p.m. from Dec. 17 to 28. In Saitama Prefecture, businesses that serve alcohol beverages and karaoke parlors in Saitama city's Omiya Ward and Kawaguchi and Koshigaya cities are currently asked to close at 10 p.m. until Dec. 17. Saitama Governor Motohiro Ono on Dec. 14 said he will extend the restriction for 10 more days or so. Gifu Governor Hajime Furuta the same day requested restaurants and other establishments that serve alcohol in six cities to shut from 9 p.m. to 5 a.m. from Dec. 19 to Jan. 12. The prefectural government will pay about 500,000 yen to each business that complies for the full 25 days. “With everyone in the prefecture together, I want to put the brakes on infections,” Furuta said at a news conference. In Aichi Prefecture, only such businesses in Nagoya’s Naka Ward had been asked to shut or shorten business hours. But Aichi Governor Hideaki Omura on Dec. 15 said the restrictions will be extended to cover the entire prefecture from Dec. 18 to Jan. 11, after Nagoya city assembly members asked the governor to do so. “I feel the same (as you do), that we have to protect Nagoya's health care system,” Omura told the assembly members. Each business will receive 40,000 yen per day and up to 1 million yen, according to the governor. Keeping in step with Tokyo, the neighboring Kanagawa prefectural government will extend the restrictions in two major cities until Jan. 11. Officials are expected to make a formal decision on extending the request at the prefectural government's coronavirus task force meeting on the evening of Dec. 15. Bars and restaurants that serve alcohol and karaoke parlors in Yokohama and Kawasaki had been asked to close at 10 p.m. from Dec. 7 to Dec. 17. They will now be asked to continue to do so until Jan. 11. Each business that cooperates will receive 20,000 yen per day. After Dec. 18, that will be doubled to 40,000 yen per day. The Ibaraki prefectural government is also expected to announce an extension of the current request for shorter business hours until Dec. 20. Other prefectural governments including at least Gunma and Kochi are expected to make a similar request. NOT IN THE HOLIDAY SPIRIT The wave of decisions to extend the restrictions will deal yet another body blow to businesses already hard hit during the pandemic. In Tokyo's Kabukicho, the nation’s largest nightlife district, many people passed in front of bars and restaurants without stopping, in a hurry to get home on the evening of Dec. 14 after the governor’s announcement. A 39-year-old bar owner in the area said Koike’s decision was “an expected one, considering the number of new infections lately.” “Still, it is the worst outcome,” he said, looking totally disheartened. Following the metropolitan government’s request, he has closed the bar at 10 p.m. since the restrictions took effect on Nov. 28. His sales in the first half of December were about 40 percent of what they were normally, due to the drop in year-end parties. The compensation promised by the governments--even it is doubled--may not be enough to cover fixed costs and expenses that total more than 1 million yen. “Thanks to the generosity of our regular customers, we are just barely able to make it,” he said. Koike said that for Tokyo to “welcome a peaceful new year,” businesses and residents must follow strict anti-virus measures. The bar owner said he will abide by the governor's request but doesn't share her sentiments. “The business has fallen further and further into the red,"" he said. ""I can’t even afford to celebrate New Year’s Eve.”",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14021589
1,Hospital for serious COVID-19 patients opens in Osaka to fill need,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"December 15, 2020 at 18:43 JST"," OSAKA--An emergency hospital set up for COVID-19 patients in serious condition opened here on Dec. 15 with a medical staff cobbled together from the Self-Defense Forces and other sources. The hospital began operating with five of the planned 30 beds as the prefecture’s hospitals to treat seriously ill coronavirus patients are nearing capacity. As of the beginning of this month, Osaka prefectural officials could secure only about 50 nurses of a total of about 130 needed to staff the temporary facility. But they assembled the desired number of health care workers after requesting the dispatch SDF’s medical personnel for disaster relief, as well as nurses from other hospitals in the prefecture and elsewhere. Shortly past 8 a.m., a nurse from the SDF’s National Defense Medical College and two assistant nurses from the Ground SDF’s medical corps arrived at the emergency facility. The new hospital opened on the grounds of the Osaka General Medical Center in the city’s Sumiyoshi Ward. SDF medical staff are tasked with assisting doctors, as well as managing ventilators and caring for patients, among other duties. Osaka Prefecture’s daily new case counts remain at high levels, averaging 350 a day. As of Dec. 14, 75.7 percent of beds secured for serious cases were occupied. But the occupancy rate rises to 81.7 percent of the 191 beds that are immediately available for such patients. The Defense Ministry will deploy seven health care workers to the hospital and Osaka Prefectural Nakakawachi Emergency and Critical Care Center in Higashi-Osaka city between Dec. 15 and Dec. 28. The SDF has about 1,000 registered nurses working at its 16 hospitals and medical offices inside SDF bases around the nation. In addition to their regular tasks, the nurses undergo training to prepare for deployment in contingency operations and aid activities overseas. Apart from registered nurses, there are 2,000 SDF personnel who are licensed assistant nurses. Caring for coronavirus patients in Osaka Prefecture is not the first time that SDF nurses have rendered assistance during the COVID-19 crisis. From February to March, they were dispatched to the Diamond Princess, a cruise ship quarantined in Yokohama Port when an outbreak occurred aboard, to assist doctors. In August, they flew to Okinawa Prefecture to work at hospitals after cases spiked there. But extending assistance beyond their normal duties does not mean that SDF nurses can always be called upon to do so, according to an official close to the Defense Ministry. “They are pretty much tied up with their regular responsibilities at their own hospitals,” the official said. SDF personnel will be sent for disaster relief if the central government deems a request for the dispatch meets three conditions: the assignment is of a public nature, has an overriding urgency and cannot be performed by another entity. But Motoki Terui, a former senior member of the SDF’s medical corps who was involved in relief operations in the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake and tsunami, stressed the importance of building the health care system through the collaboration of local regions, ahead of calling in the SDF. There are about 1.6 million registered and licensed assistant nurses in Japan, according to the health ministry. ""If the SDF has a shortfall of its own nurses, it may jeopardize emergency response in the event of a natural disaster,"" said Terui, a part-time lecturer of disaster medical care with the University of Ryukyus in Okinawa Prefecture.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14021976
1,Asahi survey: 20% of major companies scaled back on telework,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"December 15, 2020 at 17:58 JST"," Amid the popularization of teleworking by Japanese workplaces since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, some companies said they are struggling with the paradigm shift. In a survey of 100 major companies in November, while more than half said they have maintained the same pace of teleworking since spring, just over one in five said they have scaled back or given up on remote work completely. Many of those companies said teleworking has hampered employee workplace communication or lowered productivity. But as large companies eye the coronavirus cases now soaring across Japan, some are starting to shore up their remote working practices. The survey was conducted by The Asahi Shimbun between Nov. 9 and Nov. 20. Of the 100 companies surveyed, 62 said they have maintained the same scale and style of teleworking since spring, while just six have expanded remote work since then. Many major companies are trying to get teleworking to take root as a new way of work for their offices. All the companies surveyed said they have instituted teleworking. “Working at home is a typical example of the new normal,” said Akiyoshi Koji, president of the major beverage company Asahi Group Holdings Ltd. The company conducts sales online and some of its factories in Australia are being operated remotely. “Commuting hours are saved, so employees can use more time for their families and themselves,” Koji said. On the other hand, 21 companies said they scaled back on teleworking since spring, and two companies that introduced telework said they had eventually given up on it. The survey asked those companies why they reduced the scale of telework or stopped it altogether in a section where they could provide multiple answers. Nine companies said telework decreased internal office communication, and nine answered that it had lowered productivity. Seven companies said since COVID-19 cases seemed to be relatively contained, they no longer felt it was necessary. But with a third wave of infections now surging across Japan, some are starting to bolster their remote work practices. In November, Sekisui House Ltd., a major homebuilder, asked its offices in Tokyo, Osaka and elsewhere to lower the office attendance rate to 30 percent. It was about 60 to 70 percent in October. Security company Secom Co. also asked its employees to work from home or stagger their commuting times, and ceramics maker NGK Insulators Ltd. said it plans to reinforce its own telework practices.

0,Tokyo sets Tuesday record with 460 new COVID-19 cases,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"December 15, 2020 at 17:23 JST"," Tokyo confirmed 460 new COVID-19 cases on Dec. 15, the most for a Tuesday, and reported 78 patients in serious condition, the highest figure since the state of emergency was lifted in late May. The daily infection tally topped the previous Tuesday record of 372 set on Dec. 1, according to metropolitan government officials. The officials said the number of serious cases requiring ventilators or lung bypass machines rose by five from the previous day. The Tokyo metropolitan government on Dec. 10 said it has increased the number of beds for patients with severe COVID-19 symptoms from 150 to 200. Those beds are filling up as the number of serious cases continues to rise.

1,"Hit by plunging ratings, Suga finally suspends Go To Travel",['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"December 15, 2020 at 16:32 JST"," Ailing approval ratings, not the sickness spreading among the population, prompted Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga’s abrupt decision to suspend his long-protected Go To Travel campaign over the year-end holiday period, sources said. Suga had stubbornly refused to heed the advice of health experts to curtail or suspend the Go To Travel tourism promotion program after new COVID-19 cases started rising around the nation. Not only had Suga pushed the program, but his close associates also insisted that no evidence existed that the campaign was directly causing an increase in new infections. But the prime minister changed course on Dec. 14, saying the program would be suspended nationwide from Dec. 28 to Jan. 11. He urged citizens to spend a quiet time at home over the year-end and New Year period rather than visit their families in their hometowns. Government officials said prospective travelers will not have to pay cancellation fees if they complete the necessary paperwork by Dec. 24 for planned trips during the suspension period. When asked what was behind Suga’s sudden decision, a source in the prime minister’s office said: “Recent public opinion surveys had an effect. The administration would have suffered major damage if nothing was done.” Results of a nationwide poll released on Dec. 14 by Japan Broadcasting Corp. (NHK) found the approval rating for the Suga Cabinet had declined by 14 percentage points from the previous month to 42 percent. The disapproval rate rose 17 points to 36 percent. In addition, only 12 percent of respondents said the Go To Travel program should be continued, compared with 79 percent who said it should be suspended. A Dec. 12 survey by the Mainichi Shimbun found 67 percent of respondents wanted the program stopped, while only 19 percent said it should keep going. The Cabinet approval rating also fell by 17 points to 40 percent in the survey. Before Suga’s announcement, the central government had only called for minor tweaking of the Go To Travel program, despite the calls from late November by experts for stronger measures to prevent a further spread of novel coronavirus infections. In fact, some experts said Suga’s decision was too late, given that many hospitals around the nation are now facing shortages of medical staff and beds for COVID-19 patients. “There was a need to stop the program about a month ago because of the pressing situation at medical institutions,” Yoshihito Niki, a visiting professor of infectious diseases at Showa University, said. Niki also questioned why the central government did not call for an immediate suspension of the Go To Travel program and instead decided to wait until Dec. 28. The situation regarding daily new cases and COVID-19 patients with severe symptoms has worsened since the start of December. But the inaction on the part of the central government was likely behind the slower decline in foot traffic around some major train stations in the country. Moreover, nothing has been done about suspending the Go To Eat program that promotes dining out at restaurants and bars. Satoshi Hori, a professor of infection control at Juntendo University in Tokyo, said restrictions should also cover the Go To Eat program because dining parties have been sources of spreading infections in urban centers.

0,Suga to suspend Go To Travel for all of Japan from Dec. 28 to Jan. 11,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"December 14, 2020 at 18:10 JST"," Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga, citing the record-setting spread of the novel coronavirus, said Dec. 14 the government will suspend its Go To Travel campaign throughout Japan from Dec. 28 to Jan. 11. “We decided to take the utmost measures to stem the further spread of infections and reduce the burden on hospitals so that people will be able to welcome a calm and peaceful new year,” he told a meeting of the government headquarters for novel coronavirus countermeasures. Suga also pledged to double the amount of relief payment to doctors and nurses tending to COVID-19 patients, as well as restaurants that will reduce operating hours. In addition, the prime minister told the meeting that Tokyo and Nagoya, both reeling from surges in COVID-19 cases, will be removed as destinations under the Go To Travel program until Dec. 27. Japan has recently posted record daily highs in the number of new COVID-19 cases, and the Suga administration has been under pressure from health experts to suspend the Go To Travel program. Visits to Sapporo and Osaka, two other hard-hit cities, have already been removed from the tourism-promotion campaign. But Suga had shown a reluctance for call for a nationwide suspension of the program. The central government and the Tokyo metropolitan government on Dec. 1 only urged people 65 and older as well as those with underlying diseases not to travel to and from the capital until Dec. 17 to rein in the increase in new infections. Suspension from the Go To Travel campaign will mean that people of all ages and medical conditions will be ineligible for the program’s discounts for trips to Tokyo. But for people who live in Tokyo, they will be asked to refrain from using the subsidy program for travel outside the capital. The central government had suggested that the request to avoid travel apply only to those residing in Tokyo’s 23 central wards. However, metropolitan government officials decided that the request should cover all people under their jurisdiction, not just those in the wards. Tokyo has been under pressure to take additional measures to stem the spread of the disease in the capital. Tokyo reported a record 621 new COVID-19 cases on Dec. 12. The metropolitan government plans to request restaurants and karaoke parlors that serve alcohol to extend the period for closing by 10 p.m. until possibly Jan. 11. The initial request was supposed to expire on Dec. 17. The central government’s expert panel on responding to the health crisis called for a more forceful approach, asking Tokyo officials to ask such businesses to close by 8 p.m. But the metropolitan government would not budge, according to sources. On Dec. 14, Aichi Governor Hideaki Omura indicated that the removal of Nagoya, the Aichi prefectural capital, as a destination under the Go To Travel campaign was inevitable. “We will need to strengthen measures against the coronavirus to help maintain the health care system in the prefecture,” he said at a news conference. Omura noted that the campaign has helped the tourism industry in his prefecture. But he said the public health crisis has deepened. The central Japan prefecture has recently reported around 200 new COVID-19 cases a day, and the number of patients hospitalized for the disease reached a record high of 487 on Dec. 13. “Now, we have no choice but to ask people in the prefecture to cooperate with anti-virus measures because people’s lives come first,” Omura said. The governor said the prefectural government is considering extending the period for restaurants and other business establishments in some sections of central Nagoya to reduce or suspend operations, possibly until Jan. 11.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14018628
0,"Japan’s kanji of the year, ‘mitsu,’ reflects gloom of 2020 pandemic",['By RIKAKO TAKAI/ Staff Writer'],"December 14, 2020 at 18:03 JST"," KYOTO--Japan has chosen “mitsu"" as the kanji of the year, widely cited as part of a social distancing slogan, in a fitting acknowledgement of how the pandemic has held the public at its mercy in 2020. The Kyoto-based Japan Kanji Aptitude Testing Foundation announced Dec. 14 that mitsu was the top vote-getter among 208,025 suggestions received nationwide, with 28,401 votes. Seihan Mori, chief priest of the famed Kiyomizudera temple here, ceremoniously drew the character with a calligraphy brush on a sheet of traditional “washi” paper measuring 1.5 meters by 1.3 meters to announce the outcome in an annual year-end ritual held at the temple in the city’s Higashiyama Ward. Government and health officials have used mitsu in a slogan to warn the public of the risks of contracting the novel coronavirus. The slogan, “avoid sanmitsu” (3-mitsu), also known as the “three Cs,” urges residents to stay away from “confined spaces with poor ventilation, crowded places with many people nearby and close-contact settings such as conversations at close range.” Many voters cited the pandemic for why the character most accurately described the year's mood, the association said. Other voters chose the character, which also means secret, citing the fact that a slew of secrets in politics and the entertainment industry were exposed in 2020. Not all reasons voters gave for choosing the kanji were negative, according to the association. Some chose mitsu for another one of its meanings, ""closeness,"" saying that the year has allowed them to form an intimate connection with their loved ones. The runner-up was “ka,” which means epidemic, evil and misfortune, receiving 13,655 votes. “Yamai,” meaning illness, came in third, with 10,369 votes. The ceremonial announcement was held at the national treasure-designated Hondo main hall of the temple for the first time in four years. The annual event was held at a different hall from 2017 to 2019 while the temple underwent roofing work.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14018634
0,Growing alarm in Osaka as virus cases surge among children,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"December 14, 2020 at 15:55 JST"," OSAKA--As Japan grapples with a third wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, health officials here are coming to the grim realization that children, previously considered to be less at risk, can be just as susceptible to the deadly disease as the rest of the population. Osaka Prefecture has reported more than 300 new COVID-19 cases daily over the past week, and schools in the capital city are scrambling to minimize the threat with school closures and other measures. In November, 141 children who attend schools and childcare facilities in the city contracted the virus. The figure was more than double the previous record marked in August when the nation was in the grip of a second wave of the pandemic. In most cases, the children contracted the virus at home, officials said. According to Osaka City’s board of education, 95 children who attend public kindergarten, elementary, junior high and high schools tested positive for the novel coronavirus in November, nearly four times the figure in October, when there were 24 cases. It was also more than double the previous record of 42, marked in August. Cases confirmed in the prefectural capital in November, irrespective of age, totaled 3,730, or 1.4 times more than the August figure of 2,587. A record 15 schools and kindergartens were forced to temporarily shut in November due to the spike in cases. Under the education board’s guidelines, a school is required to temporarily shut if any child or member of staff tests positive for the novel coronavirus. This is to allow public health centers to try to track those who were in close contact with the patients and sanitize the campus. In many instances, schools closed for only a day or so. Cases of infection also spread among children who attend certified and uncertified childcare facilities, orphanages or facilities for afterschool activities. Of the 141 cases in November, 46 children fell into that category. The November figure was 11.5 times higher than the four in October, and double the 23 confirmed in August. In November, a record 47 such facilities reported at least one case of COVID-19, compared with 27 in August. Most of the children displayed mild or no symptoms, city officials said. Many tested positive after a family member was confirmed to have COVID-19. The number of people who contracted the virus from a family member in the same household has also been rising across the prefecture, prefectural authorities said. Between Oct. 22 and Nov. 4, figures show that in-home infections came to 240. The figure for the period from Nov. 19 to Dec. 2 registered a 2.7-fold increase to hit 652. Osaka City’s education board has urged schools to take steps to prevent the virus from spreading from homes to schools. On Dec. 3, prefectural authorities issued a “red alert” to warn the public that the level of pandemic had reached the state of an emergency. The following day, the board urged preschoolers and school children not to attend if a family member was running a fever and displaying cold-like symptoms. Prior to that, it had mandated that multiple members in the same household had to have symptoms. The board also reiterated that children and teaching staff must follow anti-virus health protocols, such as wearing a mask and ensuring they congregate in well ventilated venues. The city’s public health center said there had been at least one case where children who played together with an infected child during the break and afterschool were deemed to have been in close contact with the individual. Health officials acknowledged it is hard to thoroughly enforce mask protocols at childcare facilities. Children and nurses are often in close contact. For this reason, the center has sometimes deemed an entire class was in close contact with an infected person.

Yasutoshi Nishimura, minister in charge of the central government’s response to the coronavirus pandemic, and Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike met over the plan in the afternoon. Koike said both sides are still discussing the matter. The central government has already asked the metropolitan government by Dec. 13 to consider its proposal for temporarily removing Tokyo from its tourism campaign, which partially subsidizes travel expenses, to slow the spread of the virus. The central government is also calling on Tokyo residents not to travel beyond the capital. ""It will also be inevitable to suspend the program for Aichi Prefecture,"" a central government official said. Earlier the same day, Nishimura acknowledged on a Japan Broadcasting Corp. (NHK) program that the central government is in talks with Koike and Aichi Governor Hideaki Omura about the plan to scratch the capital and Aichi Prefecture. He added that the central government will ultimately decide after hearing the opinion of the Tokyo governor. The central government earlier this month urged people 65 and older and those with underlying conditions to refrain from traveling to and from Tokyo, stopping short of suspending the Go To Travel campaign for the capital. But a central government panel composed of infectious disease experts and economists is recommending that the campaign should be halted for Tokyo. Trips to Sapporo and Osaka have been removed from the central government’s campaign until Dec. 15 after the two cities began reporting spikes in new cases. The central government is talking with officials in the cities over extending the suspensions.

It comes as the emperor’s New Year’s greeting to the public at the Imperial Palace, held every year on Jan. 2, has been called off due to the novel coronavirus pandemic. This will mark Naruhito’s first video address to the public. The video is expected to be released on Jan. 1 or 2, but the details are still under consideration, according to the agency.

Osaka Governor Hirofumi Yoshimura issued a request for the emergency nursing assistance early Dec. 11. The two nurses and five associate nurses will assist doctors treating cases and handle special breathing apparatus.

1,Students feast on Kobe beef school lunches to help meat industry,['By KENGO YAMADA/ Staff Writer'],"December 11, 2020 at 15:30 JST"," KOBE--Sixth-graders at Uozaki Elementary School are not allowed to talk at the lunch table to prevent the novel coronavirus from spreading, but that was tougher than usual on Nov. 27. The students could not resist oohing and aahing at the sight of the day’s fare: Kobe beef. “So fatty and it’s tasty!” a student exclaimed. “Very, very tender,” another student said, offering a five-star review. The day’s menu was a bowl of rice topped with prized Japanese “wagyu” beef--not your typical school lunch. At first, Soki Tsutsui decided to set aside the beef bowl until he finished his side dishes. But the smell was so mouthwatering that the 12-year-old gave in and dove straight for the beef. “This is the best meat I’ve ever eaten. Without a doubt,” Tsutsui laughed. “I’m gonna brag about it to my parents.” It was the first time the students have been given the delectable treat, named “Kobe-gyu-dondon,” at their school in Kobe’s Higashi-Nada Ward. But it was not a rare sight. Jubilant scenes like this have taken place around Kobe since October, after the city decided to provide school lunches using Kobe beef at almost all public elementary and junior high schools. Until the end of fiscal 2020, students are expected to be served dishes like Kobe beef stew and Kobe beef sukiyaki more than once, part of an effort to boost the livestock industry left reeling from the pandemic. The epicurean project to beef up school lunches is not limited to Kobe, the capital of Hyogo Prefecture. In the overall prefecture, about 1,250 schools, both public and private, have served students lunches using the prefecture’s specialty wagyu, including Kobe beef. Other prefectures have served school lunches incorporating fancy local specialties as well. Japan’s three famous kinds of wagyu are Kobe beef, Matsuzaka beef in Mie Prefecture and Omi beef in Shiga Prefecture. Children attending 380 schools in 19 cities and towns in Shiga Prefecture have enjoyed school lunches using Omi beef for such dishes as gyudon (beef-on-rice) and nikujaga (simmered beef and potatoes). In Hokkaido, about 1,600 schools have served local scallops at lunch. As of December, salmon, hokke (Atka mackerel) and pollock have been added to the menu. In Aichi Prefecture, Nagoya Cochin, one of the three major jidori (domestic free-range chicken), will soon appear on plates at 1,450 or so schools. Students at public elementary and junior high schools are expected to be nourished with fried chicken and oyakodon (chicken and egg rice bowl). A prefectural official in charge of the local livestock industry hopes the gourmet experience make students “become interested in locally produced cooking ingredients.” The trend in haute school lunches is inseparable from the development of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has taken a big bite out of demand for dishes otherwise coveted by foodies. Wagyu consumption has dropped sharply amid the pandemic, according to the farm ministry. The wholesale price of domestic wagyu in April dropped by 26.6 percent year on year, the ministry said. And some data shows retail inventories increased by about 20 percent from the same month a year ago. The same is happening to seafood consumption. Almost all items sold in the market have been affected, with wholesale prices and shipping quantities dropping by more than 20 percent year over year. Expensive ingredients in particular have been affected because many luxury items are catered toward foreign visitors and the restaurant industry. “They were directly affected by the pandemic and a voluntary restraint on going out,” a ministry official said. The central government launched a project in April to fully subsidize the prefectural governments’ expenses from purchasing wagyu and seafood products for school lunches until the end of fiscal 2020 to boost domestic consumption of home-grown ingredients. Thanks to that, wagyu has been served in 46 prefectures. Seafood products have been served or will be served in Tokyo and 42 prefectures, the ministry said. An official from the Hyogo Prefecture Meat Industry Co-operative Association said the central government’s project has been a big help to Kobe beef retailers. “Some stores had no customers to sell meat to. They had so much in their inventories that they could not store it all in their fridges,” the official said. “We appreciate the stable consumption,” the official said. But they also warned that retailers cannot rest easy just yet. Because of the pandemic’s third wave, restaurants and bars in some parts of Tokyo and Osaka have once again been asked to close early. “Yet another decline in consumption is possible, and that prospect makes me scared,” the official said, urging the central government to continue the project for one more year.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/14008355
1,"Baseball players, fans bid adieu to beloved food stall at Jingu Stadium",['By YOSHIHIRO ANDO/ Senior Staff Writer'],"December 11, 2020 at 13:35 JST"," People from near and far, from hungry students to baseball stars, lined up at Meiji Jingu Stadium in central Tokyo for their last taste of a savory dish served by a legend at the ballpark. Suimeitei, a small concession stand tucked in the hallway behind home plate on the first-base side of the stadium, offered its last bowl of noodles on Dec. 6. For 56 years, Suimeitei has warmed the bellies and hearts of countless baseball players and enthusiastic fans at the historic ballfield in the capital’s Shinjuku Ward. From next season, however, they will have to find comfort in something else. The ailing health of the long-time owner, the COVID-19 pandemic and other factors led to the closure of the food stall. Jingu Stadium itself is scheduled for demolition and renewal after the Tokyo Olympics next summer. People craving the noodles in tasty broth made from dried bonito and dried kelp formed lines well before the stall opened at 8:30 a.m. on Dec. 6. Hisashi Sasaki, 49, a company employee who lives in Tsukubamirai, Ibaraki Prefecture, headed straight to Suimeitei after the stadium gate opened. “I eat here every time I come here,” Sasaki said as he slurped up tempura udon with his family. Junichi Yoshida, a 51-year-old Tokyo resident who arrived with his wife, Takako, 50, also ordered tempura udon. They took the bowls to their seats in the stands. “The tempura is flavorful and it’s so tasty,” Yoshida said. “It’s sad that this is their last day.” FINAL SCORE, 968 SERVINGS The Tokyo Yakult Swallows professional baseball team held its annual end-of-the-season fan appreciation event at the stadium on that day. Jingu Stadium has been the Swallows’ home base since 1964. The event this year was a “doubleheader” to prevent overcrowding amid the pandemic, with the morning session held from 9:30 a.m. to 11:30 a.m. and the afternoon session running from 1:30 p.m. to 3:30 p.m. Customer traffic to Suimeitei remained steady except for a 30-minute period used to alternate the entrants. Around 1 p.m., more than 50 people stood in line to place orders. The waiting time was as long as 30 minutes. Shortly thereafter, Suimeitei ran out of tempura. Staff also scrambled to receive more noodles and deep-fried bean curd. Stadium employees and baseball beat reporters also entered the queue for one last bowl. By the end of the day, Suimeitei served 968 bowls of udon and soba noodle soup. Suimeitei’s owner, Ritsue Motomura, whom many loyal customers dearly call “okasan” (mum) or “obachan” (auntie), could not be there to serve noodles on the final day. Motomura, 79, became ill this summer and has been hospitalized. But her relative, Teruhiro Yamaguchi, 26, ran the operation smoothly on Dec. 6. “Once again, I realize how much Suimeitei has been loved by everyone,” Yamaguchi said. “So many people have said to us, ‘Thank you’ and ‘Good work.’” Misa Tasaki, 57, who has worked at the concession stand for years, arrived at the stadium just after 6 a.m. to perfect the final broth. Tasaki worked part time at Suimeitei’s restaurant located near the stadium when she was a first-year high school student in 1979. The restaurant was run by Motomura’s father. Tasaki said Suimeitei “has kept up the family recipe, making soup stock and seasoning the same way.” Meiji Jingu Stadium, which opened in 1926, has been regarded as a sacred place for amateur baseball. In a typical year, the facility hosts more than 500 baseball games, including qualifying rounds for the hugely popular national high school baseball championships. Norichika Aoki, 38, a veteran outfielder with the Swallows who also played on major league teams, such as the Milwaukee Brewers and the Kansas City Royals, has been a patron of the Suimeitei food stall since his days at Waseda University. “It is sad that the long-established eatery is gone,” Aoki said, adding that he is wishing for Motomura’s recovery. 1964 TOKYO OLYMPICS Motomura’s father came from Kurume, Fukuoka Prefecture, and opened the Suimeitei restaurant in the Meiji Jingu Gaien area. It became famous for its “chanpon” noodle dish, a Kurume specialty. The restaurant served an important role at the 1964 Tokyo Olympics by feeding the Japanese swimming team during their pre-Games training. The restaurant was also used as a waiting room for Yoshinori Sakai, the last runner of the Olympic torch relay. The scene was featured in the final episode of “Idaten: The Epic Marathon to Tokyo,” a Japan Broadcasting Corp. (NHK) drama series that was aired last year. Motomura’s father loved baseball, and her older brother played for the Waseda University team. Shortly after the 1964 Olympics, Motomura’s father decided to open an outpost inside Meiji Jingu Stadium, one of the first concession stands at the ballpark. While the 1964 Games may have inspired the decision to open the stand, preparations for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics hampered business operations at the restaurant. Amid the redevelopment project and construction of new National Stadium, a main venue for the 2020 Tokyo Games, the restaurant closed down in October 2018. The following year, Yamaguchi started helping Motomura at the concession stand. He transformed the neighboring stand that had sold coffee into a meat and pasta place. Things looked bright, until the novel coronavirus spread around the nation. The stadium concession business was hit hard. The opening of the professional baseball season was delayed for more than two months. And spectators were banned from games held earlier in the season. Then Motomura became sick and was hospitalized in August, forcing her to decide to shut down Suimeitei. “I am so thankful for people’s long patronage over the years,” Motomura said through a relative from a hospital in her hometown of Kurume. “I have nothing but appreciation.” ‘A PRE-GAME SPECIAL’ The news devastated Sumiko Nanai, a huge baseball fan from Kanagawa Prefecture. Nanai has come to Meiji Jingu Stadium for more than 30 years since she was a university student. “My favorite is tempura udon. I think I’ve eaten 500 bowls so far, easily,” she said. “The tempura gets so juicy in the broth and remains tasty all the way to the end. The noodles were inexpensive so I could eat them even when I didn’t have much money to eat out,” she said. Many former and current players shared their memories of Suimeitei. Shogo Yamamoto, 42, a former pitcher who currently works as a scout for the Fukuoka Softbank Hawks, said he was a loyal customer during his days at Keio University. His favorite was meat udon. “I ate it before and after a game,” he said. He said he resumed the habit after he retired and became a scout. “My colleague even eats it for breakfast. It is delicious and warms my body and heart on a cold day,” Yamamoto said. “The closure is very sad.” For Yuki Saito, a 32-year-old pitcher for the Hokkaido Nippon-Ham Fighters, Suimeitei’s noodle soup was a “pre-game special meal.” Saito, who previously starred at Waseda University, said all members of his collegiate baseball team stuffed their bellies with Suimeitei’s noodles. “It was so tasty, and the next thing you know, I finished the soup,” Saito fondly recalled. ‘BOWL OF LIFE’ Tetsuya Ikeda, a 38-year-old entertainer and ardent fan of high school baseball, shared his memories of Suimeitei on social media. “I don’t know how many times I’ve eaten there,” Ikeda said. Sometimes, he had three servings a day of Suimeitei noodles. “I had one after arriving at the stadium. Then around lunchtime, I saw someone near me in the stands eating it. The aroma got to me and made me eat it again. It got chilly in the evening, and my body craved it again,” he wrote. At a major autumn tournament held at Jingu Stadium, when current Fighters first baseman Kotaro Kiyomiya was a high school star and major draw, Ikeda said he stood in line at 4 a.m. to get a ticket. “I secured a good seat. I left my bag and headed straight down to Suimeitei to thaw out my freezing body and heart,” Ikeda said. “And it wasn’t just me. Many people did the same. “For me, Suimeitei’s noodles have literally been a bowl of life.” Just after 4 p.m. on Dec. 6, Suimeitei served its final bowl and Yamaguchi closed the shutters. The large pans and other items that have been used in the kitchen for years were given to another long-established concession stand.

0,Virus panel chief: Suspend Go To Travel program in urban centers,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"December 10, 2020 at 19:01 JST"," The chief of a government expert panel on the novel coronavirus said the Go To Travel program should be suspended in large cities where the situation has reached the second most serious level. Those urban centers would include Tokyo, Osaka, Nagoya and Sapporo. Countering the policies of the Suga administration, panel leader Shigeru Omi, an infectious disease expert, said on Dec. 9 that all people in those cities, not just senior citizens, should minimize their movements and contact with others. “The government’s travel campaign will generate more economic benefits and gain broader public support if it fully resumes after we contain the infections to Stage 2,” Omi said at a meeting of the Lower House Committee on Health, Labor and Welfare. He added that restricting people’s movements and contact in areas with surging numbers of new cases is a “ rational option ” under global standards on dealing with the pandemic. Although Japan keeps setting record daily highs for new COVID-19 cases, the government on Dec. 8 decided to extend the Go To Travel campaign until the end of June, beyond the initial deadline of the end of January. The campaign, which subsidizes domestic travel costs, started in the summer to help the hard-hit tourism industry stay afloat. Omi at the meeting said the government did not seek the panel’s opinion on the continuation of the Go To Travel and Go To Eat dining campaigns. Health minister Norihisa Tamura defended the government’s decision, saying it does not have to consult with the panel on every single issue. Omi in late November said the virus situations in Sapporo, Tokyo’s 23 wards, Nagoya and Osaka were at Stage 3 on the government’s four-level criteria. Stage 3 means that infections are rapidly spreading. Stage 2 indicates a situation in which new cases are increasing gradually. Following surges in the third wave of infections in the capital, Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike recommended earlier this month that people aged 65 or older and those with underlying diseases refrain from traveling to or from Tokyo on the Go To Travel campaign. The central government earlier excluded Osaka and Sapporo from the campaign, but only for trips to the two cities. It has only asked people in the two cities to refrain from using the campaign for outbound travel. At the Dec. 9 meeting, the government reported that eight cluster infections affecting five or more people occurred among tourists who used the Go To Travel campaign. According to the transport ministry, which oversees the Go To Travel campaign, as of Dec. 8, 258 tourists who traveled on the program tested positive for the novel coronavirus, while 220 workers at registered hotels were infected. As for the Go To Eat program, 76 employees at 58 registered restaurants were confirmed infected, according to the agriculture ministry, which oversees the initiative. A total of 52.6 million people signed up for the discounts offered in the Go To Travel campaign as of Nov. 15, according to the transport ministry. An online survey conducted by researchers with the University of Tokyo showed that users of the Go To campaigns consistently displayed specific COVID-19 symptoms at a higher rate than people who did not use the programs. About 28,000 people responded to the monthlong survey that began in late August and asked whether they experienced any symptoms over the last month. Of the respondents, 3,289 said they traveled on the subsidy program. According to the results, 29.4 percent of campaign participants and 25.5 percent of nonusers complained of headaches. Twenty percent of the Go To Travel tourists said they had sore throats, compared with 11.3 percent of nonusers. For coughing, the ratio was 19.2 percent among Go To travelers and 11.2 percent among nonusers, while 4.8 percent of the travelers developed fevers, exceeding the rate of 3.7 percent among nonusers. As for the loss of a sense of smell and taste, 2.6 percent of users and 1.7 percent of nonusers cited that symptom. However, the survey results do not constitute definitive evidence linking the symptoms with the travel campaign, according to the researchers. Their findings have yet to undergo a peer review, and some respondents said they already displayed symptoms before they traveled. Omi also said it is difficult to determine whether the Go To Travel campaign contributed to the spread of infections based on the researchers’ report.

In fact, the only non-pandemic item in the top 10 were sweets included with the products of toymakers, according to the survey by marketing company Intage Inc. The company on Dec. 7 released its rankings of the fastest-moving consumer goods in terms of year-on-year sales increases between January and October. Intage estimated the increases from sales data collected from 4,000 businesses across Japan, including supermarkets and convenience stores. Facial masks led the rankings, with a year-on-year sales increase of 425 percent. “In March, shortages of facial masks were severe, resulting in a year-on-year sales decrease, but people got used to wearing them, and sales rose even in summer when they normally do not sell well,” Intage market analyst Toshimitsu Kiji said. Disinfectant was ranked second, followed by thermometers and mouthwash. Wet tissues rounded out the top five. A non-contact type of thermometer was popular. “It was used more in companies and shops, and more manufacturers started to produce it,” Kiji said. In sixth place were sweets included with small toys and cards sold by toymakers. Products related to the hugely popular manga “Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba,” whose movie was released in October, lifted sales in this category. Another anti-contamination product, soap, took the seventh spot. The remaining three products in the top 10 reflected the fact that more people have refrained from going out during the pandemic and are exercising at home and making food that is easy to cook and store.

In Osaka, Governor Hirofumi Yoshimura has already asked Defense Minister Nobuo Kishi to dispatch SDF medical care professionals to his jurisdiction because close to 70 percent of hospital beds set aside for COVID-19 patients with severe symptoms are filled. The dispatch of two teams of five health care professionals each to Asahikawa was agreed on after talks Dec. 6 between Asahikawa Mayor Masahito Nishikawa and Hokkaido Governor Naomichi Suzuki. Among the eight infection clusters in Asahikawa, the situation at the Asahikawa-Kosei General Hospital is especially dire. The 237 confirmed cases there make it one of the largest known clusters in the country. The hospital was designated as one of the core medical facilities in the central Hokkaido city to deal with the novel coronavirus. But even though the hospital has 499 beds, it is unable to accept new in-patients or treat out-patients because staff are too busy coping with the COVID-19 cases. That in turn has had a severe impact on the health care structure in the city. Another large cluster occurred at Yoshida Hospital, where 187 COVID-19 cases have been confirmed. The hospital has 40 patients with the novel coronavirus who cannot be transferred to another medical institution for more specialized treatment, according to a local public health office. And while nurses at the hospital normally would look after two patients each to provide appropriate care, the shortage of medical care workers means that each nurse now cares for an average of about 1.5 patients. At a Dec. 5 meeting of Asahikawa public health officials and those dispatched to the city as part of emergency response teams from the health ministry and Japan Medical Association, general agreement was reached that 24 health care professionals were needed at Yoshida Hospital and other medical institutions in Asahikawa. The Osaka prefectural government is planning to open a facility exclusively for COVID-19 patients with severe symptoms on Dec. 15, but a nursing shortage means that not all 30 beds can be used immediately. A prefectural government official dealing with the health crisis said it was proposed that doctors and nurses be brought over from Australia because of the relatively low number of infections in the Southern Hemisphere. As of Dec. 5, Yoshimura had made requests for the dispatch of health care professionals to not only Kishi, but also the Union of Kansai Governments and the National Governors’ Association. Yoshimura has been in close contact with Yasutoshi Nishimura, the state minister for economic revitalization who is in charges of dealing with the pandemic, about the possibility of dispatching health care professionals to Osaka.

Osaka Prefecture has already requested SDF assistance as most of its hospital beds for COVID-19 patients in serious condition have been filled. Chief Cabinet Secretary Katsunobu Kato promised during a Dec. 7 news conference that the central government would swiftly respond to Asahikawa's request. “The central government is preparing the SDF dispatch so that personnel will be sent promptly as soon as we receive the request,” he said. The city, with a population of 347,000, is facing a dire shortage of health care workers after eight cluster infections broke out. Two occurred at separate hospitals, including one that plays a central role in the local health care system. Asahikawa needs 24 nurses and other medical personnel to fill the void in staff, city officials said at a Dec. 5 meeting with officials of the health ministry and the Japan Medical Association, a nationwide network of doctors. The ministry and the association each has its own emergency response team. The municipal government called on the Hokkaido prefectural government the next day to send the city 24 workers, but to no avail. Prefectural officials said health care systems across Hokkaido are overstretched in trying to meet Asahikawa’s request. The same day, Hokkaido Governor Naomichi Suzuki and Asahikawa Mayor Masahito Nishikawa agreed to seek the deployment of SDF medical personnel to help ride out the public health crisis. Suzuki will issue the formal request as soon as the number of workers is decided. COVID-19 cases have surged in Asahikawa since cluster infections occurred there last month.

On Dec. 7, Osaka Governor Hirofumi Yoshimura toured the prefabricated, temporary site erected on the grounds of Osaka General Medical Center in the city’s Sumiyoshi Ward. The facility is equipped with 30 beds that have artificial ventilators. But not all of them will be immediately available due to a staffing shortage. Officials estimated that 130 or so nurses will be needed, but only about 80 nurses have been secured, according to the prefectural government, which has asked the Union of Kansai Governments, the National Governors’ Association and the Defense Ministry to dispatch nurses to the prefecture. “We need to provide intensive care to severe patients so they can be transferred to a hospital that treats patients with moderate symptoms as fast as possible,” Satoshi Fujimi, who heads the new center, told reporters. Yoshimura said after his tour that the center “is not perfect, but it was a wise decision to open it” in light of a third wave of the pandemic that has left Osaka officials scrambling to prevent the local health care systems from collapsing. The prefectural government has asked local hospitals since mid-November to reserve beds designated to treat severe COVID-19 cases for such patients only. Those beds are sometimes used to treat patients with moderate symptoms when doctors believe their health condition may worsen. But a sharp increase in severe cases, coupled with a lack of beds to treat the patients, led authorities to urge hospitals in the prefecture to reserve beds only for those who require artificial ventilator treatment. Officials have also asked the hospitals not to make the beds available for severe patients who have spent a long time being hospitalized if they are at low risk of infecting others. Yoshimura on Dec. 3 pre-emptively issued a “red alert” for the first time, urging residents and businesses to help curb the fresh wave of novel coronavirus cases. As of Dec. 6, a record 141 severe COVID-19 patients were hospitalized in the prefecture, and 68.4 percent of the 206 available hospital beds were occupied. Officials said 86 percent of the 164 beds immediately available are currently occupied. From Oct. 10 to Nov. 29, prefectural authorities confirmed 8,954 new infection cases. Severe patients accounted for 2.6 percent, or 236 cases. Those aged 60 or older accounted for 80 percent of the cases.

Under the Osaka prefectural government’s standards on the coronavirus situation, the most serious stage, requiring the issuance of a “red alert,” is reached when 70 percent of beds for those with serious symptoms are occupied. Under the red alert, which is like a state of emergency, authorities will request closures of facilities where infection clusters have occurred or were suspected to have taken place. Restrictions will be placed on trips that cross the prefectural border, and Osaka officials will ask elderly people not to leave their homes for services at nursing care facilities. Although prefectural officials are scrambling to secure more hospital beds, they have been unable to keep up with the rising numbers of serious cases. Osaka Prefecture describes patients as seriously ill if their treatment requires ventilators, intubation, an extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) device, which circulates blood through an artificial lung, or care in intensive care units. The prefecture has reported a steep rise in COVID-19 patients since mid-November due in part to outbreaks at facilities for elderly people.

The Upper House approved revisions to the Immunization Law to have the government pick up the costs of the coronavirus vaccines. The government will also assume responsibility for any lawsuits filed against vaccine manufacturers by those who suffer health problems as a result of being vaccinated. In addition, the Upper House also passed a bill to revise the Quarantine Law to extend for up to one year a special measure allowing for quarantining at medical institutions new arrivals in Japan who are found infected with COVID-19. Previously, the period had been set at under one year. The change to the Immunization Law will not obligate residents to be vaccinated, but only asks that they make every effort to do so. Because some people may decide not to be vaccinated due to safety concerns, the revised law also included a supplementary provision calling on the government to strongly urge the public to not discriminate against those choosing not to get the vaccine. The government will also be asked to set up consultation centers for those who feel they have been bullied or disadvantaged economically for not getting vaccinated. The measures passed the Diet as pharmaceutical companies gained approval in Britain for vaccines against the novel coronavirus.

The government designed the subsidy campaign to promote travel and tourism after the coronavirus pandemic dealt a massive blow to the industry. Its core appeal is a discount of 35 percent on hotels and tour plans. That aspect will be kept intact until around spring. After that, the government plans to ramp down the subsidies. It initially budgeted spending for Go To Travel to run through the end of January. But as novel coronavirus infections continue to surge and with the domestic economy on the decline once again, officials will extend the campaign to help prop up the economy. To avoid the number of Go To Travel users concentrating on weekends, the tourism ministry will discuss reducing the discounts on weekends and changing the ratio of the 15-percent discount shopping voucher. The number of COVID-19 patients has risen sharply since the beginning of November, prompting the government’s expert panel dealing with the pandemic to urge a review of the campaign. Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga has placed the program at the center of his pandemic-relief policies, and he may yet have to make more readjustments and face new criticisms depending on how the pandemic situation and public opinion evolve. But Go To Travel is not the only subsidy program in line for an extension. At a ruling Liberal Democratic Party meeting on Dec. 2, the agricultural ministry revealed a plan to extend voucher sales for the Go To Eat campaign. The ministry is expected to include the necessary costs for the extension in the third supplementary budget proposal of this fiscal year. Under the initial plan, vouchers offering additional value of up to 25 percent for meals were placed on sale. They were expected to be sold until the end of January and not expire until the end of March. But under the new budget, the vouchers will continue to be available for purchase after February and will be redeemable until after April.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/13985149

0,The ‘crucial’ time to stop virus is also a vital time for businesses,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"December 2, 2020 at 18:52 JST"," Seven local governments are now asking businesses to take measures to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus, but doubts are growing over their effectiveness and whether complying companies can survive under such conditions. As of Dec. 1, Tokyo, Hokkaido, Ibaraki, Saitama, Chiba, Aichi and Osaka prefectures have requested reduced operating hours or a halt to alcohol sales mainly in entertainment districts, according to data compiled by The Asahi Shimbun. The Saitama prefectural government on Dec. 1 decided to ask businesses that serve alcohol and other establishments in Omiya Ward in Saitama city, and Kawaguchi and Koshigaya cities to close by 10 p.m. from Dec. 4 through 17. The prefecture will provide 280,000 yen ($2,681) to each business that cooperates with the request. The targeted zones each contain bustling areas where group infections have occurred. “We want to curb the number of patients who test positive before hospital capacity shrinks during the New Year’s holidays,” Saitama Governor Motohiro Ono said at a news conference on Dec. 1. “Now is the crucial period.” The third wave of novel coronavirus infections has hit various parts of the country and raised concerns that all hospital beds for COVID-19 patients will soon be filled up. Hokkaido has been hit particularly hard since late October. The Hokkaido government asked companionship-related businesses in Sapporo’s Susukino entertainment district to shorten their operating hours for three weeks from Nov. 7. However, infections continued to spread, so the Hokkaido government extended its request through Dec. 11, suspending all companionship businesses in Sapporo. Tokyo and Osaka Prefecture will pay 400,000 yen and 500,000 yen, respectively, to cooperating operators, 200,000 yen more than their offers after similar requests were made during the second wave of infections in the summer. But some business operators have said, “It can’t compensate for our losses.” December has traditionally been crucial for entertainment-related businesses and drinking establishments, with money flowing in from year-end revelry and parties held by companies. The Chiba prefectural government has not asked restaurants and bars to shorten their business hours, but it urged them not to serve alcohol. The prefecture does not plan to pay cooperation money. The Aichi prefectural government called for reduced or suspended business operations in Nagoya’s Sakae shopping and entertainment district and elsewhere. Those areas received the same request during the second wave. But an official of the Nagoya city government said more people are now being infected at their homes or workplaces. “The request will not be effective like the previous time,” the official said.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/13982703
1,Ex-tax official arrested over pandemic relief fund fraud case,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"December 2, 2020 at 18:10 JST"," OSAKA--A former National Tax Agency official is under arrest over suspicions of his involvement in the fraudulent receipt of more than 100 million yen ($956,900) in government pandemic relief money. Yoshiaki Yamamoto, a tax accountant in Osaka’s Higashi-Yodogawa Ward who formerly worked at the agency’s Osaka Regional Taxation Bureau, is suspected of using his expertise to instruct clients how to illegally obtain COVID-19 relief funds, police said Dec. 1. Police also arrested Takeshi Imai, who used to work at Yamamoto’s tax accounting office in Osaka. The office was closed in November. Osaka prefectural police did not say whether either of the suspects admits to the allegations. In one of the cases involving Yamamoto, police here said he approached a man in his 20s working for a medical corporation where Yamamoto served as an adviser and proposed he apply for the government aid money back in June. The government program is aimed at sole proprietors, along with small and midsize companies, trying to keep their businesses afloat amid the pandemic. Proprietors who saw their revenues drop at least by half over the course of one month, compared with what they were a year earlier, are eligible to receive up to 1 million yen in relief funds. Companies in a similar situation can respectively receive up to 2 million yen. The man was not qualified to apply. But Yamamoto helped him to do so by registering online for the relief program through the industry ministry’s Small and Medium Enterprise Agency by disguising him as a sole proprietor and submitting a copy of the man’s ID, police said. The man later received 1 million yen in his bank account. He transferred 200,000 yen into Yamamoto’s bank account, which police view as a commission. The government designed its relief program to be lean and nimble, so it could crank the taps open and swiftly issue payments to proprietors and companies that found themselves in financial dire straits because of the pandemic. According to the Small and Medium Enterprise Agency, a total of 5 trillion yen for 3.83 million applications had been provided in relief aid as of Nov. 30. But the program’s design left it weak to exploitation, and it quickly became a hotbed of corruption. As of Nov. 30, criminal charges were being pursued against 200 or so individuals in Tokyo and 33 other prefectures in suspected fraud cases associated with the program, according to the National Police Agency. The suspects include company employees, college students and gang members. The damage is estimated to total 146 million yen. The Small and Medium Enterprise Agency began to see a spike in the number of consultations from aid recipients as the number of arrests increased over people cheating the program. There were 8,961 offers to return relief money as of Nov. 26. Of this, the money from 4,728 cases totaling about 5 billion yen has been returned to the government. The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry said it will not impose a 20-percent penalty on individuals who have cheated the system if they voluntarily return the money before any investigations into the receipt of the funds are held.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/13982558
1,Japan selects social distancing slogan ‘3Cs’ as buzzword of year,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"December 2, 2020 at 17:57 JST"," Japan last year around this time was still charged up after the grand success of the Rugby World Cup and the historic run of its national team, the Brave Blossoms. Reflecting the euphoric mood, “One team,” the unifying mantra for the team made up of players and coaches from diverse backgrounds, was named “Buzzword of the Year."" This year, things couldn't be more different. The buzzword chosen for 2020 mirrors a grim picture of the nation under the novel coronavirus pandemic and ignited petty feelings among leaders over who should get the credit for it. As the pandemic started raging in the capital and the possibility of issuing a nationwide state of emergency began floating around in late March, Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike introduced the term “sanmitsu” (3-mitsu) also known as the ""three Cs"" to urge residents to avoid “confined spaces with poor ventilation, crowded places with many people nearby and close-contact settings such as close-range conversation.” ""Sanmitsu"" was named 2020's ""Buzzword of the Year"" on Dec. 1. Since holding up a flip board on March 25 bearing the ""mitsu"" slogan, Koike, 68, has repeatedly been seen saying, “Mitsu desu!” (It’s mitsu!), and the word has become part of the public daily lingo. Including the winner, eight buzzwords on the final top 10 list of the 2020 trendy words were directly and indirectly related to the pandemic. “Abenomask,” a term mocking then-Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's much-ballyhooed nationwide free distribution of cloth masks to protect against COVID-19, was among the eight. U-Can, Inc. the company that has screened buzzwords and hosted the annual year-end event since 2003, selected Koike as the recipient of the award. Koike, who joined the awards ceremony online, said the term sanmitsu “made a strong impression and has stuck with people as their daily life changes dramatically.” But the anti-virus health protocol was actually coined by the health ministry, which pressed the public to avoid the three congested situations early on in March. Together with the prime minister’s office, the ministry created a public announcement flyer which warned that people who did not follow the sanmitsu advice on social distancing risked sparking clusters of infections, also issuing an English version with the phrase, “Avoid the Three Cs!” But the message didn't reach the greater public until Koike started blasting out a shortened, catchier version of it in her appearances. A computer game was posted online featuring a Koike-like figure flying over and running around the metropolis searching for gatherings of people to break up while saying the term, which the governor was amused by and joked about. Koike, at least once, softly warned reporters swarming around her to get the updates on the metropolitan government’s handling of the pandemic, by saying, “It’s mitsu!” Such incidents took off on social media, quickly spreading the term, U-Can said. At the awards ceremony, Koike took credit for the buzzword, saying, “I have done all kinds of things to communicate (the message).” The comment seems to have stirred up jealous feelings among some health ministry officials. Chief Cabinet Secretary Katsunobu Kato, who served as health minister until mid-September, has maintained a nonchalant attitude about the term sanmitsu receiving the buzzword award. “(I’m) not interested in who gets the award,” Kato, 65, said at a Dec. 1 news conference when asked for comment on the news that Koike was credited for the term. Still, he didn't shy away from giving a reminder that Koike was not necessarily the buzzword's originator. “It was at my news conference around March, and I was the health minister back then, I asked people to avoid gathering at such places,” Kato said. “Thanks to many people’s efforts, the term has won the buzzword of the year title.” The fact that the central government was not named as the award's recipient does not bother him and his fellow government officials, Kato insisted. “I said ‘many people’ and, of course, Governor Koike is one of them,” said Kato, with a wry grin.

1,Tokyo to ask seniors to refrain from using Go To Travel program,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"December 2, 2020 at 14:39 JST"," Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike on Dec. 1 said she will ask people 65 or older and those with pre-existing conditions not to use the Go To Travel tourism-promotion campaign for trips to and from the capital. “We will focus on how we can protect elderly people who are more likely to develop severe COVID-19 symptoms from being infected,” Koike told reporters at the Tokyo metropolitan government building. She said the metropolitan government initially asked the central government to temporarily ban elderly people and those with pre-existing conditions from its Go To Travel program for trips to and from Tokyo. But they agreed to call for self-restraint instead. “I think that detailed information will come from the central government, such as cancellation procedures,” Koike said. Koike announced her decision after meeting with Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga at the prime minister’s office, where she asked the central government to make the same request. “I can understand the metropolitan government ’s policy,” he said later. “We agreed that the central and Tokyo governments will closely cooperate and prevent the coronavirus from spreading further.” Tokyo, which has recently been hit by a third wave of novel coronavirus infections, has already urged businesses that serve alcohol and karaoke parlors to shorten their business hours through Dec. 17. The request for restraint on using the Go To Travel program is expected to more or less follow the same schedule. Health experts have recommended an end to the entire Go To Travel program, which offers discounts to encourage people to travel and prop up the struggling tourism industry during the pandemic. “There is no doubt that movements of people are associated with the spread of the virus,” said Tetsuya Matsumoto, a professor of public health at the International University of Health and Welfare. “This could send the wrong message that it is OK for people who are not targeted by (Koike’s) request to continue to travel.” He added, “It would be difficult to curb the increase in infections by this request alone.”",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/13982068

1,"Face mask that IDs wearer, removes risk of direct contact",['By SHIMPEI WAKAMATSU/ Staff Writer'],"December 1, 2020 at 07:00 JST"," NAGOYA--In Japan, ""face"" is everything, particularly when interacting in business matters for the first time. In such situations, an exchange of business cards is obligatory. But the new coronavirus pandemic has pretty much put paid to that as people fear whipping out a business card could spread germs and infect the other person, even though both are wearing face masks as protection against COVID-19. This being Japan with its many innovative ways of doing things, a printing company came up with a novel solution. The company, named Nagaya Insatsu, developed a three-layer surgical face mask that displays the wearer’s name, job title and other details. The information painted on the surface with a special printer is intended to help those who have difficulty identifying and remembering the faces of others they have only ever seen wearing a face mask. “We hope the masks will serve as an ice-breaker to make conversation and supplement the user’s sales skills,” said Mayuko Suzumura, a sales department representative of Nagaya. The all-cotton facial covering works like a business card and comes in three varieties. While the standard type bears mainly characters, images can also be printed on another one. A larger name and message can be painted on the third kind. Established in 1919, Nagaya's core business was making catalogs, calendars and advertising inserts in newspapers. It also introduced a special printer to paint cloth material, so T-shirts featuring the scores of basketball matches could be sold immediately following the end of games. But its sales plunged after the novel coronavirus pandemic hit. Wondering how to make the best use of the printer, Nagaya decided to produce facial gear bearing custom-made designs. It raised the necessary funds through a crowdfunding drive. Some costumers, however, found it difficult to create their own patterns from scratch. So Nagaya weighed providing standard designs, and hit upon the idea of the card-like gear. Nagaya accepts orders for the special face mask on its website. Those who want to buy the product need to select the design type, and then input their name, image and other data. Even a single mask can be purchased. A single card-like face mask costs 1,500 yen ($14.42), including tax and delivery fee.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/13948039

Just north of the capital, Saitama Prefecture became the latest local government to seek shorter business hours to halt the spread of the virus. Okinawa, Japan’s southernmost prefecture, reported that 32 residents, ranging from their teens to 90s, were newly confirmed infected on Nov. 30, bringing the overall total to 4,332. Since July 7, the number of confirmed infections among U.S. military personnel in the prefecture has reached 560, affecting at least 10 bases. The previous daily record was 64 on July 25. Tokyo confirmed 311 new COVID-19 cases on Nov. 30, down from 418 the previous day. However, the number of patients in serious condition requiring cardiac or respiratory support machines increased by three to 70, the most since May. Sixty-nine of the new patients were in their 40s, followed by 68 in their 20s, 51 in their 30s, and 32 in their 50s, according to the Tokyo metropolitan government. Patients aged 65 or older totaled 57. Tokyo businesses that serve alcohol started to reduce their operating hours on Nov. 28 on the request of Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike. The Saitama prefectural government also decided to ask similar establishments and karaoke parlors in Omiya Ward in Saitama city and Kawaguchi and Koshigaya cities to close up by 10 p.m. from Dec. 7 to 17, prefectural officials said. The prefecture plans to pay 220,000 yen ($2,115) to each business that complies with the request. Saitama Prefecture reported more than 100 new cases for four straight days to Nov. 29, resulting in 61.5 percent of its hospital beds for COVID-19 patients occupied. The prefectural government has already stopped issuing premium meal coupons for the central government’s Go To Eat campaign to support the restaurant industry. Saitama Governor Motohiro Ono had been more eager to take measures to prevent group infections at nursing care facilities than to curtail business operating hours. However, Ono decided to make the request for the shortened hours after Tokyo businesses started curbing their operations. Ono believed that such anti-COVID-19 measures should be taken cooperatively in the entire Tokyo metropolitan area, prefectural government officials said.

0,OLYMPICS/ Anti-COVID-19 measures to add 100 billion yen to cost of Games,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"November 30, 2020 at 18:26 JST"," About 100 billion yen ($962.5 million) will be needed for anti-virus measures at the Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics next summer, fueling an expected showdown over who will cover the rising costs of the pandemic-delayed events, sources said. Organizers also expect to add an extra budget of 200 billion yen to cover other items, such as labor costs and maintenance of venues, the sources said Nov. 29. The sources said the 100-billion-yen anti-virus budget will pay for goods and equipment to prevent the novel coronavirus from spreading. The amount could increase or decrease depending on the pandemic situation, the development of vaccines and whether the number of spectators will be restricted at the Games. With the extra costs caused by the postponement of the 2020 Olympics and Paralympics now expected to reach about 300 billion yen, organizers plan to streamline some aspects of the sports extravaganza and obtain new sponsorships. The central government and the Tokyo metropolitan government are expected to take up the slack, but how much each side will cover remains to be seen. The coordination committee of the central government, the Tokyo metropolitan government and the Tokyo Organizing Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games is expected to reach an outline of an agreement by the end of December. The committee also said it will not make a decision on whether to restrict attendance at the venues until spring next year. The central government has insisted that it should cover only the costs to build the new National Stadium and the Paralympic Games budget, arguing that “the host city of the Games is Tokyo.” “The tug-of-war between the central government and the metropolitan government will intensify,” multiple sources said. Officials of the central and metropolitan governments are considering placing some of the costs of the anti-COVID-19 measures in a non-Olympic budget, which would allow the money to be used for things not related to the Games, according to the sources. The Tokyo metropolitan government’s savings have plummeted from 900 billion yen to 170 billion yen because of the pandemic. The downhill trend will likely continue as the resurgence in infections in the capital will force the metropolitan government to provide businesses with additional relief money while tax revenues will likely diminish. As of the end of 2019, the budget for the Games was 1.35 trillion yen. The organizers were expected to cover 603 billion yen of the total, while the metropolitan government would pick up 597 billion yen of the tab and the central government would pay 150 billion yen. According to an agreement between the International Olympic Committee and the host city, if the organizers fall into the red, the Tokyo metropolitan government is expected to fill the gap. If that is difficult, then the central government will cover the loss. Officials expect it will be difficult to make up for the additional expenses. Organizers have already asked sponsors to make additional investments into the Tokyo Olympics by the end of the year. But they have not received a favorable response from these companies because of the pandemic. Olympic organizers previously calculated that about 300 billion yen in additional expenses would be needed for things other than the COVID-19 measures, such as venue maintenance, compensation for the operators of various facilities for the postponement of the Games, and personnel expenses. In September, the organizers and the IOC reached an agreement to partially offset the huge financial loss caused by the postponement by simplifying 52 items. They estimated savings of about 30 billion yen at the time. But sources now say the organizers have negotiated with the venues over the compensation amount and will be able to save more than the initial estimate. The additional expenses for things other than the COVID-19 measures should be about 200 billion yen, sources said.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/13975839

0,"Brain invasions by coronavirus causing memory loss, other issues",['By KAI ICHINO/ Staff Writer'],"November 30, 2020 at 08:00 JST"," A family of a man in his 20s who contracted the new coronavirus in March found him lying on the floor unconscious, convulsing and vomiting. The man, who lives in Yamanashi Prefecture, was taken to the University of Yamanashi Hospital by ambulance. The cerebrospinal fluid around the brain was analyzed with a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) examination, testing positive. He apparently had developed meningitis, in which meninges between the skull and brain are inflamed. An MRI brain scan spotted inflammation in the hippocampus, a section responsible for memories. After he was discharged from the medical center, the individual reportedly could not clearly remember things that had occurred over the past few years, although that does not significantly interfere with his daily life. The memory problem is suspected to be linked to the coronavirus infection, but the detailed cause has yet to be confirmed. The man's case is among a succession of reports from around the world that the novel coronavirus has invaded the brain of some patients and “possibly caused serious cerebral damage.” In those cases, patients were suffering from memory impairment as well as meningitis, brain inflammation and disturbance of consciousness, raising concerns about the aftereffects of COVID-19. Experts are now moving to identify the mechanism of the virus’ infection leading to brain lesions. REPORTS POPPING UP AROUND WORLD In Britain, a 59-year-old woman experienced a disturbance of consciousness after complaining of a fever and headache, and was diagnosed as being affected by the virus after hospitalization. The results of her MRI scan revealed that her brain suffered swelling and bleeding, defining the patient’s symptom as acute necrotizing encephalopathy. She was placed in intensive care but died on the 10th day of her hospitalization. A German research team in July analyzed 92 academic theses and reports detailing nervous symptoms connected to the coronavirus infection. The findings showed 20 percent of virus carriers showed signs of headache, while 7 percent and 5 percent developed dizziness or consciousness disturbance, respectively. Meningitis, brain inflammation and Guillain-Barre syndrome associated with numbed limbs were also reported in some instances. A paper released by a British team in July shows similar results: Of 43 confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patients, delirium and other brain dysfunctions were detected in 10, brain inflammation in 12, and cerebral strokes in eight. According to experts, viruses could affect cerebral cells in two ways: going through olfactory nerves and blood vessels to reach brain cells; or invading other organs to exert influence on the head. If the former is the case for COVID-19, viruses proliferate in the brain and lead to inflammation to cause damage to the central nerve in the brain. Under the latter theory, other organs are infected so an excessive immune response known as a cytokine storm emerges, resulting in inflammation in the entire body and damage to the brain’s central nervous system. Satoshi Kamei, director of the nerve infectious disease center of the Ageo Central General Hospital, who is knowledgeable about brain inflammation, said the “cytokine storm theory can explain cerebral conditions (deriving from COVID-19 infection) better than the direct infection argument.” That is because, according to Kamei, patients often test negative in PCR analysis of cerebrospinal fluid, and because an increased amount of cytokine in cerebrospinal fluid has been determined. EFFECTS ON BRAIN MAY BE ‘UNAVOIDABLE’ In the meantime, evidence has also been found suggesting that the novel coronavirus directly reaches the brain. A team including Akiko Iwasaki, a medicine professor at Yale University, announced in September in its thesis that it confirmed nerve cells could be infected with the virus, using a tiny volume of cerebral tissue made of neurons derived from human induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells. It was also revealed that the virus proliferates in infected cells to deprive surrounding cells of oxygen, killing tissue around the infected area. Back in Japan, Hideyuki Okano, a physiology professor at Keio University, and his colleagues are researching the new type of coronavirus by creating nerve cells from iPS cells as well. “Using iPS cells, it is possible to check through an experiment how the new coronavirus affects the nerve system in vitro,” said Okano. Fumihiro Taguchi, a former senior official at the National Institute of Infectious Diseases, pointed out that it is “still difficult to determine the mechanism of the virus impacting the brain.” According to Taguchi, the entire body has already been affected by the virus by the time its effects on the brain are discovered, often rendering it impossible to confirm the route of infection. “No matter what mechanism the virus uses, its effect on the brain might be unavoidable,” Taguchi said. “The important thing is that people should take precautions to reduce the risk of infection as much as possible.”",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/13944921

The count, as of 9 p.m. the same day, marked the third consecutive day that more than 2,500 new cases were logged over a 24-hour period. Tokyo registered 561, the highest of the country’s 47 prefectures, followed by 463 in Osaka Prefecture and 252 in Hokkaido. There were 14 new deaths reported nationwide on Nov. 28 due to the novel coronavirus. The daily count of new cases on Nov. 28 in Tokyo pushed the accumulated total of COVID-19 patients in the capital past 40,000. The pace of the spread of the disease is accelerating, according to metropolitan officials. It took about two months for Tokyo to see the overall total of cases climb to 30,000 from 20,000. From there, it took only about a month for the number to hit 40,000. The number of patients in serious condition is also trending upward across the nation, according to the health ministry. As of Nov. 27, a record 440 patients were suffering from severe symptoms. The number of patients meeting Tokyo’s definition of serious cases--requiring ventilators or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) devices--rose by six from the day before to 67 in the capital on Nov. 28. That marked a new high since a state of emergency was lifted for Tokyo over the pandemic in late May. Five other prefectures broke their daily records of new cases on Nov. 28, with Yamagata recording six; Ibaraki, 66; Chiba, 113; Mie, 29; and Oita, 18. In Mie Prefecture, a cluster of 10 cases was reported among recruits attending the prefectural police academy. Following outbreaks in southern Ibaraki Prefecture, prefectural officials urged residents in eight municipalities, including Tsuchiura and Tsukuba, to stay home from Nov. 28 to Dec. 13 unless for essential reasons.

1,Study: Opening windows not best defense against droplets in car,['By NAMI SUGIURA/ Staff Writer'],"November 27, 2020 at 19:03 JST"," Air conditioning is more effective at fully ventilating a car than cracking open the windows, according to new research done using the world’s fastest supercomputer. A team led by the government-affiliated research institute Riken announced the results on Nov. 26 from its study into how droplets spread throughout the inside of taxis, part of its research into preventative measures against the novel coronavirus. It crunched the numbers on the Fugaku supercomputer. As it turns out, opening the taxi cab’s windows to boost air ventilation actually has a limited effect as a protective measure, the researchers said. They found it is more important to take in outside air by running the air conditioner on fresh-air mode and to continue wearing face masks during the ride. “The ventilation ability of air conditioners is very high and increasing the air conditioner’s airflow volume is more effective than opening the windows,” said Makoto Tsubokura, Riken’s research team leader and a computational science professor at Kobe University. “In the cases where a passenger in a backseat coughs, wearing a mask proved very effective as the first preventative measure.” The team ran simulations on the inside of a taxi with a driver and two passengers traveling at about 40 kph in a city. It examined two scenarios: one where the taxi has its windows closed but is running an air conditioner that takes in outside air, and another where windows diagonally across from each other are open. In the open-window scenario, the window to the right of the driver, along with the window on the left side of the back seat, are cracked open by five centimeters. With the car’s air conditioner set to half its maximum airflow volume with the windows closed, it took 85 seconds for the taxi to be fully ventilated. Meanwhile, opening the windows beat it by just a little. It takes 68 seconds for the air to circulate out of the car, more effective by 25 percent. If the taxi slows to 20 kph with the windows open, the results were not too promising: 82 seconds. By contrast, the air ventilates within 45 seconds after closing the windows and putting the air conditioner on its maximum airflow setting. If a driver not wearing a facial mask coughs, small droplets will spread throughout the inside of the car in the direction of the air conditioner’s airflow, according to the supercomputer’s calculation. If the windows are opened diagonally, a quarter of those droplets go out the windows within 20 seconds, but a lot of the droplets still manage to reach the back seat. However, if there are partitions set up between the driver and passenger seats, the droplets will effectively blow out of the car’s open windows. But then if a passenger without a face mask coughs, opening the windows proves ineffective. In this case, the partitions did little to completely prevent small airborne droplets from spreading. The team also studied how droplets spread through karaoke parlors and airplanes. In a scenario where nine people gather in a small karaoke room measuring 21 cubic meters and one of them sings, their droplets spread over the entire room within about 30 seconds. However, there are differences in the results depending on where they position themselves to sing. The air circulation systems of airplanes will, meanwhile, purify the cabin’s air within about three minutes, according to the supercomputer’s results.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/13968048

Following a spike in COVID-19 cases, Aichi Governor Hideaki Omura on Nov. 26 said he will ask some restaurants in Nagoya’s Kinsan and Sakae entertainment districts to cut their operating hours or close temporarily from Nov. 29 through Dec. 18. The Aichi prefectural government will provide up to 400,000 yen ($3,847), or 20,000 yen a day, as financial support to businesses that comply with the request. “We want to contain the spread of the virus by preventing cluster infections from occurring,” Omura said, calling for cooperation. The request is based on the special measures law to deal with the pandemic and mainly targets snack bars and other establishments where staff members entertain customers, as well as karaoke parlors that serve alcohol. The prefectural government will ask such businesses to close between 9 p.m. and 5 a.m. if they comply with anti-infection guidelines. Those that do not follow the guidelines will be urged to suspend their operations. Izakaya pubs, “yakiniku” barbecue restaurants and other establishments not covered in the request will also be asked to close by 9 p.m. About 2,500 restaurants will be subject to the request, according to the prefectural government. The Osaka prefectural government will also ask restaurants that sell alcohol in Kita and Chuo wards in central Osaka to close between 9 p.m. and 5 a.m. from Nov. 27 through Dec. 11. “It’ an agonizing decision, but we must prevent a further spread of the virus now that the local health care system is extremely strained,” Osaka Governor Hirofumi Yoshimura said on Nov. 26. Kita and Chuo wards are home to the popular Kita and Minami entertainment districts. Around 25,000 restaurants are located within or near those areas, accounting for nearly half of the roughly 54,000 establishments in the city. The governor’s request is mainly targeted at those that serve alcohol. The central government as well as the Osaka prefectural and city governments will provide 500,000 yen in financial support to each business that complies with the request. A Hokkaido government task force dealing with the health crisis on Nov. 26 decided to extend by two weeks the current three-week period that started on Nov. 7 for taking intensive measures to prevent infections. The Hokkaido government will ask entertainment-style businesses in Sapporo, the capital of the northernmost main island, to close temporarily from Nov. 28 through Dec. 11 to stem the spread of the virus. “The local health care system is under increasing strain and will likely become unable to provide proper medical care, particularly in Sapporo, if the situation continues,” Hokkaido Governor Naomichi Suzuki said at the task force meeting. “We’ll focus on taking thorough measures over the next two weeks.” The measures will include requests from the Hokkaido government for host and hostess clubs and similar establishments in Sapporo to suspend their operations.

Health minister Norihisa Tamura announced on Nov. 27 that approximately 15,000 tests will be conducted by year-end. The first national antibody tests were conducted in Tokyo and Osaka and Miyagi prefectures in June. Those areas will be included in the second round of testing along with Aichi and Fukuoka prefectures. The antibody test measures proteins that can be created in the body following infections, or antibodies. The test is not suitable for a current determination of infection but can ascertain whether a subject has been infected in the past. The government hopes to determine how widely the infection has spread in Japan and how much of the population obtained immunity. It plans to test 3,000 people in each prefecture for residents aged 20 or older, who will be chosen at random. It added Aichi and Fukuoka prefectures because COVID-19 cases are surging there. In June, the first test was conducted among populous prefectures. Tokyo and Osaka Prefecture were chosen because of their higher number of cases while Miyagi Prefecture was selected due to its lower number. The government conducted the test with measurement methods of two makers for roughly 8,000 residents in Tokyo and two other prefectures.

Hagiuda added that local governments that are in charge of public schools in their jurisdictions should be very careful before making any decision to close all schools under their watch. Regarding the university entrance exam, the government’s panel of experts determined that the risk of infection was low compared to other events that draw a large number of people, Hagiuda pointed out.

Medical experts and metropolitan officials voiced alarm over the anticipated increase in serious cases in the coming days at a meeting on Nov. 26. “The growth in the number of COVID-19 patients with serious symptoms would make it extremely difficult for Tokyo hospitals to care for patients with other diseases alongside them,” an official said.

0,Health experts fed up with tepid response to surge in virus cases,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"November 26, 2020 at 18:31 JST"," Tempers are boiling over and patience is in short supply as health care experts stew over the inaction of national and local officials as the novel coronavirus pandemic grows from bad to worse. “We are at a critical time,” Shigeru Omi, who heads the central government panel of experts dealing with the novel coronavirus pandemic, warned at a news conference in Tokyo on Nov. 25. The panel members, growing increasingly frustrated with the governments’ limited or non-action to contain the pandemic’s third wave, held another meeting that day, less than a week after their previous one. With a new proposal in hand, the panel members once again pressed the leaders to take immediate action to prevent hospitals from being overwhelmed by infections. “The speed of infections spreading is so rapid in some areas and infection clusters are occurring at a high level on a widespread scale,” the panel said in the latest proposal. “The health care delivery system in these areas has already been under grim circumstances. “The way things now stand, lives that can be saved under the normal health care system will not be saved,” said the proposal, which is filled with a profound sense of crisis. The longer it takes for the central and local governments to step in and do something to change the tide, “the more the effects on socio-economic activities will be brutal,” the panel concluded. ‘GOVERNORS KNOW BEST’ The health experts' frustration stems from the dire reality that at least six prefectures have reached more than half the conditions set by the panel to indicate the level of risk of infection. As of Nov. 23, Aichi and Osaka prefectures have met all six criteria of stage 3, where the number of new infection cases surges to the point where the government must impose stricter restrictions on economic activities. Tokyo, Hyogo and Okinawa prefectures have hit five of the six criteria, while Hokkaido has met four, according to the data released by Yasutoshi Nishimura, the state minister in charge of economic revitalization, who is also the central government’s point person in dealing with the pandemic, at the news conference. Some of the governors have taken action, asking residents and businesses to cooperate to prevent the regional health care system from collapsing. The Tokyo and Osaka governors have asked restaurants and bars in certain areas to close earlier. Osaka and Sapporo, two cities popular with tourists, have been dropped from Go To Travel after the panel on Nov. 20 called for a revision of the central government’s discount campaign to boost consumer spending and support the tourism sector, which has been battered by the pandemic. Both governors on Nov. 24 asked the central government for their prefectural capitals to be excluded from the program to deal with the recent virus surge. However, none of the six governors has officially declared a stage 3. Nishimura at the news conference shared the panel’s strong concerns and said, “This is a very important phase in an effort to stop the upsurge of virus infections.” But asked if the central government would pressure these governors to declare a stage 3, Nishimura avoided responding directly, saying, “Governors know best.” “We have continued to communicate with them closely,” he added. CAN'T HAVE IT BOTH WAYS To some extent, the current situation has been inevitable. After the pandemic’s first wave that hit Japan in spring had ended, the central government has shifted gears to balance anti-virus measures with recovery in economic activities. Easing restrictions on the number of attendees at public events was one example, as well as launching the Go To Travel and Eat campaigns, which are intended to stimulate consumer activity. But these policies have come with high risks of spreading the virus through more human contacts. Having it both ways requires a difficult juggling act. Therefore, the panel in August proposed establishing a system, in which the level of pandemic situation is divided into four stages. Depending on the stage, governments put the brakes on or ease socio-economic activities such as travel and dining. Stage 1 is where new infection cases are sporadically reported. When the number of new cases is on a gradual rise, the panel declares the situation a stage 2. At stage 3, there is a major surge in the number of new infection cases. Stage 4 is when the number sees an explosive increase. At stage 3, the central and local governments are supposed to impose tighter restrictions on economic activities. At stage 4, governments will consider issuing a state of emergency. But the decision to declare a stage is left to the governors. At the National Governors’ Association’s online meeting on Nov. 23, many governors expressed difficulties in deciding when to drop certain areas from the Go To Travel campaign. The association urged the central government to set clear standards and guidelines. Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike on Nov. 24 said of excluding the capital from the Go To Travel program, “It is the central government’s responsibility to decide.” WASTE OF TIME Such a political tug of war is nothing more than a waste of time for the overstretched medical workers on the front lines. “All over the country, the health care delivery system is on the brink of collapse,” Toshio Nakagawa, who heads the Japan Medical Association, said on Nov. 25. “We could not anticipate this two weeks ago,” Nakagawa said, emphasizing the seriousness of the current situation. In November alone, the number of new infection cases nationally has already exceeded 34,000. In the past two weeks, the number of new cases per week has increased at a rate of 1.5 times. If this trend continues, experts are afraid that the tally of new cases per week will hit 50,000 in three weeks. Nakagawa pointed out that the health care institutions that have taken in COVID-19 patients have been plagued by shortages of doctors and nurses, because many have been infected with the virus themselves or exposed to a virus carrier and forced to quarantine at home. To secure beds for COVID-19 patients, some hospitals have had to refuse to accept patients suffering from strokes and myocardial infarctions. Responding to such a crisis, the panel on Nov. 25 urged the six prefectural governments to make a quick judgment and immediately implement measures required for stage 3. These measures include asking restaurants and bars that serve alcoholic beverages to shorten their business hours and urging people to refrain from going to places that serve alcohol and offer nightlife entertainment. If appropriate health protocols and necessary anti-virus measures are not implemented, the governors should urge residents not to travel to and from areas that are not at stage 3 for three weeks, the panel said.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/13964839
0,Experts call for halting Go To Travel trips from virus hotspots,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"November 26, 2020 at 17:48 JST"," Health experts are urging the government to consider suspending trips under the Go To Travel campaign from hotspot areas where COVID-19 cases are surging. The government’s expert panel on the coronavirus pandemic issued the call on Nov. 25, asking that it freeze trip bookings from areas that have reached around the second-highest level of novel coronavirus infections, known as stage 3. The government recently decided to temporarily halt new reservations under the tourism promotion campaign for destinations where infections are spreading. But that did not cover trips out of those areas. The panel’s latest recommendations cautioned that people need to avoid travel to and from areas at the “equivalent” of the stage 3 level as much as possible unless necessary measures are taken to prevent infections. Under the panel’s four-stage classification system, areas in stage 3 have a sharp increase in new infections. Shigeru Omi, who heads the panel, said at a news conference that Sapporo, Tokyo’s 23 wards, Nagoya and Osaka are now all at the equivalent of stage 3. The panel urged stage 3 regions to implement stronger measures to contain the spread of the virus over the next three weeks, and expressed alarm over “a lack of necessary measures in some areas” that are at about that level. Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga has rejected suspending the Go To Travel campaign outright or launching a further review of the program. Suga said at a Lower House Budget Committee meeting on Nov. 25 that more than 40 million people have traveled under the campaign, but only 180 of them have been confirmed infected with the virus so far. “The campaign is not directly linked to the recent surge in infections,” he said, noting that the panel found no solid evidence at this point to indicate the program was a key factor behind the recent spike. The central government decided on Nov. 24 to temporarily drop Sapporo and Osaka, where COVID-19 cases are rising, from the campaign. Suga called it a preventative measure to tamp down on the virus from further spreading in the cities and protect the local health care systems.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/13964692

Subsidized trips to the two cities, hit hard by the third wave of novel coronavirus infections, will be unavailable for at least three weeks, tourism minister Kazuyoshi Akaba said at a Nov. 24 news conference after a Cabinet meeting. He said that people who have already booked hotels or arranged travel packages in Osaka or Sapporo during the targeted period will not receive the deep discount provided under the Go To Travel campaign, but they will not have to pay for cancellation fees if they forgo those trips. The government, in principle, will pay tourism businesses 35 percent of each canceled trip as compensation for the lost business. “This is a precaution to avoid placing a burden on the health care systems in regions where there are many (COVID-19) patients with severe symptoms,” Akaba said, adding that other areas could also be excluded from the campaign depending on the situation. A final decision is expected soon. While government officials hope the announcement will prevent travelers from crowding Sapporo and Osaka, residents of the two cities can still use the Go To Travel campaign for subsidized travel. Anger was expressed by those who were looking forward to visiting the cities. “What a mess! Now I have to pay a full price!” one person posted on social media. Another wrote: “Ouch! I’ve already booked an expensive trip.” Many would-be travelers have started the rebooking process and are searching for cheaper accommodations. Others criticized the government’s logic. “But traveling from the excluded areas is OK, right?” a person commented on a social networking site. “It makes no sense at all.” Another wrote, “Traveling to there is bad, but traveling from there is fine. Why?” A 40-year-old company employee in Yokohama has booked a hotel in Osaka for a family trip during the New Year holidays. She now does not know what to do about the vacation plan. “The government should have set a standard for a rule change like this and explained it,” she said. “The government has been one step behind on everything, and people have been forced to run around in confusion. It’s such a waste of taxpayers’ money.” The government has been urging the public to take extra precautions against infections of the novel coronavirus, but at the same time continues to entice people to travel around the country with offers of steep discounts under the Go To Travel campaign to prop up the struggling tourism industry. Health experts have said the tourism promotion program is contributing to the rising number of infections. The tourism ministry’s website on Nov. 13 said the Go To Travel campaign has risks attached, and operation guidelines may change depending on the pandemic situation in the targeted areas. It also urges travel agencies, booking website operators and others to “explain the risks thoroughly to tourists.” The website did little to prevent a flood of inquiries from customers who have already made travel plans to Osaka or Sapporo. A staff member of a major travel company said stressed customers have repeatedly asked, “What is going to happen to my trip?” and “What happens if I cancel my plan?” “We thought we explained the central government’s guideline to customers, but we have to admit the possibility that they did not understand it,” the employee said. The exclusion of inbound trips to Sapporo and Osaka from the campaign could have a ripple effect, and people might start canceling their trips to other areas, the staff member said. Hoshino Resorts Inc., an operator of pricy hotels nationwide, on Nov. 21 notified people who have booked rooms through its official website that they can stay for the discounted price even if the campaign is suspended in those areas. “We sent email to ease our customers’ concerns. We will see what the government will do and discuss what to do,” a company representative said.

The latest count more than doubled in three weeks from the 163 cases confirmed as of Nov. 1. A total of 18,019 patients were hospitalized for COVID-19 nationwide as of Nov. 22 with the number of those with severe symptoms up by eight from the day before to 331, according to data released by the health ministry on Nov. 23. The data also shows the number of severe cases has continued rising since Nov. 1 and reached 272 on Nov. 16. The figure topped the 259 logged on Aug. 23, the highest during the second wave of infections. The death toll from the virus for the month of November also hit 208 as of Nov. 21, already exceeding the 195 recorded for October. During the current third wave of infections, severe cases and elderly patients account for a larger portion of total COVID-19 cases, compared to the second wave, when many patients were young and had mild or no symptoms. If the number of severely ill patients keeps rising, it could force hospitals to cut back on treating patients with other diseases, such as accepting emergency patients and performing surgeries, given their limited capacity to accept severe cases.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/13958081

Iwate had prided itself as the last prefecture in Japan with zero novel coronavirus infections, but its first case was confirmed in late August, and it now has 141 total infections. The figure in Tokyo further plummeted on Nov. 23, but Mondays typically have lower numbers in the capital because they reflect days when fewer people get tested. The tally in Osaka Prefecture also dropped, to below 300 for the first time since Nov. 18. However, Osaka Governor Hirofumi Yoshimura said on a television program on Nov. 23 that he will ask the central government to suspend the Go To Travel campaign in the city of Osaka, where infections have surged recently.

But in Tokyo and elsewhere, crowds were much thinner than usual. Leafy and mountainous Hakone in Kanagawa Prefecture and Arashiyama, a nationally designated historic site and place of scenic beauty in Kyoto Prefecture, reported two- and four-fold increases in visitors, respectively, compared with the holiday average before the crisis. However, the northernmost main island of Hokkaido, where novel coronavirus infections have surged in recent weeks, along with major train stations in large cities, were spared a massive influx of visitors. Estimates of people traveling were provided by Agoop Corp., a Softbank Corp. subsidiary that utilizes positional information on smartphone users. Agoop's data showed that the number of visitors to Hakone-Yumoto, a gateway to the Hakone hot spring resort, rose by 95.6 percent during the course of an hour from 3 p.m. on Nov. 21, compared with the same period on holiday averages between Jan. 18 and Feb. 14. The Arashiyama district, a renowned tourist destination in Kyoto, registered an increase of 280.4 percent. Compared with the holiday average in November 2019, when the disease was still unknown, Hakone-Yumoto had a 43.4-percent rise in visitors and Arashiyama an increase of 11.1 percent. Prior to the three-day holiday period, the Japan Medical Association urged the public to refrain from going out due to spikes in case counts in many parts of the country. The government, alarmed by the surge of new cases, said Nov. 21 it will partially review its “Go To Travel” campaign, a program that subsidizes travel costs to shore up the tourism industry ravaged by the pandemic. Those move prompted a flurry of cancellations of reservations for hotel rooms in popular tourist areas and smaller crowds than usual at major train stations near shopping or entertainment districts. For example, Shibuya Center-Gai, the central hub for youth culture in Tokyo’s Shibuya Ward, reported a visitor decline of 29.7 percent.

0,Imperial couple reach out to health care workers online,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"November 22, 2020 at 14:22 JST"," With the novel coronavirus pandemic barring direct engagement with people, Emperor Naruhito and Empress Masako are switching their interactions with the public in a manner picture-perfect for the pandemic. On Nov. 18, the imperial couple held a videoconference with health care workers at various hospitals around Japan dealing with the pandemic. From the Akasaka Imperial Residence in Tokyo, Naruhito and Masako watched and conversed with doctors and nurses in such areas as northern Hokkaido and Okinawa Prefecture in the south using a 50-inch monitor. Imperial Household Agency officials said it was the first time the emperor and empress used an online system to interact with the public. The session began with Yukio Honma, head of the Japanese Red Cross Medical Center, based in Tokyo’s Shibuya Ward. He explained how his hospital was treating COVID-19 patients. The medical center is one of the medical institutions designated specifically to handle the novel coronavirus. According to Hiroki Tomita, a vice president of the Japanese Red Cross Society, Naruhito told Masako that the display gave him the impression those he was speaking to were right in front of him. Doctors and nurses from three hospitals affiliated with the Japanese Red Cross Society spoke with the imperial couple through the videoconferencing system. The hospitals were located in Hokkaido, Fukushima Prefecture and Okinawa. The imperial couple expressed their deep respect for the various activities carried out so far by the health care professionals. Masako also said she was worried about the difficulties facing those working on the front lines of the pandemic. Imperial Household Agency officials said the imperial couple had long indicated their desire to thank those treating COVID-19 patients. But as having them visit a hospital in person would have burdened the staff, it was decided to hold the videoconference. Initially, agency officials were less than enthusiastic about using online systems. with one high-ranking official saying, “It is important for the emperor and empress to directly meet with and talk to people to ensure that their thoughts are passed on."" But the prolonged pandemic has led to the cancellation of a wide range of activities attended by the imperial couple, including annual events such as the National Arbor Day Festival and the National Sports Festival. Naruhito also postponed a planned visit to Britain that would have been his first overseas trip since ascending the Chrysanthemum Throne. With few opportunities to interact with the public, the decision was made to go online. But various issues have to be overcome to expand such interactions. For one thing, the other party must have a sufficient internet environment to allow for videoconferences, including proper computer security measures. “We will try various ways to use online systems after determining its effectiveness in various situations and also to ensure that an excessive burden is not placed on the other party,” a high-ranking agency official said. Hideya Kawanishi, an associate professor of history at Nagoya University who has conducted research on the imperial system, welcomed the introduction of online technology for the imperial couple. He pointed out that during the Heisei Era (1989-2019), Emperor Emeritus Akihito and Empress Emerita Michiko were considered to have a personal connection with the public because of their emphasis on going to where people were. Kawanishi said Naruhito and Masako could create a new catalyst for engaging with the public through the use of online systems to reach out to them.

He told a Nov. 21 meeting of officials to discuss further measures to prevent a spread of COVID-19 that the government “will introduce a measure to temporarily stop taking new reservations under the Go To Travel campaign for destinations where infections are on the rise.” Suga added that for areas where infections are spreading at a certain pace, “We will take that into consideration and cooperate with prefectural governors to implement stronger measures.” He said he would also ask prefectural governors to take measures to scale back on sales of coupons or use of points in the Go To Eat dining out program. The Go To Travel program started in July when Suga still served as chief Cabinet secretary. He explained in the Diet on Nov. 20 that about 40 million people had used the campaign and so far 176 travelers had been confirmed with COVID-19. While the Go To Travel program was a symbolic measure to prop up the economy during the pandemic, the Japan Medical Association and the Tokyo Medical Association in recent days had lobbied for it to be suspended, saying it served as a catalyst for more infections. The government’s panel of experts on Nov. 20 also requested that the campaign be reviewed in light of record numbers of daily COVID-19 cases.

Lines of passengers formed for Shinkansen bullet trains at JR Tokyo Station from early morning. One family of five was waiting for a train to take them to Hakodate in Hokkaido, the main northern island, which is witnessing a sharp increase in new coronavirus infections with the colder weather. “It would have been a waste to have to pay cancellation fees and we decided to go ahead with the trip after having a family discussion,” said the woman in her 40s traveling with her husband, two children and mother. She also said they would not forget to wear face masks and disinfect their hands while making the most out of their trip. Government officials were to meet later Nov. 21 to discuss whether to revise the Go To Travel tourism promotion campaign. The woman’s husband said the government was slow in acting if it intended to make a decision after the three-day weekend had already started.

Panel members expressed alarm at a sharp spike in cases around the nation in recent days during a Nov. 20 meeting in Tokyo. They urged the government to take urgent steps to prevent a further spread of infections, especially to and from areas where new cases are spiraling out of control. On Nov. 20, authorities nationwide confirmed a record 2,426 new cases. Records were broken in Hokkaido, the northernmost main island, with 304 new cases and bustling Osaka Prefecture with 370 cases. Tokyo also reported 522 cases, the second straight day the figure exceeded 500. Until now, the experts’ panel had remained cautious about implementing measures that might lead to a slowdown in economic activity. But it is now unable to ignore the recent sharp upswing. Members noted during the Nov. 20 meeting that some areas were approaching the second highest stage 3 in terms of various benchmarks related to the new coronavirus. Yasutoshi Nishimura, the state minister in charge of economic revitalization who is in charge of dealing with the health scare, said at a news conference following the panel meeting that government officials dealing with the pandemic would meet again on Nov. 21 to discuss further measures. The panel’s recommendations include having prefectures where large numbers of new infections have occurred to implement a range of measures over a three-week period to bring the situation under control. Those steps include asking restaurants that serve alcohol to shorten their business hours or temporarily close their doors. The panel also called on the central government to provide fiscal support to help businesses that cooperate with the requests from prefectural governments. Under the panel’s four stage classification, prefectures in stage 3 have a sharp increase in new infections and prefectural authorities in those jurisdictions are called on to ask local restaurants and bars to shorten business hours. A stage 4 area means that central and prefectural governments should consider stronger steps, such as declaring a state of emergency and ordering residents to remain at home. In September, the experts’ panel said the Go To Travel and Go To Eat consumption promotion campaigns could be implemented in prefectures that were at stage 2 or under. While all prefectures had been considered at stage 2 or under, some areas, such as Hokkaido and Tokyo, experienced sharp increases in November and some of the six benchmarks used by the panel to help determine what stage an area is in had exceeded levels for stage 3. As it is up to each prefectural governor to determine the stage his or her jurisdiction is in, deeper discussions on measures to take never materialized. The panel’s recommendation did not specify which prefectures were considered at the equivalent of stage 3, but during a subsequent news conference, Shigeru Omi, the panel chair, indicated that the areas of concern to the panel were Tokyo, Osaka, Aichi and Hokkaido.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/13950804

However, unlike the second wave of infections this summer, Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike at a news conference on Nov. 19 did not ask people to refrain from traveling outside of the capital unless absolutely necessary or request restaurants and karaoke parlors serving alcohol to reduce their operating hours. Tokyo officials are concerned about the impact on economic activities from such a request, and have assessed that hospitals in the capital still have room to handle more COVID-19 patients, according to sources. Tokyo reported a daily record 493 new cases on Nov. 18, after the seven-day moving average of newly confirmed infections exceeded 300 since Nov. 15. On Nov. 19, 534 new infections were confirmed in the capital, setting a new high for the second straight day. The decision to raise the alert level came after a meeting between metropolitan officials and experts on infectious diseases in the afternoon. At the meeting, Koike underlined the need for people to take thorough precautionary measures against the virus, particularly with the season of year-end and New Year’s parties approaching. “I urge people to limit the number of attendees and the duration of the parties to avoid airborne droplets carrying the virus,” she said. “The parties should be held at places with sufficient ventilation, and attendees should maintain proper distance and avoid sitting across from each other.” Touching on the spike in new cases involving senior citizens, Koike called on elderly people and those with pre-existing conditions to refrain from eating in groups due to their heightened risk of developing serious symptoms. She also asked relatives living with people in those risk groups to avoid gatherings as much as possible as a precaution. During her appearance on a TV news program the previous day, Koike said the metropolitan government needs to envisage a daily count of 1,000 new cases and take appropriate countermeasures. The metropolitan government had asked businesses to curtail operations during the second wave of new infections this summer. The alert level was set to 4 on July 15 and was lowered to 3 on Sept. 10. The daily counts had not dropped noticeably in Tokyo and plateaued more or less through October. But the capital logged 317 new infections on Nov. 11, the first time for the count to exceed the 300 threshold since Aug. 20, when 339 new patients were reported. The daily number of new cases had since hovered between 250 and 400, except for Nov. 16, when 180 new cases were confirmed. Koike told reporters on the evening of Nov. 18 that she expects further increases in new cases in the coming weeks. “Our basic approach is containing the number of serious cases,” she said, referring to COVID-19 patients requiring ventilators or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) lung bypass machines.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/13944350

A daily record 2,202 new novel coronavirus infections were confirmed nationwide as of 9:30 p.m. on Nov. 18, the first time the tally has exceeded 2,000. Suga asked the public to thoroughly take basic measures to prevent infections, such as wearing masks and avoiding the “three Cs” of closed, crowded and close-contact settings. He also asked people to have “silent meals with masks” by keeping the facial coverings on during conversations and removing them only for eating and drinking, citing the high infection risks pointed out by experts. “I will also do so myself,” he said. Suga said he instructed Yasutoshi Nishimura, the state minister of economic revitalization who is also in charge of Japan’s response to the pandemic, and health minister Norihisa Tamura to implement additional measures to curb the spread of COVID-19. Those measures will be discussed by the health ministry’s advisory board on Nov. 19 and by the government’s subcommittee on Nov. 20. Despite the recent surge in infections, the government has shown no indication that it will end its “Go To” programs aimed at stirring economic activity in struggling sectors. At a news conference on Nov. 18, Toshio Nakagawa, president of the Japan Medical Association, said “there is no doubt” that the Go To Travel campaign “triggered” the sharp increase in new infections in recent days. Reporters asked the prime minister if he intends to review the government’s Go To Travel campaign, which encourages domestic travel to help the pandemic-battered tourism industry. Suga left the prime minister's office without responding to the question. Tokyo confirmed a record 493 new infections on Nov. 18. Kanagawa, Saitama, Nagano and Shizuoka prefectures also reported their highest daily figures.

0,Hokkaido raises alert level to contain spike in COVID-19 cases,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"November 17, 2020 at 18:52 JST"," SAPPORO--The governor of Hokkaido and the mayor of Sapporo, the main northern island's capital, agreed to implement measures equivalent to stage 4 of the new coronavirus alert level for the city to help contain soaring cases of COVID-19. The entire island, including Sapporo, will remain at the stage 3 designation under Hokkaido's original five-point scale that is in place. But the Hokkaido and Sapporo city governments have decided to take strengthened anti-coronavirus measures for Sapporo. The decision was made during emergency talks between Governor Naomichi Suzuki and Mayor Katsuhiro Akimoto on Nov. 16. A formal announcement that urged residents to remain indoors as much as possible was announced Nov. 17. Residents living outside of Sapporo were also requested to refrain from visiting the city. In situations where the risk of becoming infected is unavoidable, residents were asked to follow the requests unless it is absolutely urgent. “Our health care system is bearing a much heavier burden due to the increase in infections, and I am very concerned about the situation,” Suzuki told reporters on Nov. 16. The Hokkaido prefectural and Sapporo city governments are desperate to avoid a knock-on effect that damages the overall island economy while maintaining a stage 3 level for the entire area. Another issue discussed was the “Go To Travel” subsidy campaign promoted by the central government to mitigate the impact on the national economy due to the health crisis. Suzuki and Akimoto requested people living in other parts of Japan to refrain from visiting Sapporo “if the risk of infection is unavoidable.” They offered specific examples of those unavoidable risks on Nov. 17, such as using facilities where anti-infection measures are not fully implemented or meeting in closed indoor settings for long periods. With regard to the government's “Go To Eat” campaign, it was agreed that residents should be urged to eat out only in groups of four or less and to finish their meal within two hours. Those measures are not mandatory. The number of new COVID-19 cases has been surging in Hokkaido, a popular tourist destination, since late October. Hokkaido reported 189 new cases on Nov. 16 and Sapporo confirmed 124 cases. (This article was written by Ichiro Matsuo, Toru Saito and Fumiko Yoshigaki.)",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/13938152
1,Suga seeks to break up large parties in ‘Go To Eat’ campaign,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"November 17, 2020 at 18:38 JST"," Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga urged governors in COVID-19 hotspots to limit the size of groups that use the “Go To Eat” campaign, which is designed to encourage more people to dine outside. “I ask governors to consider excluding dining parties of five or more people, for example, from the Go To Eat campaign’s point and meal coupon programs,” Suga said at a Nov. 16 meeting of the government task force dealing with the novel coronavirus pandemic. The governors of Hokkaido and Osaka Prefecture, where COVID-19 cases have been surging, have pleaded for limits in the government-subsidized campaign that is intended to support bars and restaurants hit hard by the pandemic. The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries said it would be desirable to implement the prime minister’s requested measures in areas with rising cases starting on Nov. 21, the first day of a three-day weekend. Groups of five or more can still benefit from the campaign, but they will have to split up so that only up to four of them use one room or table. They could also use partitions to maintain a proper physical distance from each other, according to the ministry. Suga’s request is based on the view of the government subcommittee consisting of infectious disease experts that dining in a group of five or more people raises the risk of infections, the ministry said. One of the Go To Eat campaign’s programs that started in October rewards diners with points that they can later spend like cash at registered restaurants. Parties of up to 10 people can receive the points per meal when they use 13 designated reservation websites. The government set aside 61.6 billion yen ($589 million) for the program, but the budget will likely dry up soon because of a surge in reservations since late October. Most of the major booking websites have stopped accepting new reservations for the points program since Nov. 14, and the rest will likely follow suit within days. However, 90 percent of the points awarded to users of the program have yet to be spent. The points can be used until March next year. The government expects more people will use premium meal coupons offered under another program of the Go To Eat campaign from December, prompting its request to governors to consider imposing limits on group sizes. The government maintains that its Go To programs, including the “Go To Travel” campaign aimed at revitalizing the struggling tourism industry, have not fueled the spread of the novel coronavirus. “We do not believe the Go To programs themselves became sources of infections,” said Yasutoshi Nishimura, the state minister of economic revitalization who is also in charge of the government’s response to the pandemic. But the nation’s daily new infections set three consecutive records until Nov. 14. Local governments in areas outside of major cities are also increasingly alarmed by the recent increase in new cases, forcing the central government to partially review the Go To programs. Suga on Nov. 16 also announced plans to provide a 50-billion-yen subsidy to municipalities to financially support businesses that have complied with their requests to shorten operating hours to curb the spread of the virus. The central government has earmarked 3 trillion yen in its budget for temporary subsidies to support local governments’ response to the pandemic, including bolstering their health care systems and maintaining employment. The government will use some of the remaining budget funds to pay the 50-billion-yen subsidy. But the National Governors’ Association has said the planned subsidy amount is not enough.

0,Mutated strain of new coronavirus more infectious than Wuhan type,['By KENTA NOGUCHI/ Staff Writer'],"November 13, 2020 at 19:15 JST"," The mutating new coronavirus now ravaging Europe and the United States is far more infectious than the original strain that flared in Wuhan and threw the central China city into a months-long ""lockdown,"" a study shows. Research led by Yoshihiro Kawaoka, a professor of virology at the University of Tokyo’s Institute of Medical Science, and Ralph Baric, a professor of epidemiology at the University of North Carolina in the United States, announced their findings in the U.S. magazine Science on Nov. 13. The initial outbreak was confined to Wuhan, but quickly began spreading globally. As it evolved, the D614G-type virus, where the spike protein on the virus surface mutated, spread much wider than the original strain. This mutated version has been spreading in Japan since March. Researchers have been unable to figure out how the mutation influences the characteristics of the virus. The team artificially synthesized the original virus and the mutated type in laboratory conditions to study the degree of infectability on hamsters, which can develop pneumonia, just as when humans are found to have a serious case of COVID-19. The team members matched a coronavirus-infected hamster with a non-infected rodent and reared them in different cages next to each other. This prevented the hamsters from having physical contact but the distance is close enough for the virus to spread. The team then placed eight pairs each using the original-type virus and the mutated-type and observed them for about a week. For the pairs with the mutated-type virus, in five cases the virus emerged in the noses of the non-infected hamsters just two days after the experiment started. The infections occurred two days earlier than those with the original-type. “We were able to confirm that only one mutation can change the virus characteristics to increase infectability,” Kawaoka said.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/13927621

0,Study: Infection clusters can be avoided at nearly full stadiums,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"November 13, 2020 at 18:15 JST"," Proper measures can mitigate the spread of the novel coronavirus in near-capacity baseball stadiums, according to a study, but the government will extend its crowd restrictions at such large venues into next year. The study report was presented at the government’s subcommittee on dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic on Nov. 12. A trial run of sharply increasing attendance started at the end of October for professional baseball games at Yokohama Stadium in Kanagawa Prefecture to test the effectiveness of anti-virus measures. The project was planned when the government was considering a further easing in December of entry restrictions for large events. During the three-game series, 51 to 86 percent of the 32,000 or so stadium seats available for the games were filled, but no cluster infections have been reported since then, according to the interim report. “It is possible to create an environment to prevent infections (at baseball stadiums),” the report concluded. During the trial run, high-definition cameras and equipment that can measure CO2 levels were set up at the stadium to check for any infection risk. The monitoring also showed that the use of face masks was more likely when attendance increased. Toilets sometimes became crowded, but proper ventilation kept the air circulating to remove possible contagious airborne particles, the report said. Staggering the entry and exit of spectators also helped to reduce crowd congestion, according to the report. The report pointed to a need to create a system to check fans’ health conditions beforehand because some who watched the games said they felt unwell in questionnaires filled out upon entering the stadium. Despite the report’s optimistic outlook, the subcommittee on Nov. 12 approved the government’s plan to maintain crowd restrictions at large events until the end of February, given the recent surge in new COVID-19 cases around the nation. Under those restrictions, only half of the seats at venues with a capacity exceeding 10,000 can be filled. However, entry restrictions for movie theaters will be lifted in December, according to sources. The subcommittee also compiled a list of measures to prevent infections at shrines and temples on New Year’s Day, when hordes of people are expected to visit the sites to make wishes for the coming year. The measures include urging people to stagger their visits and to refrain from consuming food and drinks on the grounds of the shrines and temples.

1,"Japan has over 24,000 facilities ready to test for the flu, COVID-19",['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"November 13, 2020 at 17:00 JST"," Anyone with a high fever in Japan can now get tested for the novel coronavirus and seasonal influenza at 24,629 facilities nationwide, the health ministry announced on Nov. 12. But experts wonder if the number is enough. Anticipating a simultaneous outbreak of COVID-19 and seasonal influenza in the winter season, the ministry had asked local governments to designate facilities that can handle medical examinations and testing by the end of October. Tokyo leads the pack, with 3,000. Iwate Prefecture has the least, with 114. Local governments estimate possible demand for testing at the peak of an outbreak would be 460,568 per day--68,325 tests for the novel coronavirus and 392,243 tests for seasonal influenza. Whether the names of such facilities are disclosed publicly is up to each government to decide. Many governments have kept the names undisclosed or only partially disclosed, citing that publicly naming them would attract too many patients and reputations of hospitals that conduct the tests could be damaged by false rumors. Under the new system, people experiencing a high fever are asked to call their family doctor or a consulting center established by each local government. Local governments and health care institutions share the list of designated facilities. Patients will get a referral to such facility after calling their family doctor or other medical professional. But the number of facilities does not bode well for ensuring smooth operations. “Some health care institutions handle such inquires 24/7, but others do it on a rotating schedule,” a ministry official said. “We can’t make an evaluation just by looking at the numbers. But at least as of now, each local government has made the designation,"" the official noted. Experts and health care workers have pointed out the system faces a number of challenges, however. “It isn't enough,” said Toru Kakuta, vice chairman of the Tokyo Medical Association. The Tokyo metropolitan government has designated 3,000 facilities for testing. But the number remains small, considering that there are approximately 8,000 general internal medicine clinics in the capital. Up to about 64,000 tests a day will be needed if an outbreak of seasonal influenza and the novel coronavirus occurs at the same time, according to one estimate. Calculated simply, each of the 3,000 facilities will have to handle 20 or so tests a day. If patients rush to designated facilities, the testing process will likely slow. Nakata Clinic in Tokyo’s Chiyoda Ward, one of the designated facilities, has done a partial interior renovation to prepare for a simultaneous outbreak of the novel coronavirus and seasonal influenza. The clinic said it received advice from infectious disease experts on the flow of staff and patients to lower the risk of infection. It conducted a test on 30 patients who developed a high fever during the two-month period until October. All patients had called the clinic before coming to take the test, staff said. Two tested positive for the novel coronavirus. One had symptoms of pneumonia and was unable to eat. The clinic performed a simple test, confirmed they were infected with the virus and called a public health center. A doctor of the clinic concluded that the patients needed to be hospitalized immediately and made the arrangements. “In a normal situation, making arrangements for hospitalization is a public health center’s job,” said Koichiro Nakata, the director of the hospital. Nakata fears the process of making the arrangements will become “clogged” if the number of patients rises and public health centers are overwhelmed by calls and requests from multiple health care facilities. “Our clinic has limited space and we won’t be able to take care of other patients if a public health center can’t immediately find a hospital or accommodation for a patient,” Nakata said.

0,Suga stays the ‘Go To’ course after COVID-19 cases hit record,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"November 13, 2020 at 15:55 JST"," Troubling trends are emerging regarding the record-setting surge in new COVID-19 cases that has fueled debate between health experts and government officials on whether to issue another state of emergency. Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga on Nov. 13 told reporters he was not prepared to declare a state of emergency, adding that the government’s Go To campaigns to stimulate tourism and consumption would not be reviewed at the current time. The previous day, 1,662 new COVID-19 cases were reported around the nation, exceeding the earlier daily record of 1,607 set on Aug. 7. The ratio of newly infected elderly people, who are more prone to developing severe symptoms, has been increasing in the latest resurgence. And hospital beds used for treating COVID-19 patients are filling up to disturbing levels in some prefectures. Shigeru Omi, chairman of the government panel of experts, said on Nov. 12 that now was “the last chance” to take measures to restrain a further spread of novel coronavirus infections. Kiyoshi Nagase, president of the Hokkaido Medical Association, also raised the alarm even before the nationwide record number was tallied on Nov. 12. “We have entered a third wave of infections,” Nagase said at a news conference earlier in the day. “Depending on the circumstances, I hope serious thought is given toward reviewing the Go To programs.” However, Yasutoshi Nishimura, the state minister in charge of economic revitalization who is the government’s point man in dealing with the health scare, also said the current situation did not warrant another state of emergency. Although Nishimura said “the trend is moving toward a large wave,” he stopped short of using the term “third wave.” Hokkaido on Nov. 12 reported a record high 236 new COVID-19 cases, fueling calls for its removal from the government’s Go To Travel campaign that subsidizes domestic travel around the country. But the economy of the northern main island depends largely on tourism. Osamu Shimada, president of Hokkaido Railway Co., said the effects from the Go To programs for traveling and dining out had been large and hoped that they would continue for the time being. According to the health ministry, 7 percent of beds in Hokkaido hospitals devoted to treating COVID-19 patients were filled in mid-October. But over the past month, 54 percent of such hospital beds were in use, figures compiled by The Asahi Shimbun showed. That is more than double the 25-percent benchmark set by the central government for raising the alert level to stage 3, when a surge of infections is occurring and preparations should be made for declaring a state of emergency. Osaka Prefecture has also seen a sharp increase in the use of hospital beds, with capacity over the past month exceeding 30 percent. In Tokyo, 41 percent of the hospital beds were filled. Patients in younger age brackets accounted for a large percentage of new cases during the second wave of infections in the summer. But seniors are now increasingly being confirmed infected. In Tokyo, 7.3 percent of new COVID-19 patients during the week until Aug. 10 were 65 and older. The ratio increased to 13.5 percent in the week until Nov. 9. In Osaka Prefecture, those 60 and older accounted for 13 percent of all new cases between July 26 and Aug. 8 at the peak of the second wave, but the figure doubled to 26 percent for the Nov. 1-10 period. The ratio of positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and other tests has also been rising in various areas. In Hokkaido, the ratio was 10.3 percent while Aichi Prefecture, where Nagoya is located, had a 9.2 percent positive rate. An increase in the positive rate may mean that the scale of infections in a given area cannot be accurately assessed because testing is not keeping pace with actual infections. Norio Omagari, director of the Disease Control and Prevention Center under the National Center for Global Health and Medicine, said Tokyo was nearing a point where the alert level should be raised to the highest red level. Omagari, a member of the Tokyo metropolitan government’s panel of experts, said he was particularly concerned by the sharp increase in new cases in recent weeks. The daily average in new cases for the week ending on Nov. 11 was about 244, a 47.7 percent increase over the previous week when the daily average was about 165. Omagari said if that trend continued, the daily average in four weeks’ time would reach about 1,160. “Some people may think that figure is too large or that it is some kind of fantasy, but a similar situation occurred in the summer, and there was a sharp increase in patients based on those weekly figures,” Omagari said.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/13927108

0,Soba chain staff asked to falsify work hours to get COVID-19 grant,['By SATORU EGUCHI/ Staff Writer'],"November 12, 2020 at 19:13 JST"," Staff at a soba noodle stand chain were asked to falsify attendance records so the company could qualify for a government subsidy program for COVID-19 relief, according to sources. A company executive at Tokyo-based Daitan Dish, which oversees the operation of the Nadai Fuji Soba chain, asked staff to report some of the days they worked as taking leave in their time sheets, the sources said. Daitan Dish is one of the Daitan group companies, which operate more than 100 noodle stands of the soba chain in the Tokyo metropolitan area. The issue came to light after an employee raised concerns that following such instructions could result in the chain operator fraudulently applying for the government’s subsidy program for maintaining employment. Businesses can receive the subsidy if they retained employees who had to take leave due to the novel coronavirus pandemic by paying them allowances instead of firing them. A source in the operator admitted that the executive gave the directions but said that the company did not fraudulently apply for or receive the subsidy since it corrected the practices after being alerted about them. A Daitan Dish executive sent an email in mid-May to some of the staff, asking them not to punch their timecards two days a week because the executive wanted to treat their attendance on those days as “special leave,” according to sources in Daitan Dish. The company referred to leave that makes it eligible for the subsidy program as “special leave,” the sources said. The executive also told the staff in the email that they didn't need to come to work on those days if they were doing what they were supposed to do by working from home or at their noodle stands. But a source who was given the instructions said, “I was busier than usual at the time to deal with shortened operating hours and taking measures against infections, so I worked every day on weekdays.” In early June, when the chain fully resumed late-night operations, the executive emailed those working at noodle stands operated by two staff to report days that one of their pairs worked as taking leave. “If you are worried about operating your stand alone, your pair is asked to report to work while on special leave,” the executive wrote in the email. An employee who received the instructions notified another executive in the Daitan group of the request, saying Daitan Dish could end up fraudulently receiving the subsidy if staff followed the instructions, according to Daitan Holdings, which manages the Daitan group companies. After learning of the matter, Daitan Dish stopped treating its staff’s attendance as special leave when they were actually at work. It applied for the subsidy program in August by submitting staff attendance records that were corrected to delete the bogus special leave, according to a source in the company. “We prevented ourselves from fraudulently applying for the subsidy,” Daitan Holdings told The Asahi Shimbun. “But we take seriously the fact that directions that could lead to such fraud were given to our staff and offer our apologies.”",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/13924574

Hokkaido reported 236 new cases, including 164 in Sapporo, the capital and largest city on the northernmost main island, local government officials said. The Hokkaido figure shattered the previous record of 200 new cases set on Nov. 9 and represented the eighth straight day for the daily tally to exceed 100. Hyogo Prefecture confirmed 81 new cases on Nov. 12, breaking the previous record of 70 set the day earlier. Prefectural government officials said they feared the upward trend will continue. The Nov. 12 number in Tokyo was 393, the fifth largest since the start of the pandemic and the most since 429 new cases were confirmed on Aug. 8. The previous day, the tally in the capital hit 317, topping 300 for the first time since Aug. 20. The Tokyo metropolitan government said the number of serious cases requiring ventilators or lung bypass machines increased by one from the previous day to 39 on Nov. 12. It also said 104 of the 317 new COVID-19 patients on Nov. 11 showed no symptoms. The metropolitan government on Nov. 12 decided to keep the capital at the second highest level of alert on its four-level scale for the 10th consecutive week. That level requires continued vigilance by the government. Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike told reporters that the rising count is a result of increased testing. “More and more people are taking a test at their own expense these days,” she said. The governor also repeated her warning to the public to take precautions, particularly with the winter season approaching. “Toward the end of the year and the New Year holiday season, we expect people to have more occasions to gather. The risk of infection in such gatherings will likely be high,” Koike said. “I urge (residents) once again to behave in a conscious manner to protect the elderly population and prevent people from developing severe COVID-19 symptoms.” The Hokkaido government on Nov. 7 raised its alert level from two to three on its five-level system. But that apparently did little to contain the spread of the disease. Hokkaido Governor Naomichi Suzuki has emphasized that both economic activities and anti-virus measures be maintained. The central government has contemplated removing Hokkaido from its Go To Travel campaign, which aims to help the tourism industry around the country. But it has kept Hokkaido in the program.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/13924364
1,Doctors say ‘3rd virus wave’ here; limits to remain at sports sites,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"November 12, 2020 at 17:59 JST"," Health experts warned that a third wave of COVID-19 cases is hitting Japan while government officials continued to try to balance economic activities with stricter protocols against the spread of the novel coronavirus. Daily records for new infections were broken on Nov. 11 in Osaka, Saitama, Hyogo, Ibaraki, Niigata, Yamanashi and Iwate prefectures. Overall, 1,547 new COVID-19 cases were reported on that day, the fourth highest daily total for the nation since the pandemic began. “I believe we must think about a third wave,” Toshio Nakagawa, president of the Japan Medical Association, said at a news conference on Nov. 11. He said the situation in Tokyo was particularly serious, with the capital reporting 317 new cases on Nov. 11, the first time since August that the single-day figure exceeded 300. An advisory panel to the health ministry on Nov. 11 also expressed concerns about the surge in new cases, citing infection clusters in entertainment districts, workplaces and foreign communities in various locations. The panel called for additional measures to deal with infection clusters to prevent medical facilities from being overwhelmed by COVID-19 patients, and to remind the public to wear face masks and wash their hands to block the spread of the contagion. Takaji Wakita, the head of the National Institute of Infectious Diseases, who chairs the advisory panel, was asked if the government’s Go To Travel campaign to promote tourism was exacerbating the health crisis. “While attention has focused on the Go To program, the main cause for pushing up infections is overall economic and social activities,” Wakita said. Nakagawa, however, suggested that Hokkaido be removed from the tourism program if there are signs of a sharp increase in cases in the main northern island. Government sources said restrictions on attendance at large events will remain in place until the end of February. Those limits were scheduled to be eased in December. Under the prolonged restrictions, only half of the seats can be filled for sporting events at venues with a capacity in excess of 10,000. For venues with capacity under 10,000, up to 5,000 people can attend. The government had been gradually relaxing the crowd restrictions after lifting the state of emergency for the pandemic in May. But the recent resurgence of infections has ended that trend for large venues, the sources said. However, restrictions for movie theaters will likely be lifted. The government had asked that only half of the seats be filled at theaters that sell popcorn. But such theaters will be allowed to fill all seats because customers who consume popcorn are less likely to engage in conversation during the movies, the sources said. A study showed that airborne droplets only spread in a limited area when people are eating and not talking. SENSE OF CRISIS UP NORTH The infection clusters in Hokkaido and the northern prefecture of Aomori are hampering public services and threatening already overloaded medical care systems. The sense of unease within the city government of Sapporo, the Hokkaido capital, was exacerbated by reports of clusters emerging in medical facilities that provide advanced levels of care. On Nov. 10, Sapporo reported four clusters, including one at the National Hospital Organization Hokkaido Medical Center. Thorough measures to prevent a spread of infections were believed to have been in place at the medical center, but nine nurses and three patients there have been confirmed with COVID-19. Infection clusters have also hit the Susukino entertainment district in Sapporo, a retirement home, a university club and a trading company. A total of eight workers at three post offices in Sapporo were also confirmed infected, leading to a temporary halt in operations at those facilities. Aomori Prefecture had confirmed only 36 COVID-19 cases in total as of the end of September. But over the next month, the number increased sevenfold to 275. One catalyst was an infection cluster originating in a restaurant and bar in Hirosaki. After a doctor who visited the establishment was confirmed infected on Oct. 12, infections spread to family members and colleagues as well as others in the city. About 180 cases have been linked to the restaurant and bar. The infections have put a heavy burden on hospitals in the area. About 30 percent of the 201 hospital beds in Aomori Prefecture capable of caring for those with COVID-19 were filled. The figure exceeded the 25-percent benchmark used by the central government’s panel of experts to classify an area as being at the second highest alert level for the novel coronavirus.

1,Winter is coming: Suga calls for ways to halt virus surge,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"November 11, 2020 at 17:22 JST"," Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga called for heightened government measures to contain novel coronavirus cluster infections and to urge the public to take precautions after new COVID-19 cases steadily rose in many parts of Japan. At a government task force meeting on Nov. 10, Suga also said the scale of testing should widen considerably in regions where new cases are surging. The government’s intensified efforts are aimed at curbing infections at an early stage as the proliferation of both flu and COVID-19 is feared possible in winter. “Given that the national total of single-day new cases has topped 1,000 on some days, we need to deal with the pandemic with the utmost vigilance,” Suga said. “The government should work at full force to allow social and economic activities as well as measures to slow the spread of the virus to keep going as we prepare for winter.” His comment followed a set of urgent anti-virus measures recommended the previous day by a government panel of experts on infectious diseases and the economy. The panel pressed for further efforts to contain cluster infections, to get people to understand that drinking parties carry an enormous risk of spreading infections, and to ensure that countermeasures are in place at various venues, including restaurants and workplaces. The prime minister also told the task force meeting that the occupancy rate of hospital beds for COVID-19 patients remains roughly 30 percent, even in regions where outbreaks were reported. After the task force meeting, Yasutoshi Nishimura, minister in charge of economic revitalization who is also in charge of the government’s response to the novel coronavirus pandemic, underlined the importance of taking action now to keep the disease under control. “We need to implement measures at this stage to prevent a situation that requires the declaration of a state of emergency,” he said, alluding to the one that was declared in April. Since October, the daily count of new infections has increased in Tokyo, Hokkaido and the prefectures of Aichi, Gifu and Osaka. “The number of new infections is clearly increasing,” Osaka Governor Hirofumi Yoshimura said on Nov. 10, when 226 new cases, the highest figure since 255 were reported on Aug. 7, were confirmed in his prefecture. “We are in the third wave.” A sense of alarm was heightened in Hokkaido on Nov. 9, when the daily number of new patients on the northernmost main island reached 200 for the first time. Hokkaido Governor Naomichi Suzuki met with Suga in Tokyo on Nov. 10 to request central government assistance to contain the disease. The prime minister said both governments should fully cooperate to respond to the outbreaks. Also on Nov. 10, Suga instructed his Cabinet ministers to draft requests for a third supplementary budget to finance additional anti-virus measures, economic measures for a post-COVID-19 era, and public works projects designed to mitigate damage from natural disasters. Government officials are expected to expand funding to secure vaccines for the novel coronavirus and grants to assist workers at hospitals and nursing homes. They will also consider providing support to small and midsize companies that will introduce telework as a step against the pandemic, extend the “Go to Travel” campaign to help the tourism industry, and continue providing relief packages for businesses to retain their payrolls.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/13920805
0,COVID-19 pandemic hitting single-parent households hard,['By RYUICHI HISANAGA/ Staff Writer'],"November 11, 2020 at 15:43 JST"," A single father in Nagoya has adopted lifestyle rules and routines to financially survive the COVID-19 pandemic. But he fears the belt-tightening changes will not be enough. The 49-year-old shops at supermarkets in the late afternoon when discount seals are applied to produce. He often makes bulk purchases of pork and freezes the meat he does not immediately use. He tries to limit daily food expenses for himself and his 12-year-old daughter to between 700 yen and 800 yen ($6.70 and $7.60). And he avoids buying leafy vegetables because they tend to spoil quickly. But the pandemic has thrown a number of unforeseen obstacles in his way, costing him his job and disrupting his daughter’s education. His money is running out, and the pandemic shows no signs of ending. Although the government has provided some temporary assistance for single parents, support groups are calling for more measures amid the prolonged health crisis. Hitorioya Shien Kyokai (Single-parent support organization) conducted a special survey from late October to early November on about 1,300 single parents around Japan. A total of 65.6 percent of respondents said their income decreased from last year or was expected to decline. But 79.7 percent of respondents said their expenditures increased from 2019, likely because they had to spend more on utilities and disinfectant alcohol under stay-home measures during the pandemic. As an emergency stop-gap measure, the central government in August began a grant program providing 50,000 yen to single-parent households that met certain conditions. According to the survey, 74.8 percent said they used the grant money for daily expenses or to repay loans, while 15.5 percent said they put the money into a savings account and have used it incrementally for daily expenses. Tomohiro Imai, who heads the support organization, said at a news conference on Nov. 10: “The grants are used up quickly for living expenses. But the pandemic continues so there is a need for continued support measures.” The government , in addition, provides child support grants once every two months for single parents with low incomes. A single child receives 43,160 yen a month, but one condition is that the parent’s income the previous year was under 2.3 million yen. The Nagoya father was ineligible for the grant because his income last year exceeded the limit. He will have to wait until next year to apply. “I want help now,” the man said. “That might help me look forward.” The lives of the father and daughter took a turn for the worse in March, when all schools in Japan closed to prevent the spread of the virus. The daughter has a hearing disability so the father was worried about leaving her alone at home while he went to work. Around that time, he was given a work assignment at a different location. But he knew that he would be unable to reach that location on time after taking his daughter to her special needs school in the morning. He was forced to leave the car sales company he had worked at for 27 years in March. He has been looking for new work while taking care of his daughter, but he was turned down by two companies. His daughter, now in the first year of junior high school, occasionally says she wants to eat beef for a change. He can only tell her that is not possible given their financial situation. He has made do with his severance pay and unemployment benefits. However, the unemployment benefits ran out in November, meaning he will have no income from December. He thinks his savings will run out in March. The Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare estimates there are about 1.42 million single-parent households in Japan. About 80 percent of single mothers work, with an average annual income of 2 million yen. Some of these single parents have lost their jobs because of the pandemic. Both ruling coalition and opposition lawmakers have called for more government grants. But all Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga said at the Nov. 10 Lower House plenary session was, “We will respond to the circumstances facing single parents after grasping the situation they face.”",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/13920658

Sapporo confirmed 158 cases, a record for daily infections in the city. The number of new patients in Hokkaido topped 100 for five days in a row and reached 200 for the first time. The National Hospital Organization Hokkaido Medical Center here announced Nov. 8 that it confirmed eight new cases involving seven nurses and a patient.

0,Minister says getting repeated ‘Go To Eat’ points to eat free is OK,['By TAKAHIRO OKUBO/ Staff Writer'],"November 9, 2020 at 17:30 JST"," A tasty loophole in the ""Go To Eat"" government-subsidized program to support pubs and restaurants is proving that there is such a thing as a free lunch. Hungry users are using the reward points they receive each time to eat their next meal free and then collecting more points atop that freebie. At the Upper House Budget Committee session on Nov. 6, Yasue Funayama, a member of the Democratic Party for the People, asked the government to review the program. “Users can eat meals for free repeatedly” if they take advantage of the system, she said. “This is a government-subsidized program, so it is necessary to give benefits to as many people as possible.” Yasutoshi Nishimura, the minister in charge of economic revitalization, replied that users are not breaking any rules. ""It is permissible to use it in such a way under the program's rules,"" he said. “The current program will reduce the burdens of people in a difficult situation and support drinking and eating establishments."" Under the program, if users make online reservations, eat and pay 1,000 yen ($9.67) or more at eligible establishments, they will receive reward points equaling 1,000 yen. Even if they pay their next meal with those points, they will receive another 1,000 yen in points, which can be used for another free meal and more points. As users can collect and use the points repeatedly without paying anything, posters on the internet have dubbed the practice “the endless loop” or “the alchemy.” The ""Go To Eat"" program was started as part of the measures against the economic downturn caused by the new coronavirus pandemic. Nishimura said despite the apparent loophole, the government has no plans to review the points system. “People can make good use of the program in a legitimate manner,” he said.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/13914462

Hokkaido reported a record 187 new cases on Nov. 7 and the capital of Sapporo confirmed a new high of 141 cases. It was the third straight day Hokkaido has logged more than 100 new COVID-19 cases. Hokkaido authorities convened a meeting of its task force dealing with the health scare on Nov. 7 and decided to raise the alert level to 3. The alert level was raised from 1 to 2 only on Oct. 28. As an initial step, bars and restaurants operating in Susukino, the busiest entertainment district in Sapporo, are being asked to close between 10 p.m. until 5 a.m. if staff are in close contact with customers during the normal course of business hours. The request will be for three weeks until Nov. 27. Hokkaido Governor Naomichi Suzuki and Sapporo Mayor Katsuhiro Akimoto held a news conference on Nov. 7 to explain the new measures and seek the cooperation of Hokkaido residents and visitors. Colder temperatures from late October have led to an increase in the number of COVID-19 cases in Hokkaido. Fifty-one fresh cases were reported on Oct. 23, breaking the previous daily record for the first time in about six months. Even after the alert level was raised to 2, new cases continued to rise, with 119 reported on Nov. 5 and 115 the following day. Several of the seven indicators used by Hokkaido authorities to determine the alert level had already reached levels beyond that for 3 and there were some calls for even stricter measures. H okkaido authorities issued their own state of emergency in late February after COVID-19 cases surged ahead of the national trend. That led to requests for bars and restaurants in Susukino to close . In the three-month period between June and August after the state of emergency was lifted, about 10 percent of the 3,800 or so bars and restaurants in the d istrict had closed, according to the Susukino tourism association. “More businesses will likely close for good,” said an association official. “The vitality of Susukino will not return if infections continue to spread.

The transport ministry on Nov. 4 approved allowing taxi drivers to refuse service to a customer not wearing a mask without good reason. Ten taxi companies in Tokyo applied to the ministry in late August to change the set of rules as a safeguard against the novel coronavirus. Other taxi companies outside Tokyo may follow in their tracks. The ministry said under the new condition, drivers can decline to give a customer a ride if they refuse to explain why they are not wearing a mask or fail to give a good reason for not doing so. If a customer has a legitimate excuse, such as having an illness, and the driver accepts the explanation, then the passenger can enter the vehicle. Taxi companies have added plastic curtains between the driver’s seat and back seat to lower the risk of spreading the virus during the pandemic. But drivers have had difficulty dealing with passengers, particularly drunken ones, who ignore health protocols and continue talking loudly without wearing a mask. Ten companies urged the ministry to allow drivers to decline accepting such fares. Under the Road Transportation Law, the ministry predetermines the conditions of carriage for each taxi operating company. The law has determined that taxi drivers cannot refuse service unless the customer has a new type of influenza or is heavily intoxicated and incapable of walking without support.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/13903253

1,1st cruise ship sails out of Yokohama with special measures,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"November 2, 2020 at 18:58 JST"," A cruise ship with passengers sailed out of Yokohama Port on Nov. 2 for the first time since the novel coronavirus pandemic became rampant in Japan. The 50,444-ton Asuka II, operated by NYK Cruises Co., left its home port in the city of Yokohama at 5 p.m. after having suspended operations for 302 days. The domestic cruise line has resumed operations after suspending scheduled trips due to the pandemic. The Asuka II is scheduled to arrive in Shimizu Port in Shizuoka on the morning of Nov. 4, according to NYK Cruises. It will then sail out on that evening and return to Yokohama Port on the morning of Nov. 5. The ship cruised to Guam and Saipan among other locations from Dec. 26, 2019, to Jan. 5 this year. The ship then underwent renovations, adding an outdoor hot tub on the top deck, but was sidelined as cruise companies halted operations after a British cruise ship, the Diamond Princess, became virus-stricken and quarantined at Yokohama Port in early February. NYK Cruises suspended a cruise around the world and other lines after March. The company “has taken the highest safety measures in every conceivable way” before resuming commercial operations, said Fukashi Sakamoto, president of NYK Cruises. Staff will work thoroughly to “prevent anyone infected with the virus from boarding the ship,” Sakamoto said. Crew members are required to take a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test twice or more before boarding. Passengers are also required to take a PCR test in advance by using a kit to collect saliva that the company mails to their home. On the day of boarding, passengers are asked to submit a questionnaire and report their health conditions and have their body temperatures checked. The company has also implemented measures to prevent the virus from spreading inside the ship if an infected person slips through security. In addition, the number of passengers has been almost halved from the ship's regular capacity of 872. Inside the ship, devices to check body temperatures have been set up at 20 or so locations, such as at restaurant entrances. Buffet-style dining for breakfast and lunch is no longer available. Passengers will instead choose from an a la carte menu. Three testing devices are available inside the ship to handle cases of suspected COVID-19. A team of clinical laboratory technicians and nurses are also onboard. The ship has also secured about 20 rooms to separate infected people from others. NYK Cruises is expected to operate about 30 domestic cruises until Jan. 4, 2021. The longest journey is three nights and four days. “Cruises were packed until last year,” Sakamoto said. But this year, “passengers can enjoy a laid-back atmosphere.”",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/13894724
1,Virus tests at border waived for 11 countries and regions,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"November 2, 2020 at 18:50 JST"," The government ended on Nov. 1 its requirement for visitors from 11 countries and regions, including Taiwan, China and South Korea, to get tested for the novel coronavirus at airports upon entry to Japan. It is the first such step the government has made in relaxing its testing restrictions at the border since the pandemic began. The testing requirements were waived after the alert level was lowered for infections in those countries and regions on Oct. 30, as their case trajectories have plateaued. However, those travelers still must self-isolate for two weeks from the following day after they enter Japan and they must refrain from using the public transportation system. They will also need to submit a form to authorities that states where they will stay during their visit to the country. Meanwhile, Nippon Medical School opened around-the-clock testing sites for the coronavirus at Narita Airport on Nov. 2. The service primarily targets business travelers who need to present their destination countries with a certificate that states they were not infected with the coronavirus. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test centers at Terminal 1 and Terminal 2 at the airport will conduct the tests through using nasal swabs and collecting saliva samples. For the first few weeks, it is expected to take five to six hours to complete the testing procedures, from a person being accepted for examination to issuing them a certificate. That is because customers’ samples will be taken to a lab outside the airport for diagnosis. But the university will set up a lab in the airport later this month, which will cut the time down to two hours. Testing and producing a certificate costs 39,800 yen ($379) for those who make a reservation. The charge is 46,500 yen for people who do not make a reservation and who seek to use the service at night or during the early morning.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/13895035

The number of newly confirmed infections tends to be lower on Mondays than other days of the week because of the fewer tests conducted in the previous few days. It normally takes about three days for the results of polymerase chain reaction tests to be confirmed and compiled by the Tokyo metropolitan government. Tokyo reported 78 new COVID-19 cases on Oct. 19, also a Monday. The metropolitan government said the number of serious cases requiring ventilators or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, also known as an ECMO lung bypass machine, decreased by two from the previous day to 32 on Nov. 2. Officials also corrected the number of people who contracted the virus that the government announced in the past, as the cumulative COVID-19 cases in the capital decreased by six. Corrections were made due to testing errors and inconsistencies. Three-time Olympic gold medal gymnast Kohei Uchimura who tested positive for the virus but tested negative on a second PCR test appears to be one such case.

0,Virus scares off Halloween-goers in Shibuya but not rest of Japan,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"November 1, 2020 at 15:10 JST"," Halloween partygoers were few and far between in Tokyo's Shibuya district on Oct. 31, while costume-clad revelers eschewed health warnings and packed downtown areas in other major cities across Japan. Youth wearing costumes from the wildly popular “Demon Slayer” manga series filled Osaka’s Dotonbori tourist area on fright night despite the urging of health officials for caution amid the novel coronavirus pandemic. In Shibuya, the square in front of Shibuya Station became congested with crowds after 7 p.m. that day, a notorious gathering point for raucous Halloween celebrations. But few people donned costumes this year, apparently heeding the Shibuya Ward mayor’s plea for not visiting the area for Halloween as the capital battles the pandemic. A 16-year-old female high school student from Saitama Prefecture sporting the costume of a “yokai” Japanese folk monster was one of only a handful visitors who dressed up for the occasion. “I do not pay much attention to the pandemic,” said the girl, who came with a friend. “Today is Halloween, and I wanted to dress up in a costume.” Shibuya’s famed scramble crossing was lined with police vehicles deployed to guard against possible boisterous merrymaking. Police officers, as well as private security guards, called out to throngs of pedestrians not to spill over into the roads and keep moving. “I get the impression that well under 10 percent of the people are wearing a costume this year compared with last year,” said one of the ward office employees on site to monitor the situation. Around the same time in Osaka, the Dotonbori district was packed with onlookers and crowds showing off their Halloween attire. This year, many paraded around dressed as characters from “Demon Slayer,” whose anime is currently breaking theater box office records. The carefree revelers posed for pictures with one another. In Nagoya, temporary restrictions were imposed on entry to some parts of the city center as it was jam-packed with visitors in costumes. Fukuoka also saw large crowds of people in disguise showing up in the city’s Tenjin shopping and entertainment district, swelling to the extent that made it difficult for passers-by to get through.

0,Fans wary of going to baseball game with eased attendance limit,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"October 31, 2020 at 18:30 JST"," YOKOHAMA--A trial run to sharply increase attendance at baseball stadiums to test the effectiveness of measures against the novel coronavirus proved to be a flop when only about 50 percent of spectators turned up for a game instead of the envisaged 80 percent. The Oct. 30 baseball game at Yokohama Stadium between the Yokohama DeNA BayStars and Hanshin Tigers was the first of three experimental events to test steps to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Yokohama Stadium is one of the planned venues for the Tokyo Olympics delayed until 2021 and the measures were tested for applicability next year. Baseball and other sporting events now have an attendance restriction of 50 percent of capacity. But that was lifted for the three-game series, with the maximum for the first game set at 80 percent of capacity. But only 16,594 fans showed up, or about 50 percent of stadium capacity. Those entering the stadium were asked to install the Cocoa app that notifies users if they came in contact during the game with someone later confirmed as infected with novel coronavirus. Users also registered their seat for the game with a special app that will notify the user over the next few days if someone who sat near them comes down with COVID-19. Fans in the stands were asked not to cheer loudly due to concerns that droplets of saliva might lead to a spread of the virus. But when Hanshin scored the first run of the game, Tigers fans sitting in the outfield bleachers stood up and let out a roar, leading security personnel to scramble to the area to urge the fans to sit and cheer. Tetsuya Matsumoto, a professor of infectious diseases at the International University of Health and Welfare in Narita, Chiba Prefecture, was at the game. One of the problems he pointed out was the lines that formed at food stalls within the stadium. About 30 people were lined up in a narrow space. While an app on the Line free messaging service informed registered smartphone users when certain areas were congested, others that were said to be open turned out to be congested, leading Matsumoto to point out that the app must be improved. “There would be no problem if people quietly waited in line, but if they are part of a group they may tend to converse,” he said. Vendors selling beer in the stands exchanged money with their customers. Matsumoto said vendors need to frequently disinfect their gloves to prevent a spread of infections. But he had praise for stadium staff who approached fans not wearing face masks and asked them to do so. Overall, Matsumoto said a more cautious test might have been advisable. “If a cluster of infections results, people will get the impression that it is still too early (to relax restrictions on attendance at major events),” Matsumoto said. Ninety-percent of the seats were to be made available for the Oct. 31 game and all seats for the Nov. 1 game.

1,Entry rules to be further eased; good news for foreign residents,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"October 31, 2020 at 16:35 JST"," The government will ease entry restrictions from November on foreign arrivals, but at nowhere near the level envisaged by Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga to encourage a greater flow of travelers in and out of Japan to spur economic activity. Japanese businesspeople on overseas trips and foreign residents returning to Japan will no longer be obliged to self-isolate for two weeks. In addition, advisories to avoid visiting and entry bans on citizens of 11 nations and regions will be lifted from November. The nations include China, South Korea, Taiwan, Australia and New Zealand. This will mark the first lifting of entry bans since the measures were implemented to prevent a further spread of the novel coronavirus. At an Oct. 30 meeting of a government task force that decided to ease entry restrictions, Suga pointed out that new COVID-19 cases continued to increase at a gradual pace from October, indicating further vigilance was needed. He had emphasized economic revitalization and issued instructions to consider ways to ease entry restrictions. After replacing Shinzo Abe as prime minister in September, Suga noted that Japan had the capacity to test 10,000 arrivals a day from overseas but that the actual number of people taking polymerase chain reaction and other checks was well below that figure. Measures concerning entry restrictions entered a new phase after Suga took office. For example, entry restrictions were relaxed for all nations but limited to those who planned medium- to long-term stays. Tourists are still banned, but short-term business visas have been issued. The latter visits were allowed on condition the entrants self-quarantined for two weeks on arrival. That made it difficult for businessmen to plan trips to Japan if they only intended to stay for a few days. Exempting the self-quarantine period is also possible. However, 16 nations in other parts of Asia are the only possible candidates for the measure. Officials noted that bilateral agreements on quarantine control are also required before the exemption can take effect. So far, agreements have only been reached with Singapore, South Korea and Vietnam. Government officials also looked into possibly expanding the easing of entry restrictions beyond the 16 nations, including those in the West. At one time, there was talk about implementing an exemption for business travelers who would only be staying in Japan for under 72 hours. Initially, that measure would have been applied to 30 nations and regions with close economic ties to Japan, including the United States, Europe and India. But the recent surge in COVID-19 cases in Europe led to calls for greater caution and focus was shifted to applying the 72-hour rule to the other Asian nations that have looser conditions for business travel. In the end, the idea of allowing 72-hour stays was abandoned. While some government agencies are still pressing to further ease entry restrictions, the situation within Japan also cannot be ignored. A spike in COVID-19 cases at this junction would almost certainly push back a further relaxation of restrictions.

0,Call to extend the New Year break so millions avoid getting infected,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"October 31, 2020 at 15:25 JST"," Businesses are being asked to extend their year-end New Year holiday period so millions of people can stagger their travel and avoid congestion that the government fears could trigger a drastic spike in new coronavirus infections. The request to business groups and local government associations was made by Yasutoshi Nishimura, the state minister for economic revitalization who is in charge of handling the health crisis. Normally, millions of Japanese go to their hometowns at that time of year and flock to local temples and shrines over the first three days of the break. A particular concern is that Jan. 4 falls on a Monday, which likely will prompt many companies to welcome employees back to work. That would result in hordes of people all converging on railway lines, airlines and expressways on Jan. 3 to return home in time for their first day back on the job. With no signs of the novel coronavirus pandemic abating, Nishimura felt that drastic measures are needed. However, he stopped short of saying how many consecutive days off should be granted to office and factory workers, saying only that, “I want various measures to be considered, such as dividing up work or rotating the days off depending on the actual condition for each company and business sector.” He held a video conference Oct. 30 with representatives of the three major business groups as well as the National Governors’ Association and the Japan Association of City Mayors to seek their cooperation in enforcing the policy. The government, as part of its mission to curtail the spread of COVID-19, keeps stressing the need for the public to avoid congested conditions and poorly ventilated venues where there is a high likelihood of coming into close contact with others. Nishimura had earlier suggested the possibility that workers could get 17 straight days off if they started their winter vacation on Dec. 26 and did not return to work until Jan. 12 since Jan. 11 is Coming-of-Age Day, a national holiday. In contrast, Christmas is not a national holiday so under Nishimura’s original proposal that day would be the final working day of the year for many workers. However, during the Oct. 30 video conference, Nishimura was careful to avoid stating how many days he wanted workers to take off, suggesting only that they take turns taking time off between Dec. 26 and Jan. 11. Because the decision on days off are left up to each company and local government, it remains unclear if Nishimura’s request will have any effect. Moreover, many small businesses simply do not have a sufficient workforce that would allow rotating days off while trying to maintain normal operations. The education ministry has decided not to extend the winter vacation period for schools, meaning Nishimura's request might lead to differences when parents and children have days off. It may also be difficult for some local education boards to extend the winter vacation period because they are still playing catch-up for lost class time due to the delayed start of the school year caused by the pandemic. Essential workers, such as medical professionals and care providers for the elderly, would also likely find it difficult to spread out days off. “The medical and elderly care sectors operate 24 hours a day, 365 days a year,” noted an official with the Japan Federation of Medical Worker’s Unions. “It is difficult to spread out days off, and it is not common practice to take consecutive days off.” On the other hand, officials of transportation and travel companies welcomed the idea as it might encourage more people to take trips if they thought railways and airlines would be less crowded.

0,"New COVID-19 cases surge in second wave, but death rate falls",['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"October 30, 2020 at 18:54 JST"," The number of novel coronavirus infections confirmed in Japan from July to September was four times higher than the figure for March to May, but the death rate from COVID-19 has dropped significantly. Although Tokyo still accounts for the bulk of the new cases, virus hotspots are popping up in other locations around the country, and death rates have risen during the “second wave” of the pandemic in three prefectures with large urban centers. “Infection clusters have occurred at various places,” Shigeru Omi, head of the virus subcommittee under a government expert panel, said at a news conference on Oct. 29. He expressed a sense of crisis over the government’s delayed implementation of control measures, saying, “We must put the matter to rest soon.” June was excluded from the comparison of the two three-month periods because the number of new infection cases that month was small. The number of tests on people with mild or no symptoms also increased in the summer, so a simple comparison is impossible. But trends in the spread of the virus could be discerned from the available data. Japan surpassed 100,000 total cases on Oct. 29. Overall, the number of COVID-19 deaths from July to September was 601, a decrease by nearly 300 from the March-May period. Tokyo confirmed about 20,000 new infections from July to September, while the number of COVID-19 deaths decreased by 70 percent in the capital. However, the fatality rate increased by 1.4 times in Osaka Prefecture, by 2.3 times in Fukuoka Prefecture, and by 1.5 times in Aichi Prefecture in the second wave. In these three prefectures, young people infected with the virus increased in the July-September period. Subsequent to that, the number of COVID-19 patients aged 80 and older, who are more at risk of developing severe symptoms, jumped by 3.5 times to 5.6 times in the three prefectures. In Tokyo, the number of infected people 80 or older remained almost the same. In Kanagawa, Saitama and Chiba prefectures, which border Tokyo, the number of COVID-19 deaths in the second wave also decreased. The number of new COVID-19 cases did not decrease significantly in Tokyo and the three surrounding prefectures after the central government lifted its nationwide state of emergency in May. But residents in these areas were apparently more diligent in taking measures to avoid infections than people in other regions, some experts said. The panel pointed to a failure to control cluster infections and prevent their spread to wider areas for the recent increase in COVID-19 numbers. Hokkaido on Oct. 23 broke its daily record when it reported 51 new infection cases, including people who contracted the virus at a nursing home and a host club. In Hirosaki, Aomori Prefecture, a restaurant became an infection hotspot in October, and the virus spread to a hospital in the city. Big cities in the summer had to deal with the virus traveling from nightlife districts to care facilities. Cities in less-populated prefectures are now dealing with the same situation. A report presented at the subcommittee during the Oct. 29 meeting stated that the second wave “came from Shinjuku,” a pointed reference to the nightlife district in the capital. From late May, the number of new cases in Tokyo rose among visitors and workers at restaurants and bars where hosts and hostesses provide services to customers. The virus then spread from Shinjuku to Osaka, Fukuoka and Aichi prefectures, according to the report. The report also mentioned some cases in which an infection originated at a restaurant and then spread to workplaces, homes and elderly care facilities. In Osaka Prefecture, from mid-June to late September, infection clusters hit nine health care institutions and 23 care facilities for elderly and disabled people, infecting 675 people in total. In the earlier period, clusters occurred at six health care institutions in the prefecture, infecting 284 people in total.

The panel, which met on Oct. 28, adopted a grimmer view about the number of nationwide infections, changing its assessment from “unchanged or slightly increasing” given at its previous meeting on Oct. 22. It said the number of new cases in the greater Tokyo metropolitan area remains high and infections are on the increase in Hokkaido, where cluster infections have occurred in an entertainment district, as well as Aomori, Miyagi, Gunma, Saitama and Okinawa prefectures. The panel’s latest analysis shows 3.21 new cases per 100,000 people were confirmed over the week through Oct. 26, up from the 2.84 cases reported over the week until Oct. 12. The number of new infections that can spread from just one infected person, called the effective reproduction number, was high in some prefectures such as Osaka, Hokkaido, Okinawa, and the estimated nationwide figure stood at 1.02 as of Oct. 8, according to the analysis. The number above one means infections are spreading. “We didn’t bring up the impact of the ‘Go To Travel’ program on the rise in cases at the meeting,” said Takaji Wakita, who chairs the panel, after the Oct. 28 meeting. “But movement of people could help increase infections, so we need to closely monitor it.” He also pointed out that cluster infections have occurred at a variety of locations, including entertainment districts in cities outside urban areas, group meals, and workplaces as well as among non-Japanese communities. “Necessary information should be provided in foreign languages so that foreigners can consult or visit medical institutions,” said Wakita, who is also the head of the National Institute of Infectious Diseases. The panel also announced the same day the percentage of people who became seriously ill after they were confirmed infected with the virus between June and August, when a “ second wave ” of infections hit the country. The figure was 8.5 percent for patients in their 60s or older, compared with 0.3 percent for those in their 50s or younger. The percentage of patients who died was 5.7 percent among those aged 60 or older and 0.06 percent for those aged 59 or younger. The data show elderly people and those with pre-existing conditions tend to develop severe symptoms of COVID-19. The panel classified patients who were hospitalized in intensive care units, placed on ventilators or died after contracting the virus as “serious cases.” It also listed chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), chronic kidney disease, diabetes, high blood pressure, cardiovascular diseases and obesity as underlying conditions that are likely to raise the severity of COVID-19 symptoms.

The number includes the passengers of the Diamond Princess cruise ship quarantined in Yokohama Port that became host to a large infection cluster earlier this year. More than nine months into the pandemic, there are no signs of touching bottom, as 300 to 700 people continue to test positive daily nationwide. Tokyo officials confirmed on Oct. 29 that 221 people have newly contracted the virus, pushing the cumulative number of COVID-19 patients in Japan over 100,000. The first COVID-19 case was reported in mid-January. The number began to skyrocket starting in late March and then exceeded 10,000 cases on April 16. The speed of transmission slowed for a while from May to June, but the number jumped back up again in July. From late July to early August, the daily count of new COVID-19 cases exceeded 1,500 on some days. The cumulative case total topped 50,000 on Aug. 10. It took 18 days for the total case count to increase from 90,000 to 100,000. The pace was less frantic compared to early August, when 10,000 new cases were reported over eight days. Nonetheless, the daily number of new COVID-19 cases has not relented. Cases linked to cluster infections have increased, as many people contracted the virus at restaurants and bars, hospitals, care facilities and schools. Tokyo leads the cumulative number of COVID-19 patients with more than 30,000, which accounts for nearly a third of the national cumulative number. Osaka Prefecture follows with 12,000, while Kanagawa Prefecture has reported a total of 8,000 cases. In Aichi Prefecture, 6,000 people have been infected with the virus, while Saitama and Fukuoka prefectures each reported more than 5,000 cases in total. Urban centers have visibly been hit hardest in the pandemic, but less-populated prefectures and rural areas are not out of the woods just yet. Okinawa Prefecture has dealt with more than 3,000 cases so far.

The alert level was raised one notch to 2 from the lowest 1 on the five-level scale Hokkaido introduced for vigilance against the virus in August. The prefecture began reporting 40-60 daily new cases starting late this month, leaving hospitals with fewer beds than previously to care for patients, after remaining at level 1 for weeks. Due to the increasing burdens on Hokkaido's health care system, prefectural officials decided that the situation warranted a level 2 alert. The prefectural government has designated the coming two weeks through Nov. 10 as a period of intensive countermeasures for fighting the pandemic, and is urging residents not to go out if they feel unwell, to wear masks when they do go out and to work from home. While stepping up warnings, prefectural officials are striving to keep the economy going as a growing number of tourists are descending on Hokkaido to cash in on travel discounts under the central government’s ""Go To Travel"" program that is aimed at helping the tourism industry weather the crisis. “It is extremely important to contain the pandemic at this stage to keep both the economy and social activities going,” said Hokkaido Governor Naomichi Suzuki. The central government is also closely monitoring the surges in Hokkaido. Yasutoshi Nishimura, a minister in charge of economic revitalization, noted that Hokkaido faces the challenge of grappling with the pandemic at a time when indoor ventilation tends to become poor due to the severe cold weather there.

1,Mannequin study shows masks can prevent virus transmission,['By HAJIME MIKAMI/ Staff Writer'],"October 29, 2020 at 07:10 JST"," A new study says wearing a face mask is effective at preventing airborne transmission of the novel coronavirus, particularly so when a person infected with the deadly virus puts on one. A group of researchers from the Institute of Medical Science at the University of Tokyo conducted experiments where they gave mannequins mock artificial respiratory systems and had them wear different types of masks. A special chamber was developed to simulate airborne transmission of the actual novel coronavirus and measure the amount of infectious droplets, which are produced by humans breathing and coughing, that pass through the mask a mannequin is wearing. The study, published Oct. 21 in the online version of the U.S. science journal mSphere, was led by Yoshihiro Kawaoka, a virology professor, and Hiroshi Ueki, a project assistant professor, both at the institute. The study is significant because amid the pandemic, especially at its earliest stages, there was a lack of consensus and evidence on whether masks are effective for protecting against airborne transmission of the virus. In the paper, researchers said, “We found that cotton masks, surgical masks, and N95 masks all have a protective effect with respect to the transmission of infective droplets and aerosols” of the novel coronavirus, and that “the protective efficiency was higher when masks were worn by a virus spreader.” In the experiment, researchers placed two mannequin heads near one another facing each other. One was labeled as a COVID-19 patient and was set up to emit a mist through its mouth, mimicking a virus spreader exhaling. The other, a “non-patient” and otherwise healthy mannequin, was connected to an artificial ventilator and equipment that let researchers detect how much of the virus it would inhale. A gelatin film was placed along the respiratory tract, and the amount of virus attached to it was measured. The researchers tested a range of scenarios with three types of face masks placed on the mannequins: an N95 mask, a surgical mask and a cotton cloth mask. When the infected mannequin wore a surgical or cotton mask, and the healthy mannequin did not wear a mask, it reduced the amount of the virus that the healthy mannequin inhaled to 20 to 40 percent of the amount that the healthy mannequin inhaled with no mask. When the infected mannequin wore an N95 mask, a type of mask that is not expected to be worn by a COVID-19 patient, the amount of the virus that the healthy mannequin inhaled was nearly zero percent. When the infected mannequin did not wear a mask and the healthy mannequin wore a surgical mask, it reduced the amount of the virus that the healthy mannequin inhaled to 50 percent of the amount of virus it inhaled with no mask. The amount was reduced to 60 to 80 percent with a cotton mask, while it was reduced to 10 to 20 percent with an N95 mask. When both mannequins wore a cotton mask, the amount of inhaled virus dropped to 30 percent of the amount inhaled when neither wore masks. When they both donned a surgical mask, the figure dropped further, to the range of 20 to 30 percent. But an N95 mask needs to fit the wearer’s face perfectly to work most effectively. When the mannequins did not wear N95 masks correctly, they had about the same result as they would wearing a surgical mask. In each instance, including when they both wore masks, the researchers found genes of the virus made their way into the respiratory tract of the healthy mannequin. But they said more research is needed to determine whether those genes would necessarily cause infection. “It is important for everybody to wear a mask to prevent the spread of the pandemic,” said Kawaoka. But he also cautioned the public “not to put too much trust in masks,” and advised that they take other preventative measures, such as keeping a safe distance from each other as well.

The central government on Oct. 23 decided to request major business organizations to show flexibility and extend the holiday period to allow employees to take breaks until Coming-of-Age Day on Jan. 11. Japan during the New Year holiday season is a time when millions of people flock to their hometowns and visit shrines and temples to make wishes for the coming year. But infectious disease experts at the day’s meeting of the government’s panel handling the COVID-19 crisis called for a drastic change to the ritual next year as a move to safeguard people's health.

Instead, he asked young people, who in past years have packed Shibuya streets while dressed in costumes and partied all night, to attend the ward-sponsored online Halloween events. In recent years, many rowdy party-goers consumed alcohol in the area surrounding Shibuya Station and then raised hell by playing music at full blast, trashing city streets and vandalizing property. The ward office responded last year by banning drinking in parks and on streets near the station at Halloween. Hasebe said the problem is not only caused by certain troublemakers, but also by spectators who gather in Shibuya to see people’s over-the-top costumes. “Their bad manners are a problem, too,” he said. But activities such as enjoying food and drinks inside a restaurant, while keeping a safe distance from one another, are no problem, he said. “It doesn’t mean that I don’t want anybody to come to Shibuya at all,” he added. The ward office will reduce its alert level by limiting the deployment of security guards to only on Oct. 31. It will no longer set up temporary portable toilets and change spaces in the area. And it will not close the roads around the famed Shibuya scramble crossing to vehicle traffic. At the same time, the ward office is encouraging people to participate in the Halloween-related online events it is sponsoring, which start on Oct. 26 and continue until Oct. 31.

0,Screens showing CO2 level set up at venues to lessen virus risk,['By RYOSUKE NONAKA/ Staff Writer'],"October 23, 2020 at 07:00 JST"," At a recent live pop concert in Tokyo's Chiyoda Ward, the large screen set up at the edge of the stage didn't give the audience a close-up view of the idol or any other eye-catching visual. Instead, it changed colors to show the carbon dioxide (CO2) level in the air, in an unconventional effort to contain the spread of COVID-19. During her performance, a pop star on the stage watched the screen and said the CO2 concentration “appears green, which means this live concert is peaceful.” Her comment drew laughter from the spectators. The display turns green when the CO2 concentration is 1,000 parts per million (ppm) or less, because the figure indicates the air indoors is being appropriately exchanged. When the meter was exposed to the breath from one of the performers during the event, the screen color changed to red to show an increase in the CO2 level. “ Look at this to see the monitor quickly returning to green,” said the singer. “The hall is well ventilated, so enjoy our performance without any worries.” The screens are being installed at concert venues, restaurants, airports and other public places. Showing the airborne CO2 concentration is expected to make clear whether the sites are ventilated properly, helping prevent the “three Cs” of closed, crowded and close-contact settings. Indoor concerts are often said to pose the threat of a three-Cs environment, as performers sing and spectators sometimes dance in confined spaces. The concert would have been suspended for improper ventilation reasons if the reading had topped 3,000 ppm, but the figure never reached the limit during the half-day event. WHY THE CO2 LEVEL IS MEASURED CO2, a substance found in the breath in large amounts, spreads easily in the atmosphere, so changes in the CO2 concentration are a useful indicator to identify how closed and crowded the space is. For that reason, the Japan Society for Occupational Health states the CO2 level of 1,000 ppm or lower suggests the room is well ventilated based on the building hygiene control law and other criteria. Under its recommendation, a room with a reading of higher than 3,500 ppm has an extremely bad ventilation capability, so the facility should not be used as a countermeasure against the novel coronavirus. According to data from the Japan Meteorological Agency, the global average CO2 concentration is around 400 ppm outdoors. The society has also made available a simulator on its website ( http://jsoh-ohe.umin.jp/covid_simulator/covid_simulator.html ), so the CO2 level for a site can be predicted if such factors as its size, how many people are there and the presence of ventilation equipment are input. The September experiment at the live concert was carried out by Yo Ishigaki, a specially appointed associate professor of informatics at the University of Electro-Communications, and Tomoaki Okuda, a chemistry professor at Keio University. Under their program, the two researchers surveyed CO2 concentrations at many live concert sites in Tokyo. In one case, the reading reached 6,000 ppm within 60 minutes from the event’s beginning, while a facility recorded more than 10,000 ppm at one point. Direct correlations between the CO2 level and the risk of contracting COVID-19 have yet to be confirmed. But Okuda estimated the CO2 level at a restaurant in China where many infections were reported based on its room arrangement and population, and found the CO2 reading likely rose there similar to concert sites with high concentration levels. “ I feel infection risks could be affected by how well the site is ventilated,” said Ishigaki. In May, the operator of Nanki-Shirahama Airport in Shirahama, Wakayama Prefecture, introduced a CO2 detector fitted with a human sensor to count people at the waiting room for departing passengers. The measured CO2 concentration is combined with data on the population density and degree of noise, allowing whether the space boasts the three-Cs settings to be determined. The CO2 reading is shown on the monitor at the waiting room, and staffers can check collected data on their smartphones at any time. When the three-Cs conditions are detected, ventilation will be increased and a warning issued for passengers. As there are no obvious standards for the so-called three-Cs settings, airport staff members comprehensively consider all gathered pieces of information to make a decision. Ryota Morishige, head of the airport operator’s passenger attraction and local revitalization department, said the system was put in operation at the waiting room, where up to 165 people stay before their boarding. “ We had taken countermeasures, such as putting foot marks on the floor for people to maintain distance from one another but a mechanism is essential to decide if the room is a proper three-Cs environment,” said Morishige. “Showing data on the monitor gives a feeling of safety among passengers.” CO2 measuring is spreading as a means to contain the virus. Information technology provider Uhuru Corp. in Tokyo’s Minato Ward, which offers the system to mitigate the three-Cs danger for the airport, said the same service is being used at sports clubs and restaurants as well. Expecting demand for such a system to grow among popular restaurants and event sites under the government’s “Go To Eat” and other economic stimulus programs, major communications carriers, machinery makers and various other companies have entered the CO2 monitoring system business. Ishigaki worked with Yaguchi Electric Corp. in Ishinomaki, Miyagi Prefecture, to develop a portable CO2 meter that is designed to be connected to a smartphone. It went on sale in August. Masatoshi Sato, president of Yaguchi Electric, said the company has received many inquiries about the meter. “ Many restaurants and other operators want to show the risk of the three-Cs in a visualized form,” he said. “With our production capacity limited, I am sorry that those who now place orders have to wait a little while to receive the product.”",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/13832094

If their economic conditions further worsen due to the fallout from the pandemic, that could lead to an even lower birthrate.” After finding out they are pregnant, women notify local municipalities to receive maternal and child health handbooks. More than 90 percent of women report their pregnancies by the 11th week, according to the ministry. The ministry tallied the number of pregnancies reported to municipalities nationwide from January through July to find out the effects of the pandemic on pregnancies. The data showed a 0.5-percent drop in the number of pregnancy reports between January and April from the same period last year, but the year-on-year decline increased from May. In May, 67,919 pregnancies were reported, down 17.1 percent from the same month a year ago. The number of pregnancy reports fell by 5.4 percent year on year to 67,115 in June, while the figure dropped by 10.9 percent from a year earlier to 69,448 in July. In 2016, the number of newborns sank below a million for the first time since the end of World War II. The figure dropped even further to 865,239 in 2019, setting a record low for the postwar era. The impact was so huge that it was dubbed the “860,000 shock.” A further drop in the birthrate could cause Japan's chronic labor shortage to become even more severe, resulting in fewer people paying social security premiums.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/13860303

The group holding company will disclose its business performance forecast for the year through March when it announces its midterm results on Oct. 27. ANA Holdings is already planning cost-saving measures, including sales of about 10 percent of its aircraft fleet, but it cannot predict the end to the novel coronavirus crisis that has hammered flight services, especially for international routes, the sources said Oct. 21. The expected net loss would dwarf the company’s current record loss of 57.3 billion yen for fiscal 2009, following the 2008 collapse of U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers. ANA Holdings reported a net profit of 27.6 billion yen for fiscal 2019, but then the virus seriously hit revenue. The number of passengers for the ANA group between April and August this year plummeted by 96.3 percent year on year for international flights. Although Japan and other countries have eased their border restrictions, it is unknown when normal traffic, including tourists, will resume. The number of passengers for domestic flights started recovering in June, but demand remains very weak compared with normal years. ANA Holdings’ announcement on Oct. 27 will also include structural reforms, such as measures to reduce fixed costs. The company will also slash base salaries and withhold winter bonuses. It has proposed an average 30 percent reduction in annual salaries to its labor union and is seeking voluntary retirement among the workforce. ANA Holdings owned 300 aircraft as of the end of June and has had to pay for maintenance, leasing and depreciation costs even on planes grounded in the pandemic. The company is considering selling about 30 of its airplanes, mainly large ones, the sources said. The effects of the structural reforms will likely be reflected in the business performance forecast for fiscal 2020.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/13859830

0,JTB to shutter 20% of travel outlets in Japan in five years,['By SATOSHI KIMURA/ Staff Writer'],"October 18, 2020 at 16:40 JST"," Japan's largest travel agency is feeling the sting of the novel coronavirus pandemic, as slumping demand will force it to close about 20 percent of its outlets over the next five years. Eijiro Yamakita, president of JTB Corp., said the company plans to shutter about 100 domestic outlets over a five-year period and move toward greater use of online channels for customers, in response to questions from The Asahi Shimbun. In fiscal 2019, JTB had about 480 branches throughout Japan. Staff from the closing outlets will be moved to other locations and offered various opportunities. Yamakita said the plan would involve a reduction of a targeted number of employees. “It will likely take a considerably long time for complete recovery (of travel demand),"" he said. ""While reducing the number of outlets, we will also change the full-service branches into streamlined outlets while making greater use of digital measures. We want to move quickly in making such changes.” JTB, which has branches in most major cities of Japan, had long been considered a “department store-type” travel agency because many outlets had specialized sections for domestic and foreign travel. To increase efficiency, the company plans to create a new online support structure that would utilize the knowledge and skills held by those in highly specialized areas. Tourism demand plummeted with the spread of the novel coronavirus pandemic. While domestic travel is slowly recovering, in part due to the government’s “Go To Travel” tourism promotion program, there are no signs of recovery in foreign tours, which are considerably more expensive. According to the Japan Tourism Agency’s statistics on the transaction amount handled by major travel agencies, JTB totaled 84.5 billion yen ($801 million) for the period between April and August. That represented an 88-percent decrease from the same period in 2019. JTB has already reached an agreement with its labor union to forego winter bonuses for its approximately 13,000 employees. Yamakita also said the company procured about 140 billion yen in spring to meet its cash flow demands. The travel agency H.I.S. Co. has also announced its plan to close about one-third of its 260 or so domestic branches by next summer.

1,Supercomputer to test virus risk at near-capacity baseball stadium,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"October 15, 2020 at 17:59 JST"," Tens of thousands of baseball fans and Japanese supercomputer Fugaku will be involved in a study on the effectiveness of anti-virus measures at a stadium with a near-capacity crowd. Local government officials hope the results will provide useful information in deciding when to ease entry restrictions for large events or crowded venues, such as athletic competitions and night clubs. The central government has asked for these voluntary restrictions to curb the spread of the novel coronavirus. The verification test will be conducted at the Yokohama DeNA BayStars’ home games scheduled between Oct. 27 and Nov. 1 at Yokohama Stadium in Kanagawa Prefecture, according to government sources. The prefectural and city governments will conduct the test with companies and groups, such as DeNA Co., NEC Corp. and Line Corp. Officials explained the plan and sought opinions from experts at an Oct. 15 meeting of the central government’s council on dealing with the novel coronavirus. Officials expect to fill at least 80 percent of the 34,000-seat stadium for the ballgames. The spectators will be informed about the test to a certain degree. During the games, multiple high-definition cameras will examine the movements of people inside the stadium, the density and the percentage of people who wear masks. The data will be combined with the results simulated by Fugaku, one of the world’s best-performing supercomputers. The analysis will show, for example, how saliva droplets spread when spectators wearing masks yell out, eat and drink, among other activities. During the games, announcements and security guards will encourage the fans to wear masks. Officials involved in the test will rate the effectiveness of such measures. COVID-19 contact-tracing apps, such as COCOA introduced by the health ministry, and the Line messaging app will be used to identify people who come in close contact with someone who is later confirmed to be infected. The officials will also work to ensure smooth communications and coordination between event organizers and public health centers. Satoshi Hori, a professor of infection control at Juntendo University, said similar verification tests have been conducted at concerts and other events overseas. Hori said it is important for officials and event organizers to “take measures and urge elderly people and those with pre-existing conditions, who are at higher risk of developing severe symptoms once they contract the virus, to refrain from entering a venue.” Under the central government’s guidelines, venues for sports competitions and music concerts with crowd numbers expected to exceed 10,000 should keep capacity at only 50 percent. Similarly, events at venues with a capacity under 10,000, such as night clubs and movie theaters, should limit the number to a maximum 5,000. That measure is expected to remain until the end of November. The central government has eased restrictions on certain events, such as a Kabuki play, an art exhibition and a film screening.

Under the campaign, the government subsidizes up to half the cost of a domestic trip to help sustain the travel industry battered by the coronavirus. Flooded with reservations, leading websites such as Yahoo!

0,Study: Anti-virus face shields allow almost all minute droplets to leak,['By NAOYA KON/ Staff Writer'],"October 13, 2020 at 07:00 JST"," Researchers have bad news for people who wear face shields to prevent novel coronavirus infections: The equipment is woefully inadequate in containing droplets that can spread the virus. And they have the calculations of a supercomputer to back up their findings. The team of researchers from the Riken national research institute, Kobe University and other institutions used Fugaku, one of the world’s best-performing supercomputers, to simulate the spread of droplets from a wearer of a face mask and a wearer of a face shield. According to the results released in August, the face shield allowed nearly 100 percent of aerosol particles, which measure 5 micrometers or less, and half of droplets of 50 micrometers to leak. In comparison, the face mask made of nonwoven fabric leaked about 30 percent of aerosol particles but caught almost all of the larger droplets measuring 50 micrometers or more. “The nonwoven face mask is the winner in terms of effectiveness in blocking the spray of droplets,” said Makoto Tsubokura, a professor of computational fluid dynamics with Kobe University, who also serves as a Riken team leader. Medical workers have used face shields to block blood and oral droplets from entering their eyes, nose and mouth. But the practice of wearing face shields instead of face masks has become more widespread among members of the public. Face shields are less stifling than masks and allow the lips to show through. This is important for many service industry workers, language teachers, singers and even participants of drinking parties. Another study showed the dangers of this trend from a health standpoint. A team of researchers from Florida Atlantic University visualized the spread of droplets from a wearer of a face mask or a face shield. Their research results, published in September in Physics of Fluids, a scientific journal, showed that a face shield can partially block the spread of droplets emitted straight forward from the wearer’s mouth. But the droplets can escape freely from the right, left and underside of the shield. In 10 seconds, the droplets were found to have spread 1 meter or so into the surroundings, the study showed. “Widespread public use of (this and other) alternatives to regular masks could have an adverse effect on mitigation efforts,” the research team warned. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has said a face shield can protect the wearer’s eyes from infection, but the level of protection it provides to people nearby from the droplets of the wearer is unknown. The CDC does not recommend face shields as a substitute for masks in blocking the spread of the novel coronavirus. The Osaka Medical Association in June released a statement on the use of face shields in schools and classrooms. It said face shields are designed to prevent droplets from coughs and sneezes from entering the wearer’s eyes and are not intended to prevent the wearer’s saliva from being sprayed on others. The statement also cited risks in using face shields, including injuries from hitting a section of plastic, accidents caused by the restricted field of vision, and heatstroke from trapped hot air. Kazunari Onishi, an associate professor of environmental epidemiology with St. Luke’s International University in Tokyo, called for caution in using face shields. “Wearing a face shield alone, with no face mask on, is not effective enough for blocking infections,” Onishi said. “Face shields can only block larger droplets. They let go most parts of smaller droplets.” He added that nothing is known about the size of droplets that can cause COVID-19 infections.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/13750596

A leading Tokyo-based musical instruments retailer has developed a face mask with a hole in it with a maker of everyday sundries here. The COVID-19 pandemic has made it extremely difficult for musicians to perform in groups due to the danger of spreading the virus. Technad Corp., based in Hashima, released its IKE mask in mid-August, which it created with Shimamura Music Co. “I want to return to the days where music can be played b y stopping the virus spreading through droplets from people’s mouths,” said Technad's president, Masumi Hara, 53, displaying the masks at a joint presentation event organized by the Hashima Chamber of Commerce and Industry. The masks were made out of material featuring silica gel, which removes moisture and odor on their inner side, according to company representatives. The hole in the mask over the mouth is big enough to let people wearing them drink beverages with a straw. The masks are also fitted with a flap on the inner side so the hole can be covered. Technad is also looking to pitch the IKE masks to police offers and others who need to blow whistles. The masks sell for 1,680 yen ($16.03) before tax and come in light gray, white and black.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/13752644
0,Sales for ‘Go To Eat’ campaign coupons begin early in Niigata,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"October 6, 2020 at 19:29 JST"," Sales of premium “Go To Eat” restaurant coupons, which offer discounts of 25 percent off meals, started early in Niigata on Oct. 5, ahead of other prefectures in Japan. The coupons are issued by each prefecture as part of Japan’s “Go To Eat” government-subsidy campaign, which aims to provide a boost to restaurants left roiling after the coronavirus pandemic took major bites out of their revenue. The central government has set aside 180 billion yen ($1.7 billion) for the campaign designed to revitalize the nation’s restaurant industry. People lined for the premium coupons on sale in Niigata Prefecture across some 150 service counters, which became available at 10 a.m. A coupon book costs 10,000 yen, but is valued at 12,500 yen worth of food. In some areas, dozens of people waited in line to purchase their books. Maki Ogawa, 82, used one of her coupons for lunch immediately after purchasing it. She ate a daily lunch special, priced at 900 yen before tax, at the sushi restaurant Takizushi, a local fixture established 49 years ago in Niigata's Nishi Ward. The “Go To Eat” campaign also offers another program that allows customers to receive rewards points that they can later spend like cash at registered restaurants when they use certain reservation websites. Although it started on Oct. 1, Ogawa said that it was difficult to use the program. “Meal coupons are much easier to understand, and this is win-win relationship between restaurants and customers,” she said. “I hope that more customers will return to local establishments.” Sales at the sushi restaurant during September dropped by half compared to its September sales from last year. The restaurant’s proprietor, Mitsuhiro Takizawa, 47, thought the coupon program was a great opportunity to generate business, and decided to apply to register his establishment under the program. He reduced the number of customers’ seats at the restaurant from more than 100 to about 45 as a preventive measure against the coronavirus. Only two customers used their meal coupons during lunchtime that day, but he is optimistic it will catch on. “It might not increase the sales right away, but more new customers could choose to dine out in the future,” Takizawa said. The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries chooses the prefectures’ coupon program administrators through a public invitation process. But program officials are advising some caution because the ways customers can purchase the coupons, and their starting periods, differ between areas. There are three coupon books being sold: a 10,000-yen book with a total value of 12,500 yen; an 8,000-yen book with a value of 10,000 yen; and a 4,000-yen book with a value of 5,000 yen. Each book is made up of 1,000-yen tickets and 500-yen tickets in many areas. But an operator in Ehime decided to offer 4,000-yen books. “We would like high school and university students to use them, so we lowered the unit price,” an official said. Participating administrators in Niigata and Hyogo prefectures offer coupon books only comprised of 500-yen tickets because they are expected to be used for low-priced lunches where customers do not get change back. Digital coupons are being issued through the popular Line social media app in some prefectures to reduce human contact when coupons are purchased or used. Digital meal coupons make up 90 percent of the program budget for Chiba Prefecture, while in Shiga Prefecture, 60 percent of the overall budget is set aside for them. The coupons are also being sold differently from area to area. Tickets that can be exchanged to purchase coupons are being distributed to all households in Ishikawa Prefecture, to make it fair. A coupon lottery system was set up in Kagawa Prefecture, which works through sending residents double postcards. But in most cases, sales are on a first-come, first-served basis, and will end once all the coupons sell out. In many areas such as Akita, Tochigi, Yamanashi and Toyama prefectures, people can purchase coupons at local commercial facilities and banks without first making reservations. In more than 10 prefectures--mainly metropolitan areas--people can apply online for the coupons in advance to avoid crowds at service counters. Customers receive the coupons after they pay for them at convenience stores. But it is harder for elderly people and others who have difficulties accessing the internet. Therefore, in Gifu and Aichi prefectures, those people are encouraged to apply by phone. Even in some other prefectures, program administrators are considering a way to let people phone into call centers to apply for the coupons. The callers would provide their personal information over the phone, which the operators would input into the online ticket system and then tell the callers their reservation numbers. But an official is concerned that system could lead to problems. “If we are flooded with calls, we might make people wait for a quite long time,” the official said. Some franchises, like fast food restaurants, leave it up to their member shops to decide on their own whether to join the program. The rosters of participating restaurants can vary greatly across areas. The maximum purchase amount is 20,000 yen per person at a time, but a given customer can purchase more later. Those coupons can be used through to the end of March 2021, although for some areas it only runs until the end of February. The coupons are non-refundable. “Their utility depends on how many restaurants that people wish to dine at are available in their areas,” consumer affairs expert Tatsuya Kakita said. “Please purchase an amount that you can finish, after checking how to purchase coupons and what the registered restaurants are in each area.” (This article was written by Akihito Ogawa, Toshinari Takahashi and Noriyuki Kaneta.)",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/13793027

1,Study: School closures stressful for youth who like studying,['By KENJI KATAYAMA/ Staff Writer'],"October 5, 2020 at 07:00 JST"," SAPPORO--Junior high school is already a stressful and awkward time for youths, but this year heaped extra pressure onto the most well-adjusted students, according to a new study. Kids who like studying and going to school found it stressful this year as they were yanked from their normal environments when schools temporarily closed in spring because of the novel coronavirus, the research suggests. But the study results, conducted by researchers at the Hokkaido University Faculty of Education, also showed it was not so hard on students who dislike going to school. “You have to take a delicate approach to the matter, because the stress scores moved in one direction for children who find it fun to study and go to school but shifted in the other direction for those who don’t,” said Hiromichi Kato, an associate professor of developmental psychology. He said parents, educators and caregivers should “take into account differences among individual students when providing care to them” in these kinds of instances. The researchers surveyed about 200 students in their second and third years at a national junior high school in the Tokai region. They asked the students in late May, when they returned to school following a closure over the coronavirus pandemic, about how stressed they felt during the closure. The researchers compared the results against the third semester of the previous school year. In Japan, a school year starts in April and ends in March. May falls in the first semester, which typically lasts from April through July. The third semester of the previous school year lasted between January and March this year. The researchers presented the students with three statements that deal with depression and anxiety, including “I feel anxious” and “I feel sad,” and asked them to rate the statements on a scale of one to five based on how they felt. A score of one stood for “Does not apply at all,” while a score of five meant “Applies strongly.” The stress scores rose between the third semester and the first semester for boys and girls in their second and third years. The mean score for third-year male students rose from 1.36 to 1.83. A separate apathy score, based on statements such as “I cannot concentrate on a single subject” and “I am in no mood for studying,” also rose among both boys and girls of both grades. An earlier study at this same school found stress levels in students tend to rise over the course of a school year. But second-year students’ stress scores during their first semester were clearly higher this school year than the previous one, a phenomenon Kato chalks up to the school closures. The average stress scores, though they were higher than usual, were still lower than the neutral point of three, which stands for “No opinion.” Kato said that means in general, stress levels, which were quite low from the beginning, rose only slightly. The researchers turned to other reference statements, such as “Studying is fun in itself,” to determine which students were more affected. They divided the students into two groups based on how motivated they said they were to learn. The “depression and anxiety” stress score and the apathy score both rose among highly motivated students in their second and third years. The scores dropped among less motivated students, except for students in their third year, who logged a slight increase in the “depression and anxiety” score. The researchers used statements such as “Going to school is fun” to divide the students into two groups based on how well they had adapted to school life. Both stress scores rose in well-adapted students in their second and third years. But children poorly adapting to school showed a general drop in stress scores, except that the “depression and anxiety” score remained unchanged for third-year students and the apathy score rose for second-year students.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/13763754

0,Pandemic deals 4 trillion yen blow to domestic tourism market,['By JUNICHI KAMIYAMA/ Staff Writer'],"October 4, 2020 at 18:25 JST"," With foreign tourists shut out from Japan due to the coronavirus pandemic, about 15 percent of overall domestic travel revenue will be lost between February and December, according to a research institute estimate. The forecast by Resona Research Institute also showed that Tokyo, Osaka and three other prefectures will be hardest hit among Japan’s 47 prefectures, representing 60 percent of the projected losses in consumption from the absence of inbound tourists. The estimate, which was compiled by Hideyuki Araki, a senior researcher at the institute, is based on the assumption that spending among foreign travelers in 2020 remained at the same level as last year. Araki made the projection based on trends in accommodations and spending, which is released by the government’s Japan Tourism Agency. His report showed that a plunge in revenues associated with overseas tourists will have totaled 4,068.2 billion yen ($38,744 million) nationwide in 2020, about 15 percent of a total of 27.9 trillion yen spent on travel in Japan in 2019. By breakdown, sale of goods was the largest of the lost revenues, at 1,442.3 billion yen, followed by accommodations, at 1,181.6 billion yen. That suggests that department stores and drug stores have been battered more than developers of hotels by the halting of foreign arrivals due to the COVID-19 crisis. By prefecture, the impact has been felt more strongly by urban centers. Tokyo, Osaka, Chiba, Kyoto and Hokkaido were the five hardest-hit prefectures, accounting for 60 percent of the country’s lost revenues. When another five prefectures in descending order--Aichi, Nara, Kanagawa, Okinawa and Fukuoka --were added, the top 10 prefectures will represent nearly 80 percent of the total. All these prefectures are home to international airports or host popular tourist destinations, such as World Heritage sites and amusement parks. Araki’s research also found that the value of lost income is larger in the Kanto region, including Tokyo, at 1,506.4 billion yen, while the figure for the Kansai region, Osaka included, was estimated at 1,219 billion yen. Given the size of the local economy of each, however, the Kansai region has been dealt a more serious blow than the Kanto region as the worth in the former accounts for 1.5 percent, compared with 0.7 percent in the latter. One example highlighting the hit is a series of closures of drug stores that had opened catering to foreign visitors in Osaka’s Minami district. “The Kansai region, which is closer to other Asian countries, has become more dependent on inbound tourists after budget carriers began providing service there,” Araki said. “As a result, their absence has been amplified in terms of the economic impact.” The number of overseas tourists to Japan surged after visa requirements were eased and the yen was weakened under the Abe administration that was formed in late 2012. There were 31.88 million foreign arrivals in 2019, about 3.8 times the figure for 2012. A further surge in the number of inbound tourists was expected this year as Tokyo was scheduled to host the Summer Olympics, which were postponed to 2021. But the year-on-year rate in the number of foreign travelers has dropped to more than 99 percent since April after Japan closed its borders due to the pandemic. The government began accepting on Oct. 1 up to 1,000 foreign arrivals a day, primarily mid- and long-term visitors from around the world, for medical and other professional purposes. But as tourists are not included in the easing of travel restrictions, it is difficult to forecast when consumption by inbound tourists will significantly rebound in Japan.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/13787200

1,Governors call for testing boost ahead of easing entry curbs,['By NAMI HAMADA/ Staff Writer'],"September 30, 2020 at 19:30 JST"," The National Governors’ Association is urging the central government to step up measures against the novel coronavirus at airports ahead of the easing of entry restrictions in October. It made the request, along with other emergency recommendations, on Sept. 29 during a videoconference with Yasutoshi Nishimura, the state minister of economic revitalization who is also in charge of the government’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The government will partially lift entry restrictions for all nations from Oct. 1. The association also asked the government to extend the deadline of the “Go To” campaign, which encourages consumer spending to support the travel industry and other sectors hit hard by the pandemic. Travel to and from Tokyo will be included in the “Go To Travel” campaign starting in October. In addition, it requested the government to ensure polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests can be done at all domestic airports that operate flights to and from remote islands, along with international airports in the country. Another request was for the government to take responsibility in securing facilities where foreign tourists to Japan can wait until results of their PCR tests become available, and for those who test positive for the virus to be hospitalized. The association also made other recommendations to ease the burden the pandemic has placed on public health centers. They include urging inbound travelers through multilingual services upon their arrival in Japan to take infection-prevention measures and disseminating that information similarly through Japanese embassies overseas. Another similar request was to provide support for telephone interpretation services for medical care. Tokushima Governor Kamon Iizumi, who is also the president of the association, told reporters after the videoconference that Nishimura had said the government will proceed with anti-virus measures at airports on the assumption that the Tokyo Olympics will be held next summer. Nishimura said the government will start by doing PCR tests on athletes staying in Japan to take part in international sports competitions, which will resume from November, according to Iizumi.

0,Study: Japan among countries with lowest trust levels in vaccines,['By KENTA NOGUCHI/ Staff Writer'],"September 29, 2020 at 19:23 JST"," Japan has one of the lowest levels of confidence in vaccines in the world, according to a new study published in the British medical journal the Lancet. The findings come amid heightened attention on the public’s trust in vaccines, as the world struggles against a deadly coronavirus pandemic. Experts suggested that the low levels of vaccine confidence expressed in Japan may be the result of a past vaccine safety scare, and could stem from there being little information available to people about vaccinations after their childhoods. Researchers from the University of London analyzed survey data of about 280,000 people from 149 countries and regions conducted between 2015 and 2019. The researchers asked respondents three questions: whether they think vaccines are safe, how effective they think vaccines are, and whether they are important for children to have. Respondents' answers were grouped under three categories: they strongly agree, they strongly disagree, or neither. The research period and the frequency of survey administration differed across countries and regions, so the data was statistically processed to make them comparable properly. Only 8.92 percent of Japanese respondents said they strongly agree that vaccines are safe, according to the survey results from the end of 2015. On top of that, only 14.71 percent said they strongly agree that they are effective. Both figures ranked third lowest in the world. On vaccine safety, the second lowest-scoring country was France, at 8.85 percent, while Mongolia ranked the lowest at 8.05 percent. On the question of vaccine effectiveness, the second lowest-ranking country was Mongolia at 13.04 percent, while Morocco scored the lowest at 10.28 percent. But 41.76 percent of Japanese respondents said they strongly agree it is important for children to get vaccinated, although still ranking 12th lowest among the countries surveyed. More Japanese respondents tended to answer “neither” to all three questions than respondents in other countries. Respondents from Argentina ranked in the top three across all three questions, indicating that they put much more trust in vaccines than those in other countries. The rate of people in Japan strongly disagreeing that vaccines are effective saw a statistically significant increase when the survey results were compared from 2015 against 2019. The study highlights Japan as one of the least trusting countries of vaccinations, and suggested that may be partly due to a past vaccine scare, where some people complained of long-term pain after getting vaccinated against HPV, which can cause cervical cancer. The government then stopped proactively recommending the vaccine over these concerns. Japan’s health ministry still considers HPV vaccination to be “a problem in need of being solved,” alongside the spread of the rubella. The World Health Organization (WHO) cited vaccine hesitancy--reluctance or refusal to get vaccinated--last year as one of the top 10 threats to global health. It is becoming a global concern, partly as vaccine-preventable diseases spread in some countries, for example, with measles spreading widely in Europe and elsewhere. “There is little information available on what kinds of vaccines people need to take after their childhood in Japan,” said vaccine expert Takashi Nakano, who is a professor at Kawasaki Medical School in Okayama Prefecture and a pediatric doctor. “People lack knowledge about vaccines.” Since even people in good health take vaccines, they are required to meet higher safety standards than other drugs. “People will tend to have negative opinions about vaccines if they are reported about potential damage to their health with little confidence in them,” Nakano said. “Careful dissemination of information and communication are needed so that people can reflect on the effectiveness and limitations of a vaccine.”",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/13771463
0,Most prefectural governments treat teleworking as ‘business trips’,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"September 29, 2020 at 19:06 JST"," Thirty-two of Japan's 47 prefectural governments treat teleworking as “business trips” with five of them paying a related allowance to their employees working remotely, according to an Asahi Shimbun survey. The survey of the local governments showed they are struggling to find the best way to deal with the new work style, which has rapidly taken root to prevent a spread of novel coronavirus infections. The Chiba prefectural government pays a flat sum of 300 yen ($2.84) a day to its employees who are teleworking to cover their “miscellaneous travel expenses.” Their immediate managers started directing them to work from home after the COVID-19 pandemic hit the country. As of the end of August, the prefectural government had provided some 10 million yen that covers roughly 35,500 days of teleworking to about 5,800 employees. Chiba prefectural government employees who work remotely are considered to be on business trips since the prefectural ordinance on its employees’ office regulations has clauses of “reporting to work,” “traveling on business” and “taking leaves,” but “working from home” is not included. In the case of actual business trips, the prefectural government pays its workers out-of-pocket travel expenses in addition to the 300 yen. If they stay overnight during such trips, they are provided with a fixed 13,100 yen. “The allowance is necessary to cover employees’ communication expenses working on computers at home and phone bills charged for calling the office at the start and end of the workday,” a Chiba prefectural government official said of the 300 yen. The Shimane, Okayama and Yamaguchi prefectural governments also provide 200 to 300 yen a day to their teleworking employees to cover their communication costs for the same reason if their immediate managers approve the workers’ applications for the allowance. The Asahi Shimbun survey found 15 of the 47 prefectural governments treat working remotely as ""teleworking"" or the same as “reporting to work.” The other 32 classify it as business trips. The Chiba, Aichi, Shimane, Okayama and Yamaguchi prefectural governments even pay a business trip-related allowance to their employees who are working remotely. “Some may think employers should shoulder expenses their workers pay during work, but we have our employees bear their own communication costs,” said an official of the Kyoto prefectural government. To ease the burden on teleworking employees, however, employees who are working at the office ring them back when receiving calls from them and the prefectural government lends them laptops, the official said. The Ibaraki prefectural government, which also does not pay teleworkers a business trip-related allowance, has not provided any allowances when its employees travel on business within the prefecture by official car since before the pandemic. “We applied the same rule to teleworking,” an Ibaraki government official said. SAITAMA INTRODUCES PHONE CALL APP Other prefectural governments have changed how to pay such an allowance. The Saitama prefectural government had provided 200 yen a day to employees working remotely to cover their miscellaneous travel expenses, including phone bills, until the end of May. The allowance paid between March and May totaled about 4.96 million yen. But the prefectural government stopped providing it in June after introducing a new system where the government is charged for its workers' phone calls made via an app they install on their personal mobile phones. The Aichi prefectural government has also paid teleworking employees 200 yen a day to cover their miscellaneous travel expenses. But Aichi Governor Hideaki Omura on Sept. 23 said, “The allowance doesn't quite make sense. We’ll stop providing it when we find the best time to do so.” The prefectural government paid about 18 million yen as the allowance between early April and late May alone. Forty-four prefectural governments had adopted teleworking as of March, according to the internal affairs ministry. As part of work style reform, teleworking was introduced on a trial basis several years ago, targeting workers who were raising children or caring for family members. The number of people now working remotely has ballooned amid the pandemic, illuminating the many challenges tied to the work style, such as how to prepare communication devices and whether to provide allowances to teleworkers. The Hiroshima prefectural government said it is conducting a survey of its employees this month on their opinions of the pros and cons of teleworking which they realized while working from home. “Based on the survey results, we’ll further discuss (issues surrounding teleworking) in detail,” a Hiroshima prefectural official said. BUISNESS TRIP ALLOWANCE A 'STOPGAP' MEASURE Jun Nakahara, a professor of human resource development at Rikkyo University, pointed out that prefectural governments are using a several-hundred-yen business trip-related allowance as a stopgap measure to deal with teleworking amid a lack of a system for the new work style. “The governments need to start with understanding the costs that their employees are bearing while working from home,” he said. “They then should stop treating the work style like a business trip and create a proper system that supports teleworkers.” Nakahara also said that the pandemic has provided an opportunity for people to realize the importance of work styles and working environments as many workers have experienced remote working and teleworking. “Workplaces that offer various work styles attract talented people,” he said. “The prefectural governments should consider creating a support system as an investment to survive the pandemic.”",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/13771331

0,Data entry for new infections a pain for medical institutions,['By SHUICHI DOI/ Staff Writer'],"September 29, 2020 at 17:50 JST"," An online system designed to streamline the compilation of data on novel coronavirus infections is failing largely because medical institutions find the entry process troublesome and prefer using faxes, a survey showed. The Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare set up the Health Center Real-time information-sharing System on COVID-19 (HER-SYS) to remove public health centers from the data entry process. Under the previous system, medical institutions faxed information on new infections, including the names of patients and their symptoms, to public health centers. The centers would then send that data to municipal governments. The ministry has instructed medical institutions to enter the information directly into HER-SYS, thereby easing the burden on public health centers and speeding up the data compilation process. However, the ministry’s survey results on Sept. 28 showed that in 60 percent of municipalities, public health centers were still entering “almost all the data.” The centers were handling “70 to 80 percent” of the data in 13 percent of the municipalities, “about 50 percent” of the information in another 13 percent of the municipalities, and “20 to 30 percent” in 9 percent of those surveyed. Only 4 percent of the municipalities said medical institutions were entering almost all of the data on new infections into HER-SYS. The survey was conducted from late August to early September on all 155 municipal governments that were told to use HER-SYS, and 113 of them responded. Of the 318 medical institutions that responded to the survey, only 41 percent said they were entering data into HER-SYS. Many of the institutions that did not use the online system said, “We do not feel any inconvenience in sending the data by paper.” They also complained that there were too many items to enter into the system. Municipal governments said public health centers have also complained about the number of data entries required, including information about people who tested negative for the virus. After receiving such complaints, the health ministry prioritized certain information and said the entry of data about negative test results was unnecessary. “We would like to reduce the burden on public health centers by creating manuals and holding training seminars to show medical institutions how to enter the data more easily,” a ministry official said.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/13770892

The number of workers who were fired or had their contract terminated because of the health crisis stood at 60,439 as of Sept. 23. Since June, 10,000 people were thrown out of work during a roughly four-week period and on Aug. 31 the total figure exceeded 50,000. Since then, 10,000 or so more people found themselves jobless in a roughly three-week span, pointing to a more accelerated pace. Many companies fearing their business prospects remained bleak apparently opted to lay off workers as a second wave of infections took hold this summer. The accelerated pace of unemployment per week as of Sept. 18 was 4,856, the largest since February, when such data became available. The highest number prior to that was 4,811 as of May 29. As of Sept. 18, the restaurant industry logged the biggest loss as it added 2,278 employees from the previous week. The total number of people who lost jobs in the industry reached 9,814, the highest figure among all industries for the first time. It was followed by 9,561 job losses in the manufacturing industry, 8,526 in the retail industry and 7,818 in the hospitality industry. With tourism in the doldrums due to the pandemic, the hospitality industry reported the biggest loss among all industries since the end of May, when the ministry began analyzing industry-based data.

Travelers who will stay in Japan for more than three months for business or other non-tourism purposes are expected to be the first ones allowed to enter the country, according to multiple government sources. Entry restrictions on foreign students will be completely lifted, the sources said. The government will set a maximum daily quota of 1,000 entrants, the sources said. They will be required to self-quarantine for two weeks and follow other health protocols to prevent the novel coronavirus from spreading. The government, in principle, denies entry to foreign nationals, and travel warnings are still in place for 159 countries and regions. However, Japan has negotiated a resumption of business travel with 16 countries and regions mainly in Asia that have shown success in containing the virus. For example, the government in late July resumed travel of long-term residents from seven countries and regions, such as Thailand and Vietnam. Government sources said these eased restrictions so far “have not led to a surge of new COVID-19 cases.” In the meantime, countries in Europe and North America have put pressure on Japan to reopen its borders. In response, the Japanese government decided to expand the “exception” to the current travel restrictions and accept more people who meet certain conditions, such as longer-term visas and favorable health conditions in their home countries. The eased restrictions are targeted at visitors in various fields, such as health care, education and cultural activities, who hold a mid- or long-term visas. The government is expected to partially open the borders for short-term visitors, but not tourists. Entrants will be required to prove they are not infected by taking a virus test before departure and after arrival. After entry, they will be required to self-quarantine for two weeks, the same measures set up for long-term business travelers. They will also need to sign a commitment form and name a “guarantor” in Japan who will ensure they follow the rules. The number of entrants may change, depending on the pandemic situation in each country. Separate from the 1,000-a-day quota, the Japanese government will likely allow entry to up to 1,600 visitors per day from those 16 mainly Asian countries and regions. “Other than the two-week self-quarantine requirement, restrictions on visitors from these 16 countries and regions will be almost fully lifted,” a government source said. Foreign students who have received scholarships and other types of financial support from the Japanese government are already allowed to enter Japan. But pressure has mounted on the government to let in other students before the start of the fall term. In preparation for the reopening, the government will increase testing capabilities at New Chitose, Chubu and Fukuoka airports, in addition to Haneda, Narita and Kansai airports. By the end of November, the government hopes to be able to perform 20,000 tests a day at these airports.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/13752725

U.S. President Donald Trump's government has already secured future supplies through bilateral deals, prompting accusations of selfish behaviour to the detriment of poor countries. China, where the coronavirus began, was also missing on the list of 64 rich nations who joined the so-called COVAX plan to deliver 2 billion vaccine doses round the world by the end of 2021, prioritising healthcare workers and the vulnerable. But alliance officials said dialogue continued with Beijing. The scheme would account for about two-thirds of the world population, according to the WHO and GAVI vaccine alliance, which published the list of signatories after a deadline for binding commitments expired on Friday. Dozens of vaccines are in testing for the coronavirus which has infected about 31 million people globally and killed nearly 1 million, a fifth of those in the United States. ‘THIS IS NOT CHARITY’ ""COVAX will give the world the largest and most diverse portfolio of vaccine candidates,"" WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said at a virtual briefing. ""This is not charity, it's in every country's best interest. We sink or we swim together ... This is not just the right thing to do, it's the smart thing to do."" With some wealthier nations reticent over COVAX, the plan has highlighted the challenge of distributing vaccines equitably around a world of haves and have-nots. The vaccine alliance said it expected another 38 wealthy countries to join the initiative in coming days. It said it had received commitments for $1.4 billion towards vaccine research and development, but a further $700 million-$800 million was urgently needed. The alliance did not say which countries were providing funding while not planning to take supply of vaccines from the scheme. France and Germany have said they will only source potential shots via the European joint procurement scheme. More than 150 potential vaccines are being developed and tested globally, with 38 in human trials.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/13751906

0,Tokyo police go on traffic blitz as fatal motorcycle accidents double,['By EISHI KADO/ Staff Writer'],"September 14, 2020 at 19:01 JST"," Tokyo police said they will start cracking down on problem traffic routes, after the number of motorcycle fatalities in Tokyo so far this year doubled from the same period last year. There were 26 fatalities in the period from January to August, with half of those occurring in the months of July and August alone. The Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department said it is stepping up its policing and traffic instruction presence in areas prone to accidents, as of Sept. 14. Police aim to instill a sense of concern in drivers just ahead of the fall travel season. “There are many motorcycle accidents in September every year,” a metropolitan police official said. “We will urge drivers to be more cautious through stepping up our presence so that they can safely and securely drive without becoming overconfident in their skills.” Tokyo police said they are beefing up their traffic measures through Sept. 18. They will be deploying more police motorcycles and cruisers onto streets where accidents frequently occur during commute times. They also said police cars will in some cases drive while flashing their red lights to call for more careful driving. There were 90 traffic fatalities from accidents in Tokyo between January and August, police said. Fatalities have dropped in 29 prefectures across Japan, year on year, due to the stay-at-home measures put in place to prevent the coronavirus from spreading. But the number of traffic fatalities actually increased in Tokyo, up by 17. The jump in motorcycle fatalities pushed the number of total traffic fatalities upward, Tokyo police said. The frequency of accidents remained around the same level as the previous year until June. But then it rapidly increased in the months of July and August. Tokyo police said it is hard to say exactly why the number has increased, but provided a few possible reasons. One potential cause is that more people are avoiding using trains and instead riding motorcycles because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Another is that after the overall traffic volume dropped because of the pandemic, drivers began to speed up. Police also suggested that drivers may simply not be driving carefully enough on the roads. The number of injuries from motorcycle accidents decreased year on year, but it has still reached as high as 2,787. Of the 26 motorcycle fatalities in Tokyo so far this year, there were seven people each in their 20s and 50s, which were the highest numbers. There were four people in their 40s and four were older than 60, while three were in their 30s. One high school student was killed in a motorcycle accident. Eleven deaths were single-vehicle accidents caused by speeding or other reasons. Six cases occurred during right-hand turns. Five cases were collisions.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/13726868
1,Many children’s cafeterias remain closed despite the kids put at risk,['By YOSHICHIKA YAMANAKA/ Staff Writer'],"September 14, 2020 at 18:46 JST"," Yoko Yuki used to feed hungry children at her cafeteria in Osaka's Minato Ward until the new coronavirus pandemic forced her to close it in March. “I really want to reopen it, but have no courage to do so,” said Yuki, 58, who operates the children's cafeteria Tanaka Shokudo. She used to offer meals to children at a nearby public facility on Saturdays at lunchtime once a month and served some 300 people on a busy day. Yuki planned to resume operations in October, but community infections are still spreading. She said she decided not to reopen until the end of this winter since her staff and parents of users of her cafeteria suggested, “It’s still too early to reopen it, isn’t it?” Tanaka Shokudo is among many children’s cafeterias that have been forced to temporarily close due to the COVID-19 pandemic and still are unable to reopen. The cafeterias not only provide meals to children of financially struggling families but also help detect child abuse and neglect cases. If the situation continues, that could result in undermining children’s well-being. CLOSED CAFETERIAS CANNOT WATCH OVER KIDS Minna Shokudo Mure no Kai (Association of Mure: cafeteria for all), a children’s cafeteria in Osaka’s Sumiyoshi Ward, stopped offering in-house meals in April. Instead, it now distributes take-out bento boxed meals to children once a month. It prepared about 40 bento on one weekend in early August, and children and their mothers started arriving at the cafeteria in the early afternoon to receive the boxed lunches and snacks. But Yumiko Asada, 71, representative of the cafeteria, expressed concern about the current situation. “We can’t spend enough time talking with each other while we are operating this way,"" she said. ""Users may feel less connected to a local community.” Kaori Iwabashi, 49, whose third-grade son used to eat at the cafeteria, said, “This is a place where children can develop a friendship with other kids outside their schools and interact with local residents. I want the cafeteria to reopen.” Okinawa Prefecture has the highest ratio of children’s cafeterias in proportion to the number of elementary schools in the country. A survey conducted by the prefectural government in mid-August found 60 percent of 203 such cafeterias in the prefecture closed temporarily, including those that partially suspended operations, such as opening less frequently than before. According to the social welfare council in Aomori Prefecture, 80 percent of the 29 children’s cafeterias in the prefecture could not reopen as of Aug. 20. In Yamanashi Prefecture, all 30 such eateries in the prefecture reportedly suspended providing meals at cafeterias as of Sept. 7. According to the Nagoya-based Aichi Kodomo Shokudo Network (Network of children’s cafeterias in Aichi), less than 10 percent of its 82 members are serving meals at their indoor cafeterias. The Tokyo-based nonprofit organization Musubie, which supports children’s cafeterias around the country, cited four major reasons why such eateries have been unable to reopen. Private houses and facilities where they provide meals will become the so-called 3Cs--confined, crowded and close-contact settings; staff members are worried about getting infected because they are elderly; operators run out of money due to costly infection prevention measures, including disinfection; and they cannot secure places to offer meals because of restrictions on the use of public facilities. In June, Musubie surveyed 238 operators of children’s cafeterias in 37 prefectures through major networks of such eateries across the country. It found more than 80 percent of them temporarily closed their cafeterias with nearly half saying they had “yet to decide when to reopen.” According to Musubie, some operators were forced to postpone their reopenings that were initially scheduled for summer or autumn. “If the cafeterias continue to remain closed, they cannot sufficiently listen to children’s problems,” said a Musubie staff member. “Children could face a risk of being socially isolated.” Children’s cafeterias not only provide meals to children in need but also help monitor their well-being and serve as a place to interact with other people. “Local residents will become unable to watch over children in their community as carefully as they used to,” said Makoto Yuasa, a specially appointed professor of assistive technology at the University of Tokyo, who serves as chief director of Musubie. FEWER DONATIONS HAMPER OPERATION Some children’s cafeterias have remained open despite all the difficulties during the pandemic. One of the operators of such eateries is Oita-based Sumire gakkyu (Sumire class), which runs seven children’s cafeterias in Oita Prefecture. The operator has continued providing study support and meals to children by taking thorough infection prevention measures, such as checking users’ body temperatures and disinfecting the site. “As many people refrain from going out, some children have fewer places where they feel safe and more kids are using our cafeterias,” said Tomio Fujii, 73, chief director of Sumire gakkyu. “Now, more than ever, we need to provide places for children since many of them have family problems.” But infection prevention measures, including disinfection, cost the operator about 50,000 yen ($471) a month. It is facing a tougher financial situation than a normal year as it has also received around 3 million yen less from companies and other donors due to economic fallout from the pandemic. The operator plans to hold a charity concert in October to raise funds.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/13726682
1,Man whose son got virus seeks to end rumors with newspaper flier,['By KAZUHIRO ITAMI/ Staff Writer'],"September 14, 2020 at 18:42 JST"," MITSUKE, Niigata Prefecture--A man here whose son tested positive for the novel coronavirus resorted to asking a newspaper to distribute fliers to dispel false rumors that took a toll on people and businesses that have nothing to do with the case. “This is what I feel right now,” reads the headline of the flier made by Hidaka Sato, printed on B-4 paper. “Only our family members were in close contact with my son and nobody else,"" the 57-year-old pharmacy owner, who resides in Mitsuke, Niigata Prefecture, wrote. ""All of our family members took a (polymerase chain reaction) test and were confirmed negative for the novel coronavirus. We do not pose an infection risk to others.” Sato on Aug. 29 asked the local newspaper The Niigata Nippo to distribute the flier as an insert in the paper, read by 14,000 or so subscribers in Mitsuke and some parts of neighboring Nagaoka city. Ten days earlier, his son who lives in Tokyo tested positive for the virus while he was visiting Sato in the town. Rumors immediately began spreading, including unfounded ones. Hidaka's older sister Chiharu Sato, 59, who manages the pharmacy with him, got a call from an acquaintance, pressing, “Is it true that someone there tested positive?” It was even before Sato relayed the news to her. The pharmacy’s phone began ringing non-stop after that, with callers blaming the family for bringing the virus to the town. The store also received numerous emails accusing them of causing trouble. Sato reached the limit of his tolerance when he learned that businesses that he had never even heard of had become a target of groundless rumors connected to his family. “This place got visited by sanitation workers,” one rumor went. “Their staff took PCR tests,” another insisted. The businesses lost sales due to the rumors, Sato also heard. He knew that the rumors were completely untrue, but he found he could not just ignore them. Thus, he said, he called some of the businesses and apologized. “I was bothered by guilt,” Sato said. “They did nothing wrong, yet they suffer from false rumors.” Finally, he decided to make the flier, to avoid causing damage to “people and businesses who have no connection to my family.” Doing so would be worthwhile, he thought, “even if it would only slightly"" ease the pain of the businesses, Sato said. It was not his first effort to refute the rumors. Sato started addressing them just two days after his son tested positive for the virus on his Facebook account. Nobody in the restaurants that Sato and his family had been to were deemed to have had close contact with his son, the public health center concluded. Sato posted a note at the pharmacy saying his family members had been proven not to be carrying the virus and customers need not to worry about contracting it. But his efforts made no difference. Sato still received calls, in which his neighbors complained over how much their lives had been disrupted. One caller said a nursery refused to take care of their child for two weeks. Another caller said they were told by coworkers in their office, “Do not to come close to me.” “Facebook can only reach certain people,” Sato said he realized. He then turned to traditional media, making the newspaper insert. Sato contacted Toru Murakami, a 40-year-old illustrator in the city, and asked him to design the flier. Murakami in July posted a five-frame comic strip on the city government’s Facebook account, urging residents to be kind to COVID-19 patients. Sato became aware of it after it was picked up by news media. Murakami said he was surprised that what he had heard about the case from others was entirely different from what Sato told him. They held nothing back in designing the flier, to best address what they thought were the public’s most pressing questions. The flier discloses Sato’s full name as well as Chiharu’s, the pharmacy’s name and an email address where the public can make an inquiry. “Anonymous information can be deemed unreliable and would not be enough to protect people and businesses who have nothing to do with (us) from the damages caused by false rumors,” Sato said. Murakami drew a portrait of Sato and Chiharu on the flier to accompany the information. Sato did apologize for one thing in the insert, the fact that his son traveled from Tokyo to his hometown. “We deeply regret that and accept (the public’s) criticisms,” Sato wrote. The distribution of the flier appears to have worked to some extent toward setting things straight. Calls and emails to the pharmacy from people who just hurl abusive language at the family have declined, according to Chiharu. They still hear from some angry callers and writers, she said, but “now they give us a fuller explanation of why they are so angry.” Chiharu said what the family has gone through “can serve as a useful reference for the next case.” “When the news breaks that the city has another COVID-19 patient, this flier might keep a similar situation at bay, I hope,” Chiharu said.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/13726570

1,ECMO vehicles hit the road to save lives during virus pandemic,['By KAI ICHINO/ Staff Writer'],"September 14, 2020 at 07:00 JST"," During the COVID-19 outbreak, Takayuki Ogura would often search for a hospital that could take the most critical patients, but couldn't find one that would accept them. He was the point man of the ECMOnet, a volunteer group of intensive care doctors and other medical staff, which arranged to transport and hospitalize patients with severe symptoms in need of treatment. So, Ogura, head of the medical emergency center at Saiseikai Utsunomiya Hospital, had to select patients for transfer who were likely to survive, including those who had been on a ventilator for no longer than 10 days. “I had to make difficult decisions,” he added. For COVID-19 patients in dire straits, their last lifeline often comes through being put on an extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, an ECMO lung bypass machine. However, with only about 200 of the life-support units available in Tokyo, it's often a race for doctors such as Ogura to find one for patients in critical condition. Speeding to the rescue is an ECMO-equipped vehicle that can transport these patients safely to a medical facility where the life-saving equipment is available. In late February, doctors with ECMOnet transferred a patient about 350 kilometers from Nagoya to Tokyo via an ECMO vehicle. Osamu Nishida, president of the Japanese Society of Intensive Care Medicine (JSICM), said the ECMO-equipped vehicle has great potential. An ECMO vehicle can transfer patients to wider areas, and patients will have more choices to select medical institutions for their hospitalization. Medical institutions can maintain sufficient medical staff and beds in their respective intensive care units by transferring critical patients. “Even if there is only one ECMO vehicle available for one medical zone, the area will have a much less medical burden,” Nishida said. “An ECMO vehicle will be the quickest and the most effective measure to protect the capacity of ICUs.” The Japan Medical Association urged the central government in May to deploy more ECOM vehicles across the nation. The association hopes that one ECMO vehicle will be placed at each leading medical institution in regions from Hokkaido to Okinawa Prefecture. A total of 20 vehicles are forecast to be equipped across Japan. The special ECMO vehicle is 1.1 times larger than conventional emergency vehicles. It has enough space to accommodate multiple doctors and clinical technicians. It also has sufficient batteries for powering an ECMO, which helps the treatment for patients who are infected with the novel coronavirus and have severe symptoms. An ECMO removes carbon dioxide from blood taken out of blood vessels and adds oxygen and circulates it back to the blood vessels. It is effective in helping patients recover lung functioning that has been weakened due to COVID-19. However, to operate an ECMO, two thick tubes need to be inserted into a patient, so there are risks of bleeding or infection. Inaddition to facilities such as ICUs, skilled and experienced medical staff are necessary for the proper operation of an ECMO. Only a limited number of medical institutions can operate the equipment properly. At times during the first infection wave in the spring, there were instances that an ECMO could not be utilized even though it was available. In normal times, an ECMO is often used for a short period during heart surgeries. However, the life-support machines are now used for the long-term treatment of COVID-19 patients. Although there are about 200 ECMO units in Tokyo, fewer machines could be used for COVID-19 patients due to the lack of doctors who can operate them. ECMOnet is holding training sessions across the nation to increase the number of medical staff who can operate the equipment. The survival rate of patients using an ECMO unit in Japan exceeded 70 percent as of August, higher than those of other countries. The first infection wave swamped Tokyo in April, with the number of infected patients in hospital in the capital surpassing 2,800 at one point. The number of patients with severe symptoms also increased. According to the database of three medical societies, including the JSICM, as of April 24, in the capital the highest number of 89 patients were in intensive care on ECMO or ventilator units. As of Aug. 23, the number of such patients was 28. According to research conducted by JSICM in February, there are at least 1,400 ECMO units in Japan, but Tokushima and Fukui prefectures only have 10 units or fewer. The availability of ECMO differs greatly among regions. Although the number of ECMOs are increasing, it will be difficult to treat patients with severe symptoms if their number also soars. Therefore, the transport of patients in wider areas is promising because they can be transferred to medical institutions in neighboring prefectures.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/13687871

The government will officially announce the addition following a meeting of its council to deal with the novel coronavirus pandemic, to be held on Sept. 11. Tours that have already been booked will be subject to discounts under the campaign as long as they depart on or after Oct. 1. Economic revitalization minister Yasutoshi Nishimura said on Sept. 10 he wanted the council ""to discuss if it is appropriate to add Tokyo to the campaign.” The Tokyo metropolitan government that day lifted its request for residents not to travel outside the capital due to the pandemic. In response, the central government decided to put the issue on the council’s agenda. The council has assessed that the pandemic’s second wave that hit Tokyo in June and then spread around the country peaked in late July and has since been on a slow decline. The central government agreed with the assessment and was waiting for the Tokyo officials’ decision to lift the travel restrictions to add the capital to the promotional campaign. Some argued it should do so before the four-day holiday weekend starting on Sept. 19. But the central government has decided to start it in October, considering the necessity for preparation time. The campaign aims to boost the tourism industry, which has been hit hard since the pandemic broke out. But the number of new COVID-19 cases in Tokyo has not died down. Its daily count on Sept. 10 was 276. Adding the capital to the campaign may accelerate the movement of people in and out of Tokyo. Some worry that will cause a spike in new cases.

0,A hand-held fan is geisha’s only protection against virus,['By HIDEO SATO/ Staff Writer'],"September 9, 2020 at 08:00 JST"," KYOTO--A geisha with her face covered by a plain surgical face mask hardly fits the traditional dainty image of the practitioners of the centuries-old art form that is largely hidden from the public eye. Traditional hand-held fans are considered much more suitable for elegant geisha and their ""maiko"" apprentices in this age of health concerns over the new coronavirus. This, then, explains recent steps taken by the Kyoto Sensu Uchiwa Shoko Kyodo Kumiai (Kyoto folding and round fan commercial and industrial cooperative association). Comprising businesses and craftsmen who produce and sell folding and round fans, the organization created and distributed Kyoto-style fans with mortar applied to one surface to five historic entertainment zones in this old city. As mortar is said to have anti-virus effects, the association expects geisha and their trainees to use the fans to cover their mouths as part of efforts to contain the novel coronavirus. “I hope the practice of preventing droplets from leaving mouths (with the fan) will become common,” said Satoshi Aiba, chairman of the fan association. The product was developed by Shimizushouten Ltd., an association member based in Ukyo Ward here. The backs of the fans are coated with mortar to dissolve the protein composition of viruses and bacilli to render them inactive, according to representatives. In the first round of the campaign, 200 Kyoto-style fans decorated with designs inspired by the “chimaki” amulet and “chinowa” ring believed to ward off evil were sent to the five nightlife districts so each of them could receive 40 of them. On Aug. 19, Aiba handed his association’s fans to Masano, 20, a geisha apprentice from Kyoto’s Gion-Higashi district, as well as others at the Gion Corner tourism facility in the ancient capital’s Higashiyama Ward. The special fan is to be released for general sale for 5,500 yen ($51.85), including tax.

The West Japan Railway Co. (JR West) train was delayed due to the novel coronavirus pandemic. To reduce the risks of exposing passengers to the virus, air purifiers and ventilation devices are installed on the train, while partitions are set up in a free space in the No. 4 car and elsewhere, according to the railway operator. ""We have introduced infection prevention measures to ensure the safety and security for passengers.

0,COVID-19 fatality rate in second wave one-sixth that of spring,['By HIROSHI ISHIZUKA/ Staff Writer'],"September 5, 2020 at 17:04 JST"," Improved treatment was among factors that played a key role in reducing the fatality rate of COVID-19 during the second wave to just one-sixth of the levels recorded in the first wave this spring. The National Institute of Infectious Diseases reported Sept. 4 a sharp decrease in the fatality rate across all age groups. Even among those aged 70 and older, the fatality rate was only one-third the level in spring. Among reasons given for the falling fatality rates were the establishment of treatment methods as well as the many cases of individuals with no or minor symptoms who were confirmed through expanded testing. The institute conducted an analysis to calculate an estimated fatality rate based on reports submitted by prefectural governments. The second wave is judged to have occurred between June and Aug. 19 when the fatality rate over all age groups was 0.9 percent. In the first wave between Jan. 16, when the first confirmed COVID-19 infection was reported in Japan, and May, the fatality rate was 5.8 percent. For those aged 70 and older, the fatality rate during the first wave was 24.5 percent, but in the second wave the figure dropped to 8.7 percent. The fatality rate in the second wave among those under 50 stood at zero while the rate was 0.2 percent in the first wave. Motoi Suzuki, who heads the Infectious Diseases Surveillance Center of the National Institute of Infectious Diseases, noted that fatalities had fallen since July. As reasons for the decrease in the fatality rate, Suzuki cited expanded testing for COVID-19, better treatment methods and the fact that many new cases in the second wave involved young people. He also cited better methods to prevent infections from spreading within hospitals or care facilities for the elderly as well as a comparatively higher ratio of patients without pre-existing health conditions.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/13699854
1,New procedures to test and treat COVID-19 to start from October,['By KOHEI TOMIDA/ Staff Writer'],"September 5, 2020 at 15:30 JST"," The health ministry, mindful of the looming influenza season, revised its procedures to determine if a person with symptoms should be tested and treated for COVID-19. Until now, those suffering from a fever or coughing were advised to contact the local public health office where staff decide if treatment and testing for the novel coronavirus should be done at a medical institution. Under the guidelines announced Sept. 4, an individual can phone his or her family doctor or nearby medical institution for a consultation before a decision is made on whether testing and treatment is needed at a designated medical institution. The change is aimed at avoiding the logjam that prevailed in the first wave of COVID-19 this spring and kept anxious people waiting often for days before they were tested. The new procedure could begin as early as October, in time for the influenza season when more people are expected to visit medical institutions for fear they have COVID-19. The health ministry the same day notified prefectural authorities nationwide to set up appropriate medical structures before the end of October to allow for the guidelines to be implemented. Prefectural governments will designate medical institutions that can test and treat for both COVID-19 and influenza. Those institutions will be allowed to use simplified antigen testing that takes less time than polymerase chain reaction tests to determine if an individual has COVID-19. After a person with suspect symptoms calls his or her family doctor by phone, the individual can make a reservation to be tested and treated by that physician if the clinic is a designated one. If it is not, the doctor will recommend an institution that has been designated. Procedures will be implemented so all medical institutions in whatever region will know which ones have been designated. It will be up to local governments to decide whether or not to publicize which medical institutions have been designated. Some may not want that information to be widely known due to fears about negative publicity. It is not clear which medical institutions will be designated for testing and treatment of COVID-19. However, health minister Katsunobu Kato told a Sept. 4 news conference that he hoped prefectural governments would designate as many medical institutions as possible. He also revealed that financial support is being considered for institutions that are designated. Public health offices will still take phone calls on weekends and at night when medical institutions are not open from people who fear they might have been infected. Those health offices will then refer the individual to a designated institution. The current practice of those offices deciding whether a person should go to a medical institution for a diagnosis about COVID-19 will cease. The institutions where individuals had been diagnosed and tested until now will concentrate on providing in-patient care for those with COVID-19.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/13699778

0,Imperial couple grappling with ways to reach out in pandemic,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"September 4, 2020 at 15:05 JST"," Stuck at home because of the novel coronavirus, Emperor Naruhito and Empress Masako are seeking new ways to reach out to the public to offer reassurances and encouragement. Living in near-""lockdown"" in the moated palace in central Tokyo is proving especially galling as meeting people in times of distress has been a hallmark of imperial family life since the Heisei Era (1989-2019). The emperor and empress have already had to sharply curtail their public outings and other domestic duties. The Imperial Household Agency is keen for the couple to avoid congested situations where they come into close contact with people or find themselves in venues that are poorly ventilated. Naruhito and Masako were forced to cancel four scheduled visits to regional areas to attend annual events such as the National Arbor Day Festival and the National Sports Festival. Naruhito also postponed a planned visit to Britain that would have been his first overseas trip since ascending the Chrysanthemum Throne. Given the unprecedented atmosphere facing the imperial family, the Imperial Household Agency took the unusual step of releasing a comment made by Naruhito on May 20 when he met with Yoshiharu Otsuka, president of the Japanese Red Cross Society, and others at the Imperial Palace. “I believe it is important to surmount the difficult situation we face by bringing together all of our abilities and feelings as one in moving toward overcoming the infectious disease,” Naruhito told the gathering. The meeting was one of many that allow the emperor to listen to what experts have to say about various issues facing the nation. Those sessions are, in principle, off the record so it was highly unusual for the agency to reveal what the emperor said. The drastic reduction in activities on the part of the imperial family appears to have been behind the decision to release Naruhito’s comment. In addition to the planned visit to Britain by the imperial couple, a ceremony officially proclaiming Fumihito as crown prince has also been postponed because of the COVID-19 pandemic. A high-ranking agency official admitted that finding ways to convey to the public the thoughts held by Naruhito and Masako about wanting to share in their joys and sorrows had proven difficult. Since April, Naruhito and Masako have heard from numerous experts and specialists dealing with issues raised by the novel coronavirus pandemic. Those individuals spoke about the ramifications on the economy as well as what is being done at day-care centers and in providing for those facing difficulties in their daily lives. But getting word out to the public about the concern the emperor and empress feel has fallen somewhat short in the opinion of some officials. A number of experts have suggested that Naruhito follow the example of Britain’s Queen Elizabeth and deliver a video message to the public, calling on the public to work together. However, an Imperial Household Agency source said, “The coronavirus pandemic is a theme closely entwined with politics, so we have to ensure he is not being used in a political manner.” With these concerns in mind, Naruhito made his first public comment about the COVID-19 pandemic during his address at the memorial ceremony for the war dead on Aug. 15, when he said, “I sincerely hope that we all work together hand in hand to overcome this difficult situation and continue to seek happiness of the people and world peace.” The mention of the coronavirus pandemic stands out in the message because past addresses never included any reference to natural disasters or the social situation prevailing at the time. At a news conference, Kenji Ikeda, vice grand steward at the Imperial Household Agency, said: “There was a large effect on the holding of the ceremony itself because many relatives decided not to attend because of the spread of COVID-19 infections. It was only natural to include that reference in the message meant for the souls of the war dead.” Imperial household members have begun showing an increased tendency to participate in online events. Naruhito and Masako recently listened in to an international conference on the theme of preventing water disasters while the pandemic rages. Crown Prince Fumihito has held videoconferences with people in various sectors affected by the pandemic. But it remains to be seen if such online measures will be used between the imperial family and the public. Yasuhiko Nishimura, grand steward of the Imperial Household Agency, said: “I believe the feelings of (the imperial couple) will not be transmitted online. While online communications might be used to listen to explanations, it will likely be difficult to use that in place of their activities.” Takeshi Hara, a professor of history of Japanese political thought at the Open University of Japan, is closely following how Naruhito decides to pass on future messages. “Through the response to the coronavirus pandemic, it might be possible to observe early on how the image of the emperor during the Reiwa Era differs from that of the Heisei Era,” Hara said in reference to the way Naruhito's parents, Emperor Emeritus Akihito and Empress Emerita Michiko, went out of their way to meet with people affected by natural disasters.

0,Experts urge caution for some areas amid drop in virus cases,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"September 3, 2020 at 16:17 JST"," New COVID-19 cases are slowly declining across most of Japan, but some prefectures, including Fukuoka and Okinawa, need to be closely monitored, according to a panel of experts advising the health ministry. The panel, which met on Sept. 2, also reported numbers suggesting the fatality rate was lower in the second wave of infections in the summer than during the first wave, which had spread in the spring. The experts said new cases appear to have been slowly decreasing nationwide since the end of July. That is according to an analysis based on the dates when patients began showing symptoms, rather than when their infections were officially confirmed. The number of new infections that can spread from just one infected person, called the effective reproduction number, remains close to one in Tokyo. But the panel urged caution for other areas, raising concerns that the number is possibly higher than one in Fukuoka and Okinawa prefectures. Even though Osaka Prefecture’s number is currently below one, experts said they are closely watching the situation because the number of patients in serious condition is still high. The panel’s analysis is based on data collected through the middle of August. They said it will still take a couple more weeks to gauge the effect of people traveling across prefectures before and during the traditional Bon holiday week, roughly from Aug. 13 to Aug. 16. The panel presented a fresh data analysis by the National Institute of Infectious Diseases at the meeting that shows a drop in the mortality rate from the virus when comparing the figures in May and August. The report said the mortality rate in August was 0.9 percent, compared with 7.2 percent in May, across all age groups. As for patients aged 70 or older, the figure in August was 8.1 percent, 17.4 percentage points lower than in May. Takaji Wakita, who heads both the advisory panel and the institute, suggested possible reasons for the drop include health care workers detecting more patients with mild symptoms, including the elderly, due to an increase in testing, and improved treatment. But he cautioned that the institute’s assessment is not definitive. A separate study shows the May and August mortality rates are about the same for senior citizens. “We need to do extra analysis to determine which finding is accurate,” he said. Health ministry officials said at the meeting they are preparing a new testing regime for the upcoming flu season. They laid out a plan to establish a system capable of testing 200,000 people a day for the coronavirus to prepare for simultaneous outbreaks of flu and COVID-19 in winter. The planned testing system will allow people to take tests for both the novel coronavirus and the flu. Medical experts note that it is difficult to distinguish between patients with these two viruses simply based on their symptoms. The system would employ easy-to-use antigen test kits that involve nasal swabs, according to ministry officials. The results would be available in about half an hour. Doctors would decide whether a patient should be tested for both respiratory illnesses. Ministry officials also said a new working group will be set up under the advisory panel. It will review the current setup of requiring patients to be hospitalized under the infectious disease law if they are diagnosed with the novel coronavirus. Nobuhiko Okabe, a doctor who serves as the director-general of the Kawasaki City Institute for Public Health, will chair the group. The group will include infectious disease experts and doctors treating COVID-19 patients, as well as members of the advisory panel.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/13693422

0,Temp workers bear brunt as firms cut staff over COVID-19,['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"September 2, 2020 at 18:11 JST"," Temporary workers in Japan are being jettisoned en masse by companies, with 160,000 fewer holding jobs in July than at the same time a year ago, according to the central government’s latest data. The drop recorded in a labor survey released by the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications on Sept. 1 i s the largest since 2014 when comparable data became available. “I have received many reports from temporary staffing companies and organizations. But the survey shows the number of temporary workers decreased by 160,000,” Labor Minister Katsunobu Kato said Sept. 1, expressing concern at a news conference held after a Cabinet meeting. Kato said the ministry, preparing for the next temporary worker contract renewal period at the end of September, urged businesses at the end of August not to let temporary workers go and to utilize a government subsidy to keep them. Experts and workers' support groups had warned that temporary workers would face a crisis near the end of June, predicting many employers would be unlikely to renew the three-month contracts that came up for renewal at that time. Their predictions became reality. A woman in her 40s originally from the Philippines was employed as a temporary worker at an automobile parts company in Aichi Prefecture. At the end of April, her boss told her, “The first day after the Golden Week holidays, you're on the night shift.” But right before the company was to resume post-holiday operations in May, her temporary staffing company informed her, “Your contract has been terminated.” A sharp decrease in demand curtailed production at the company, apparently affecting the factory where she worked. “I’m on welfare now,” the woman said. “Does (the company) just get rid of me as soon as I'm not needed?” She is a single mother raising a son attending high school. She is also burdened with having to cover a relative’s expensive medical fees. Without the factory job, she doesn't have enough to live on. To get by, the woman applied for social assistance with the help of the Nagoya Fureai Union. Temporary workers have been “axed altogether in the automobile industry,” a union representative said. “It's unlikely the labor situation will return to pre-coronavirus levels,” the representative added. The labor ministry is also worried about the crisis. Kato at the end of May implored temporary staffing companies and other related business groups not to terminate workers' contracts so easily and to maintain employment as much as possible. He urged temporary staffing companies in particular to keep contracts alive even if they are unable to find a new placement for temporary workers. Kato asked them to use the central government’s emergency subsidy for the pandemic and put temporary workers “on leave.” But the minister’s request has no teeth. The ministry said it does not know how many staffing companies, if any, have utilized the subsidy and kept a temporary worker employed, even if they cannot find a new placement for the worker. Temporary workers who have lost jobs and their supporters at the end of July urged the ministry to take further measures, saying that staffing companies have not followed the minister’s requests.

0,"August worst for Japan virus cases, accounts for half of total",['THE ASAHI SHIMBUN'],"September 2, 2020 at 17:59 JST"," With 32,161 cases in August, fresh COVID-19 infections nationwide hit a record for any month since January, a tally by The Asahi Shimbun shows. The figure was 1.8 times the number in July when there were 17,623 cases. The data also showed that the figure for August represents nearly half of the accumulated total since January, when cases were first reported. New cases are now slowly declining from early August, but 10 deaths or more from COVID-19 have been reported daily since then. The data was compiled from reports by local authorities and other sources. As of the end of August, accumulated total cases exceeded 68,000 nationwide. Surges began in July and there were several days that saw more than 1,500 new cases between late July and early August. The count in August was 2.6 times that of April, when a state of emergency was declared by the central government. Outbreaks were first reported in large cities, but spread to local regions as well. Although a national state of emergency was lifted in late May, Okinawa and Aichi prefectures issued their own states of emergency in late July due to new infections. The Tokyo metropolitan government also made fresh calls on ""izakaya"" pubs and other venues to reduce operating hours to help contain the spread. The number of people traveling outside their prefecture was smaller than usual during the second week of August, when the traditional Bon festival fell, due to growing calls for vigilance. From Aug. 22 onward, new daily cases were below 1,000 across Japan, showing a downward trend. But fatalities spiked in August. There were 287 deaths in August, compared with 39 in July. The increase was attributed to the transmission of the virus to more middle-aged or senior citizens, who are more prone to develop serious health conditions than other age groups. Cases of death remain high, with 20 reported on Aug. 28.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/13690693

There were 170 new cases in the capital on Sept. 1. There were also 29 patients considered with severe symptoms requiring the use of a ventilator or an extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) device, which circulates blood through an artificial lung. The figure was a decrease of three from the previous day. Meanwhile, a family of four on Oshima island of the Izu chain was confirmed infected with COVID-19. The last time a resident of an outlying island was found infected was in May on Mikurajima island. According to Oshima town officials, the four cases are parents in their 30s and two children under 10. Antigen tests by Sept. 1 confirmed the infections. It is still unclear how the family became infected because they had not left the island. The four will be flown by helicopter to a hospital in Tokyo for treatment. The local public health office is looking into anyone the family of four may have come into close contact with. For the capital as a whole on Sept. 1, 48 of the new cases were of people in their 20s, 38 in their 30s, 28 in their 40s, 17 in their 50s, 15 in their 60s, 10 teenagers, six in their 70s, five in their 80s, two under 10 and one in their 90s.

0,Tokyo partners with Line for new COVID-19 checkup system,['By RIHITO KARUBE/ Staff Writer'],"August 31, 2020 at 17:20 JST"," Health centers in Tokyo will soon have a new tool at their disposal to check on COVID-19 patients recovering at home in the capital. The Tokyo metropolitan government is introducing a new health checkup service through Line Corp.’s popular free messaging app. It is aimed at making the process easier for both patients and health care workers. The service will be available starting on Sept. 1 for some patients infected with the novel coronavirus recovering at home, officials said. The Tama Tachikawa health center, which is responsible for six cities in the western part of Tokyo, including Tachikawa city, will be the first to start using the service with its patients. Officials from the Tokyo metropolitan government, which announced the details on Aug. 28., said the plan is to expand the service across the capital after that. The government has been requesting that patients who have the virus, and show either mild or no symptoms, isolate themselves at accommodation facilities. But some patients, such as parents raising their children at home, prefer to recover in their own homes. Health centers call those patients twice a day to check on their condition, which has grown into a burdensome administrative task and can be troublesome for patients as well. The new Line service will send various health queries to the patients, such as, “Do you have red eyes?” and “Do you have an appetite?” Patients can then respond either yes or no, officials explained. When health center officials identify through the service that someone’s condition may be worsening, they will call the patients to check on them in greater detail.",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/13684298

1,"Japanese wear face masks, but the main reason is just to fit in",['By MASANORI KOBAYASHI/ Staff Writer'],"August 31, 2020 at 07:00 JST"," Japanese people have taken to wearing face masks during the pandemic, but the main reason for doing so has more to do with going along with others than preventing the coronavirus from spreading, a new study says. Peer pressure emerged as the dominant factor for wearing face masks amid the health crisis in Japan, according to the results of a survey administered by academics. A research group headed by Kazuya Nakayachi, a professor at Doshisha University’s Faculty of Psychology, published its findings in the Swiss scientific journal Frontiers in Psychology on Aug. 4. “Wearing masks is recommended to stop the virus from spreading to others, but our research suggests wearers rarely use masks for that purpose,” Nakayachi said. “Most of them simply want to don masks just because others do.” The researchers surveyed 1,000 Japanese citizens online in March about how often and why they wear face coverings. The survey found that most people wear the protective gear, even though masks offer the wearers themselves limited protection. The results show a majority of respondents, or 51.2 percent, said they “usually” wear masks amid the pandemic, followed by 31.4 percent who said they “sometimes” wear them. Only 17.4 percent said they do “not at all” wear masks. The survey quizzed respondents in six areas: the danger of contracting the virus; preventing oneself from becoming infected; protecting others from infection; taking the maximum possible precautions against the virus; peer pressure; and easing anxiety. Respondents rated their reasons for wearing masks on a scale of 1 to 5, with 5 points representing the reason that “best explains” their motive, while 1 point would signal that they do “not at all” agree with the statement. The most popular answer was “peer pressure,” which averaged 3.47 points. The least likely reason was “preventing one’s own infection,” which garnered the lowest average score of 2.57. The academics also studied the association between respondents’ answers across the six topics and the frequency with which they reported wearing masks. The study authors discovered that the practice of donning masks is strongly connected to “peer pressure.” Although face masks are intended to protect others from infection, the connection with that reason was extremely weak. Nakayachi noted the results should be cautiously assessed by policy makers. “The tendency to be affected by peer pressure can be taken advantage of in developing anti-coronavirus measures,” he said. “But that might urge people to watch one another too much, so careful consideration must be paid.”",https://www.asahi.com//ajw/articles/13655141
